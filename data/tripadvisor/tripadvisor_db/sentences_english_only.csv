1,17,6,Gold upgrade not provided.,2018-01-02
1,17,7,I can understand during busy periods however I believe the reason why they couldn't accomodate us was simply that they don't plan properly and advised me they totally ignore the online check in.,2018-01-02

1,120,1,I booked Hilton Tokyo for the last 3 days of a two week holiday as I wanted to stay somewhere special for my birthday but I was disappointed.,2017-10-22
1,120,2,I made the mistake of booking through a third party agent (they had a good deal) - this meant that I was not eligible for free wifi in my room as Hilton only offers this to members of their HHonors program and only if you book directly through the hotel.,2017-10-22
1,120,3,The daily charge for standard wifi is 1000 yen.,2017-10-22

1,120,5,"The day before we were due to check out, I called the guest services hotline to ask the best way to get to Shinjuku Station so we could catch the Narita Express train to the airport but was told that the only way to get there was to walk (I thought this was strange, as I knew there was a free shuttle bus from the Hilton to Shinjuku but thought maybe we weren’t allowed to take luggage on the shuttle).",2017-10-22
1,120,6,"On my way out, I asked the concierge desk to double check and they said we could take the free shuttle even with our luggage.",2017-10-22
1,120,7,Not sure why the information is inconsistent.,2017-10-22
1,120,8,It is also not conveniently located if you want to stay out late.,2017-10-22
1,120,9,"While it is connected to Nishi-Shinjuku station, there is only one subway line passes through here and the walkway closes at around 10pm, which means if you want to get to other parts of Tokyo you’ll have to make a few transfers.",2017-10-22
1,120,10,"The rooms are clean and quite spacious, but I didn’t feel like a valued guest here.",2017-10-22
1,120,11,"There are other, more conveniently located and better value for money hotels in Tokyo.",2017-10-22

1,121,6,"However, there was one concern that I particularly disliked is that the hotel did not have a turndown service, despite staying at their top suite category.",2017-10-22
1,121,7,"I kinda expected something more especially when you are paying for USD 800 a night, perhaps a personalized welcome greetings / special amenities, which would certainly create a much memorable impression for us.",2017-10-22
1,121,8,"Definitely, a turndown service should be implemented!",2017-10-22
1,122,1,This was our first time staying at a Hilton Hotel and it will not be out last!,2017-10-22

1,124,5,My taste exactly!,2017-10-20
1,124,6,You could tell that it was a business hotel given the surrounding neighborhood.,2017-10-20

1,124,8,She was very nice and professional.,2017-10-20
1,124,9,She was able to upgrade our room to the Executive Class in which we never expected even though I’m a Hilton Honors Gold Member.,2017-10-20
1,124,10,Not to mention that she paid full attention to when we were departing and was able to get us a late check out since we were departing later at night and use of the executive lounge to relax in.,2017-10-20

1,135,8,"On the whole, it had been a very pleasant stay!",2017-10-14
1,136,1,"We had heard that Japanese rooms were small, but to be fair we thought ours on the 36th floor was more than adequate.",2017-10-14

1,137,9,"Again, we are told that due to the booking being made through an agent, that the request will not be entertained.",2017-10-14
1,137,10,That is perhaps the worst and most absurd reason to refuse late check-out.,2017-10-14
1,137,11,So the hotel wants to make it clear that it doesn't like us or any other customers for booking through an agent.,2017-10-14
1,137,12,"If you don't like agents, then don't sell your rooms through them.",2017-10-14

1,138,3,"Not sure what our original booking would have looked like but when we arrived in our 'upgraded' room we were disappointed to find it was tiny, drab and tired.",2017-10-13
1,138,4,We were perplexed as to how they were going to fit an extra bed in also (there were only two in the room and a third was supposedly being sent up right away).,2017-10-13
1,138,5,We were forced to go out and look around shinjuku (although we wanted to sleep) as the third bed never eventuated.,2017-10-13
1,138,6,"7 hours later at 10.30pm it was still not there, at which point we enquired as to where it was - we then still waited another half an hour for this mysterious bed to arrive, which it finally did 8 hours after we checked in.",2017-10-13
1,138,7,"It was shoved into the only remaining spare space and the only chair in the room was taken away, leaving no room for bags or to walk around.",2017-10-13
1,138,8,"Service was slow, internet was only free on the 1st and 2nd floor of the hotel which is unheard of in this day and age.",2017-10-13
1,138,9,Would definitely not bother staying here in the future - there are much cheaper and better quality hotels!,2017-10-13
1,139,1,"Located in the happening area of Tokyo, called Shinjuku, this hotel offers large comfortable rooms with excellent service.",2017-10-12

1,143,3,I arrived at check in and the gentleman who was operating the reception/check in area could not have been more helpful.,2017-10-09
1,143,4,"It would have been so easy for him to confirm that check in was not until the afternoon, but he checked through his system for a while to not only find me a room, but due to my Hilton Honors status, I was upgraded to a suite.",2017-10-09
1,143,5,This was way beyond my expectations as I would have been quite happy to have been allocated my standard club room that I paid for.,2017-10-09

1,241,7,This would make the hotel a worldwide destination.,2017-08-01
1,241,8,Current pool simply too small for that size of a hotel.,2017-08-01

1,250,6,She charged me the balance and gave me the receipt.,2017-07-23
1,250,7,"Just 5 minute after I left, she made a NEW transition and charged me again US 508 without providing a receipt.",2017-07-23

1,320,4,"There is really only one thing about which I could even begin to complain: the air conditioning does not seem to take the humidity out of the air, and the bathroom has no apparent ventilation so there is a musty smell in the bathroom that does become troublesome.",2017-06-16
1,321,1,The staff here are extremely well trained and helpful.,2017-06-15

1,324,2,"The bus ride is about 45 m (with jam), and from Haneda, about 1000 yen.",2017-06-12
1,324,3,(it would be 3100 yen from Narita).,2017-06-12

1,324,7,"(yes, cabs in Japan are expensive).",2017-06-12

1,329,6,A cup of coffee cost $10 and an Asahi was $12.,2017-06-09
1,330,1,"I am delighted that on our second visit to this property (see my other review from 2015) not only it has maintained its exceedingly high standards, but it became even better thanks to improvements to key areas that Honors members appreciate, such as the Executive Lounge, and the opening of a new and superb Japanese-style bento-like breakfast exprience on the 2nd floor (make sure to book).",2017-06-09

1,330,8,"Well done, Hilton!",2017-06-09
1,331,1,"Fantastic accommodation, rooms are a great size (apposed to the fact Japan is well known for the hotel rooms being small) There is a gorgeous little Jazz bar on the top level of the hotel (absolutely love it) and there are shops bottom level also which the little grocery store is open till a decent time for a night cap ;) the hotel is only a short stroll from Tokyo's busiest district in Shinjuku and I found myself always ending up at the famous Pedestrian Scramble (which was super handy for an easy gauge on location) lost's of places nearby to eat however, there is fantastic restaurant options at the hotel as well.",2017-06-08

1,332,9,Watch out for the Airport bus - it took me over two hours to get to Narita.,2017-06-08
1,332,10,45 minutes was taken to get around all the stops before we even left the neighbourhood.,2017-06-08
1,332,11,The bus is much cheaper than a taxi but the Hotel told me we would be one of the last stops and go straight out to the airport.,2017-06-08

1,349,6,"The only thing keeping the rest of the bathroom dry was an old fashioned glass divider that was less than 1/3 the length of the tub - needless to say, it didn't do a good job of keeping the place very dry, especially since the hotel had excellent water pressure!",2017-05-30
1,349,7,:D,2017-05-30
1,349,8,The airconditioning rattled somewhat at certain settings.,2017-05-30

1,355,6,"Despite its size, the 1st floor lobby offers a small sitting area.",2017-05-26

1,355,8,"As to the shower in our room, the glass panel on the tub was too short in my opinion.",2017-05-26

1,355,10,The hotel has few restaurants (look great but on expensive side).,2017-05-26

1,356,2,"Most hotels were fully booked and overpriced for a small room, hence we decided to spend just a little bit more and got the Suite in Hilton Tokyo.",2017-05-26
1,356,3,"Location: Strategically located in Shinjuku, it is a great tourist spot which is convenient but not in the midst of the hustle and bustle.",2017-05-26

1,356,14,The bathroom was a little small for a large room and the shower area is a little tiny which shares a relatively small bathtub.,2017-05-26
1,356,15,However I liked the strong water pressure and the Thomas Roth toiletries provided.,2017-05-26
1,356,16,Lounge: Staying in a suite means we get free access to the club lounge.,2017-05-26
1,356,17,"As a typical international hotel chain, the lounge was big and had lots of variety of food and beverages, including all kinds of alcohol.",2017-05-26
1,356,18,The only downside was that it was VERY CROWDED.,2017-05-26
1,356,19,It's almost packed every evening when we were there (around 5/6pm) and this means that it can be a little rowdy.,2017-05-26

1,456,6,The executive room on the 37th floor is excellent as well with a great view and great food.The only drawback was that in Japan they only allow three people in a room so we had to get two rooms which was a bit costly.,2017-04-15
1,457,1,This supposed to be 5 star hotel does not give any preference for its hotel guests at its restaurants.,2017-04-14
1,457,2,Outside reservations are taken without any area reserved for hotel guests.,2017-04-14
1,457,3,One would expect that premium rates are charged for the rooms so that hotel guests have the rooms and amenities available for their use and it's very disappointing when restaurant reservations are taken from outside walk-ins with no space left for hotel guests!,2017-04-14

1,459,2,We were three adults so an extra bed in the room - but this made it incredibly small with no where to put anything.,2017-04-13
1,459,3,Bathroom was also very small - especially compared to the IC Hotels we stay at and the seat did not have the all the heating/washing options we had at all the other hotels we stayed at in Japan.,2017-04-13
1,459,4,We stocked up on snacks from the Family Mart down the street which made for a good late night snack on return from a busy day.,2017-04-13
1,459,5,At first they wanted to charge us for wi-fi in the room because I had not booked directly on the Hilton site - which is one of the reasons I normally don't bother with Hilton any more - they are one of the few major brands left that continue to charge for wi-fi - however the woman on the desk relented and gave us free wi-fi.,2017-04-13
1,459,6,There is a free shuttle from Shinjuku JR but we could not find it - gave up and took a taxi.,2017-04-13

1,461,12,Would stay here again.,2017-04-12
1,462,1,Stayed here after a few nights at Intercontinental Tokyo Bay. We actually preferred the IC and Tokyo Bay-- felt a bit quieter and actually easier to access the rail lines surprisingly!,2017-04-11
1,462,2,It was a bit of a trek to get where you needed to go and we found taxi was simply faster and not too bad to get to the night district.,2017-04-11
1,462,3,"We had requested an early room and could not get it and email and service was less than responsive in pre-arrival, but the guest relations manager really went above and beyond in helping us with making things right.",2017-04-11
1,462,4,The morning breakfast was quite extensive and a good way to start a day of site-seeing.,2017-04-11
1,462,5,Do yourself a favor and stock up on beer/snacks at the Family Mart down below and save a few $!,2017-04-11

1,463,6,"The best part, however, was the staff.",2017-04-11
1,463,7,They could not have been friendlier or more accommodating.,2017-04-11
1,463,8,"They made suggestions, helped us transfer our luggage to Kyoto, held luggage for our return, made reservations for an airport transfer and answered any and all questions.",2017-04-11
1,463,9,They were genuinely delighted to have us in Tokyo and to help us in any way they could.,2017-04-11
1,463,10,I highly recommend the Hilton Tokyo.,2017-04-11
1,464,1,"So, a Hilton is a Hilton.",2017-04-10
1,464,2,"This one is pretty good, but we thought incredibly overpriced for what it was.",2017-04-10
1,464,3,"Our room was TINY TINY, with two twin beds, even though I had booked a king room.",2017-04-10
1,464,4,"And when I say TINY, I mean TINY ...",2017-04-10
1,464,5,"the bathroom cannot accomodate more than one person at a time, and it has the half shower door, so water gets everywhere.",2017-04-10
1,464,6,"The rooms notwithstanding, the service is beyond reproach.",2017-04-10
1,464,7,"The concierge team is impeccable, as was the service everywhere in the hotel.",2017-04-10
1,464,8,"The gym has treadmill and eliptical machines, so that was convenient.",2017-04-10
1,464,9,"It isn't as in the middle of Shinjuku as I would have liked, but they have a shuttle to the Shinjuku station every twenty minutes, and that makes it easy.",2017-04-10
1,464,10,"It is also right on the M Line, and easy to access via subway.",2017-04-10
1,464,11,"Its expensive for what you get roomwise, but convenient in many other ways.",2017-04-10
1,465,1,"One of the reasons why we have chosen Hilton Tokyo (10 years since 2008) in our annual Japan trip was the awesome gym Hilton has (had), which many hotels are lacking of.",2017-04-09
1,465,2,But things change after the renovation this year (March 2017).,2017-04-09
1,465,3,The gym is still spacious but the layout is just not practical nor functional for resistance/weights training!,2017-04-09
1,465,4,The weights rack/area is moved to this tiny room no more than 10 sq ft (photo 1) and the rest of the weights/machines were placed at another area (photo 3 & 4) which is 15m away (photo 2) that makes it non-conducive for a workout.,2017-04-09
1,465,5,"Guests were clamored for space in the tiny weights room, which can nearly hold more than 4 users.",2017-04-09
1,465,6,"In all the years I have been in this hotel, the gym was always packed during peak hours (morning)!",2017-04-09
1,465,7,"Don't get me wrong, they still have an awesome selection of cardio machines, and still a great fitness center if the layout is to be re-designed (weights section) with the consideration/practicality of a gym (weights) users for cross-functional training.",2017-04-09
1,466,1,"Upon arrival, the manager provided us with a room upgrade for being a diamond member.",2017-04-09
1,466,2,"As the executive lounge was about to close at that time, he provided us with drink vouchers for the bar.",2017-04-09

1,466,7,We found our experience in Japan in general and the Hilton in particular was overwhelmingly positive.,2017-04-09
1,466,8,Would definitely stay here again!,2017-04-09
1,467,1,Ok...,2017-04-09
1,467,2,I didn't find Scarlett Johansson sitting at the bar (it isn't the Park Hyatt) but it really captured the cool vibe that I was hoping to find in a modern Tokyo hotel.,2017-04-09
1,467,3,The aesthetic is clean and minimal combined with touches which emphasis the hotel's connection to Japanese art and culture.,2017-04-09

1,467,7,The air conditioning was great which can be crucial in Tokyo during the Summer months.,2017-04-09
1,467,8,"Overall the hotel seemed better than its price point and is probably at the top end of the ""Hilton"" branded hotels in the world.",2017-04-09
1,467,9,I could live here!,2017-04-09
1,468,1,"As first time visitors to Japan, the Hilton Tokyo did not disappoint.The location was perfect, away from all the hustle and bustle and just a short 5 minute free shuttle bus ride to Shinjuku Station.",2017-04-08
1,468,2,"We had two adjoining rooms to accommodate our family of four, which were comfortable and very clean.",2017-04-08

1,469,1,We booked the Hilton Shinjuku mostly due to its location.,2017-04-08
1,469,2,It was easy to get to from Haneda airport (we took the friendly limousine bus which took roughly 70 minutes) and several underground stations were in (underpass) walking distance.,2017-04-08
1,469,3,This was convenient although it was a 10 minutes walk to get to the subway lines.,2017-04-08
1,469,4,We received a high floor room and the view was really great.,2017-04-08
1,469,5,The size of the room was good for Tokyo standards (especially compared to my stay at the tiny room at Unizo Shibuya).,2017-04-08
1,469,6,"However, the bathroom was comparably small.",2017-04-08
1,469,7,"With one sink, toilet, walk-in shower and bathtub you cannot use the bath with two pax at the same time.",2017-04-08
1,469,8,No problem for us though and we especially enjoyed the shower - since there are rooms with shower-in-tub layout.,2017-04-08
1,469,9,"Check-in, checkout and all members of staff in general were polite, helpful, smiling and efficient.",2017-04-08
1,469,10,Contrary to other reviews we had no lines at check in (we arrived in the morning) even though the hotel was fully booked (we did not receive a room upgrade as Diamond members),2017-04-08
1,469,11,We were very fortunate to have access to the executive & diamond lounge which we felt rendered the price/value ratio much more favorable.,2017-04-08
1,469,12,We had breakfast and pre dinner drinks in the lounge and it was fantastic.,2017-04-08
1,469,13,"Actually, the breakfast selection down at the Marble Lounge felt not as good as in the lounge (although it's still a good breakfast).",2017-04-08
1,469,14,We stayed four nights and would definitely come back.,2017-04-08
1,469,15,"In my personal opinion the Hilton is a very good hotel, just not *exactly* 5 star (more like 4,5*) considering services like turndown service, fresh water, welcome amenities, etc that you might get in high-end 5-stars.",2017-04-08
1,469,16,We are happy with the choice.,2017-04-08
1,470,1,I stayed here for four nights at the end of November 2016.,2017-04-08
1,470,2,"Shinjuku is a very good base for a tourist, and the Tokyo Hilton the best option in Shinjuku, starting with the fact that the airport limousine bus will drop you right at the hotel - important when you've just got off a long flight and need looking after.",2017-04-08

1,473,1,"Being a diamond Hilton Honors member you would think they would ensure that they treat us well however not only did they put us in a smoking room, but then accused us of being at fault since we selected the room using the online check-in app.",2017-04-07
1,473,2,The app only provided us with two rooms to choose from which didn't notify us that it was a smoking room.,2017-04-07
1,473,3,In addition to this when the room was booked we specifically requested non-smoking.,2017-04-07
1,473,4,They then told us that there are no more rooms available and that we would have to sleep in the rooms overnight before they could change our rooms.,2017-04-07
1,473,5,It wasn't only until after I complained stating that I wouldn't sleep in a room that smells of smoke that they found us a room that we would be able to sleep in but would have to leave by 8am the next morning due to another guest having to move in.,2017-04-07
1,473,6,Regardless of the fact that when we came to check in earlier at around 12pm we were told our room wasn't ready (if we were able to see the room earlier would have been able to notify them of the issue).,2017-04-07
1,473,7,Great way to treat your guests Hilton....,2017-04-07

1,480,2,"However, unfortunately it would miss out on some and maybe most of the qualities to give you the touch and feel of a 5 star hotel.",2017-04-05

1,556,4,It was so crowded and overfilled I was told to go and wait in my room and they would call me when/if it was any seat available!!,2017-02-13

1,559,13,"(I think she was bespectacled and I can't remember her name, but she really smoothened matters by acceding to our unusual, last minute request.)

1,559,24,"- The bathrooms were a bit small, although I know we're talking about Tokyo here.",2017-02-13
1,559,25,"All the same, I can't help thinking that the rooms at the Granvia Kyoto were a lot more spacious (bathrooms and wide-ranging toiletries too!) and they weren't even suites.",2017-02-13

1,789,7,"In fact, I would go as far as to say, that if you come to Tokyo on business, do not stay here.",2016-09-13

1,789,9,"Upon checking in at midnight, we were advised that the Business Centre would be open in the morning, and able to provide translation services for us.",2016-09-13

1,789,22,"As there were no dedicated Business Centre staff, we had to hire in a translator to help with the communications.",2016-09-13
1,789,23,"Not ideal, but on its own not a deal breaker either.",2016-09-13
1,789,24,"However, without a quiet room to work from or a phone to work with, we were forced to retreat to our bedroom to make the calls.",2016-09-13

1,802,9,The breakfast is the same way.,2016-09-05
1,802,10,"Although the selection is a little limited, if you have lounge access, it would be wise to utilize the Exec Lounge for breakfast because the 1st-floor restaurant can get absolutely chaotic--and I don't remember this happening until a few years ago.",2016-09-05
1,802,11,Perhaps it's time for them to implement some serious crowd-control strategies.,2016-09-05

1,802,13,"For instance, the last time my same-sex spouse and I checked in, the Japanese male agent wanted to confirm a couple of times that we knew our junior suite only had one king-size bed.",2016-09-05
1,802,14,"When he realized that we were a couple, his attitude changed completely.",2016-09-05
1,802,15,"It's 2016, and it is Hilton.",2016-09-05
1,802,16,"Maybe the manager needs to remind the employees that, at times, they may get same-sex couples whom they should treat with equal respect?",2016-09-05
1,802,17,"This was shocking to me because, in my 20+ years of visiting Japan frequently, I've found the Japanese--male or female--to be very gay friendly.",2016-09-05
1,802,18,"More importantly, my spouse and I have been staying at Hilton Tokyo since the 1990s, and this has never happened before.",2016-09-05

1,802,21,"Although he had been friendly up to that point, he made his discontent somewhat clear when I asked him to go over the charges.",2016-09-05
1,802,22,"I should have perhaps pointed out to him that this entire transaction could have been prevented, had he done his job and taken an extra 6.5 seconds to inform us of the total charges.",2016-09-05
1,802,23,"Just 10 years ago, these things would have been unthinkable at Hilton Tokyo.",2016-09-05
1,802,24,"There are so many nice hotels in Tokyo that offer more updated infrastructure, good meal options and great service these days (heck, in Japan, the cheapest of the hotels would give you pretty good service!) but, as an HHonors elite member, I prefer to stick with Hilton.",2016-09-05
1,802,25,"Luckily, another Hilton, Hilton Tokyo Odaiba, has recently opened in (relatively) central Tokyo, and I find its infrastructure, service and meal options to be far superior--although it is in an area that COULD be slightly trickier to navigate.",2016-09-05
1,802,26,"I really WANT TO like Hilton Tokyo and WANT TO stay with them because I prefer Shinjuku over Odaiba, but they have been slipping a little in the recent years.",2016-09-05

1,804,3,"Check in was pretty quick, however there's no signages to tell you where to stand and wait for check in or out.",2016-09-02
1,804,4,So guests are just standing anywhere and everywhere.,2016-09-02
1,804,5,A little confusing.,2016-09-02
1,804,6,Room was decent and big for Japanese standard but a little worn out.,2016-09-02
1,804,7,"One downside of the room that I really need to point out is the carpet, it looks and feels filthy dirty.",2016-09-02
1,804,8,"I stepped on some sticky residue 3 times and god knows what it is, I had to place napkins on the spots so please do wear the bathroom slippers provided.",2016-09-02
1,804,9,I got them to clean the carpet twice !!,2016-09-02
1,804,10,Generally all the Japanese staff were friendly and helpful I really appreciate it.,2016-09-02
1,804,11,"But this particular staff ""Mari*a"" at the concierge was not very sincere in helping when I asked for directions and informations, she doesn't even look you in the eye and I felt she just wants me to leave her alone.",2016-09-02
1,804,12,So I approach a Japanese staff later and she made it all very clear.,2016-09-02
1,804,13,"I was staying at the Hilton Narita earlier in August, I must say Hilton Tokyo Hotel and the one at Narita are worlds apart!!",2016-09-02
1,804,14,"I will never ever stay at Hilton Narita again , service was really at the rock bottom and that was my first Hilton experience they totally ruined it.",2016-09-02
1,804,15,However Hilton Tokyo changed my first impression that I had from Hilton Narita.,2016-09-02
1,804,16,I will definitely stay at Hilton Tokyo in my 5 upcoming trips next year !!,2016-09-02

1,806,1,Good hotel for room quality (cleaning) and staff courtesy.,2016-09-02
1,806,2,"A good position in Shinjuku, near the main station (about 10 minute by feet) and the metro service is linked directly to the hotel lobby.",2016-09-02
1,806,3,Maybe the quality/price can be improved (for example providing a bottle of water everyday like other hotel chains of the same level).,2016-09-02
1,807,1,I have been visiting Hilton Tokyo regularly for many years.,2016-09-02

1,871,2,My only comment is that a hotel such as this should have a bar on the top floor as the views of the city would make it a Tokyo highlight.,2016-07-28
1,871,3,"Maybe next time, Hilton people!",2016-07-28
1,872,1,"I don't have a single complaint -- because of my work, I ended up having to do room service quite a bit, not able to get out much -- and everyone who assisted me was beyond helpful!",2016-07-28
1,872,2,Naturally the room service prices were pricey -- this is a 5-star hotel in Tokyo -- I didn't expect anything less to be honest.,2016-07-28

1,872,5,"On the way there, my flight landed to late to be dropped off at the hotel.",2016-07-28
1,872,6,So I had to go to Shinjuku Station and walk (half a mile maybe?) to the hotel - not too bad.,2016-07-28

1,873,8,The executive lounge is great for both breakfast & cocktails.,2016-07-28
1,873,9,"Only downside for me is that the gym, while well equipped, is a small room and therefore pretty crowded at prime time.",2016-07-28
1,873,10,"On the other hand, it is open 24 hours a day so maybe try to avoid the morning rush.",2016-07-28
1,874,1,"Dinner buffet was pretty much average, I would've expected a bigger variety of food, as far as types of dishes, flavors and more.",2016-07-27

1,877,1,Stayed at a junior suite at Hilton Tokyo for a family vacation with our two adult-sized teenagers.,2016-07-25
1,877,2,The hotel was chosen mainly due to its central location and the room size that appeared to be sufficient for the four of us.,2016-07-25
1,877,3,The room had a king size bed and we asked for a roll away bed which was twin-size at no extra cost.,2016-07-25
1,877,4,The room also had a modular sofa and was large enough to lay open our four suitcases.,2016-07-25
1,877,5,One slight issue was with the size of the bathroom.,2016-07-25
1,877,6,"There was not much counter space, and I never understood when hotels choose to use a piece of glass that covers less than half the shower instead of a shower curtain or other means to block water.",2016-07-25
1,877,7,The obvious result was the wet bathroom floor.,2016-07-25
1,877,8,"Other than that, it meets all our travel needs.",2016-07-25
1,877,9,There was a convenient store in the basement that opened 24 hours; it was (strangely) a hit for our kids and the items appeared to be regularly priced.,2016-07-25

1,897,9,It leaves every 15 minutes.,2016-07-18
1,897,10,I would definitely stay here again.,2016-07-18
1,897,11,I would recommend this if you want to be in a quiet area away from the hustle and bustle but can easily get to the shopping area of Shinjuku if you feel like going.,2016-07-18
1,897,12,Good Job Hilton for making our stay comfortable and convenient.,2016-07-18
1,898,1,Due to the location it's always filled with tourists and people who are briefly stopping over on the way to somewhere else.,2016-07-17
1,898,2,I do like the atmosphere but it's not exactly relaxing mood if that's what you are looking for.,2016-07-17
1,898,3,For dinner we ate at dynasty (superb meals although somewhat slow service.,2016-07-17
1,898,4,But this was during 3-day long holidays) and I do recommend the place to everyone especially if you wanna try good Chinese food.,2016-07-17
1,898,5,Restaurants are only on 2nd floor and that's one of the drawbacks of staying at this hotel..,2016-07-17
1,898,6,Even though the building itself is pretty tall you don't get to enjoy the view unless you stay at higher floor.,2016-07-17

1,900,2,The 'Limousine Bus' service from Narita airport was so convenient and inexpensive and it dropped us right outside the hotel.,2016-07-16
1,900,3,The trip takes about 1.5hours.,2016-07-16
1,900,4,We had the option of the Narita Express train but the thought of navigating our way through Shinjuku with all our luggage meant the bus was a far better option.,2016-07-16
1,900,5,I'm sure this must be one of Hilton's signature hotels.,2016-07-16
1,900,6,It has a commanding presence on the street with a grand lobby entrance.,2016-07-16
1,900,7,It is located a short walk from central Shinjuku - probably about 20 minutes.,2016-07-16

1,900,9,"The room was a decent size by Tokyo standards with a bathroom with separate bath and shower, however, the design could have been better as most of the water from the shower ends up missing you and falls in the bath.",2016-07-16
1,900,10,"Of course, we all love Japanese toilets - so high tech.",2016-07-16
1,900,11,A higher floor would have been a bonus given the fantastic views over Tokyo the higher up you are.,2016-07-16

1,900,16,The subway system was easy to navigate.,2016-07-16
1,900,17,All their advice made our short stay so efficient and hassle-free.,2016-07-16
1,900,18,I thought breakfast in the lounge was fairly standard.,2016-07-16
1,900,19,The hot breakfast options were limited and didn't look that appealing.,2016-07-16
1,900,20,I did love the fresh orange juice machine.,2016-07-16

1,902,1,We enjoyed every aspect of our stay here.,2016-07-13
1,902,2,Everyone we interacted with went above and beyond to make everything perfect (to the extent that people would see us heading to the elevator bank and rush over to push buttons for us).,2016-07-13
1,902,3,We stayed in a king deluxe room which was spacious compared to other hotels we stayed in while in Japan.,2016-07-13

1,902,7,"The American section was a little atypical for breakfast (ex: steamed broccoli, baked beans) but everything else was really nice.",2016-07-13
1,902,8,"As HHonors members (free to sign up), you get to eat breakfast on the second floor where the selection is the same as the larger buffet downstairs but it's much quieter and the ratio of staff to guests is way better.",2016-07-13
1,902,9,Loved that the hotel has its own subway entrance.,2016-07-13
1,902,10,It made getting around the city a breeze.,2016-07-13
1,902,11,The food selections around the hotel are not as plentiful as in other areas so we typically ate dinner before coming back at night.,2016-07-13

1,904,2,"It was difficult to find a hotel which would allow us to book on New Years Day and this was one of the few hotels which had space, we were glad we booked!",2016-07-13
1,904,3,"The rooms are massive by Tokyo standards, we were quite shocked when we opened the door.",2016-07-13
1,904,4,The view over the city was lovely as well.,2016-07-13

1,904,7,We would stay again if we come back to Japan.,2016-07-13
1,905,1,"We weren't aware of the shuttle bus that was mentioned in a few other reviews, and so wound up walking to and from Shinjuku station.",2016-07-13
1,905,2,It's a bit of a hike - nearly a kilometre.,2016-07-13
1,905,3,"The hotel itself is nice, and what you'd expect from a Hilton in a major urban centre - clean, decently-sized rooms.",2016-07-13
1,905,4,"No ""wow"" factor, but reliable, comfortable and worthwhile.",2016-07-13

1,907,11,There was an omelet station which was nice.,2016-07-12

1,909,5,Nearby restaurant also available.,2016-07-11

1,910,5,"I usually take the Narita Express to Shinjuku station which is much faster and more convenient than the Limousine Bus if you can handle your own luggage and with the Century Southern Tower, would have rolled my luggage over to the hotel but with the Hilton, had to wait for the shuttle due to the distance to the hotel.",2016-07-11
1,910,6,The shuttle runs until 8 or 9 at night and starts early morning.,2016-07-11

1,910,9,"Air conditioning is fantastic, which really helped as Tokyo was in a heat wave with temperatures in the 30s Celsius.",2016-07-11
1,910,10,Japanese hotels tend to set the air con at 24 Celsius or so and therefore it was refreshing to have a hotel that does not reset to the higher temperature and that also can blast truly cold air con.,2016-07-11
1,910,11,The window had a sliding shoji screen type covering as well as full sliding wall type covering to block out both the light and heat of the sun.,2016-07-11
1,910,12,"While there was lots of room in the hotel room and a nice chair in the corner, what was missing was a little side table or something on which one could rest a drink or some snacks while sitting back to watch TV.",2016-07-11
1,910,13,"Lots of channels on the TV including several English language news, movie and entertainment channels.",2016-07-11

1,910,16,"They fixed it twice but each time, it only worked once before being locked and unable to be opened again.",2016-07-11
1,910,17,I think language was a problem with some staff except the concierge and front desk staff as the person sent to fix my in room safe indicated in broken language after fixing the safe that it was not reliable to use and then carried in a smaller portable safe that weighed maybe 15 lbs or so which he suggested I use instead.,2016-07-11
1,910,18,"I then went to reception and explained to a very helpful Mr. Hiroyuki Ohashi, the front desk shift leader for the evening, the humour of leaving me a portable safe and, notwithstanding I said it was no longer important as I had only one more night to stay at the hotel, Mr. Ohashi very efficiently arranged for the safe to be fixed properly on the third try and in addition advised the Executive Housekeeper Takao Kuroda who left me a very nice letter apologizing for the problems with the safe and also complimentary wine and chocolates.",2016-07-11
1,910,19,I had the buffet breakfast in the lobby restaurant each day as it was included in my rate.,2016-07-11
1,910,20,"There was a very large selection of food, an omelet station, the usual bacon, eggs, sausages, some Japanese breakfast foods including one grilled fish item per day, and one Chinese item per day (shrimp dumpling, then pork siu mai and then sweet buns for the 3 days I was there).",2016-07-11
1,910,21,The breakfast restaurant can be very busy on the weekend with a bit of waiting to be seated even at around 8 am in the morning.,2016-07-11
1,910,22,"A bit disappointed though the coffee tends to be American Starbucks strong and bitter but without much taste, as generally Tokyo restaurants and hotels serve really good tasting coffee as the Japanese are pickier and willing to pay more for coffee beans than other nations.",2016-07-11
1,910,23,Clientele is very international at the Hilton Tokyo with lots of business people but also lots of families and international vacationers.,2016-07-11
1,910,24,The hotels seems very busy at all times and seems quite full.,2016-07-11
1,910,25,Overall a good hotel with great facilities but a bit far in terms of walking distance to Shinjuku station if you are more of a leisure traveller rather than business traveller.,2016-07-11
1,910,26,I noticed in walking to Shinjuku station that I passed the well known Keio Plaza Hotel on the way and that it is several blocks closer to the station.,2016-07-11
1,911,1,We booked the Executive King JR suite and were upgraded to the King Tower Suite (we were told room 3801 was their biggest room) - it offered amazing view of Tokyo and Mt Fuji is visible from the room on a clear day - just stunning!,2016-07-11

1,911,3,We mainly used it for breakfast.,2016-07-11
1,911,4,"The room was well appointed with a spa bath tub and Peter Thomas Roth amenities (similar to other Hilton's around the world), water bottles, tea, Nespresso coffee machine and a well stocked mini bar but did not use as the Executive Lounge is just downstairs.",2016-07-11
1,911,5,In-room dining was quick and nice (standard international pricing for in-room dining including service fee so not cheap but very convenient especially when the kids are exhausted from a long trip to Hakone).,2016-07-11
1,911,6,Buffet dinner was in the form of a lounge setting and atmosphere so very comfortable.,2016-07-11
1,911,7,The variety of food is not as extensive as you would expect from an international hotel but it was enough for us.,2016-07-11
1,911,8,It did however have an impressive Alice in Wonderland dessert spread.,2016-07-11
1,911,9,"The staff, from the front desk to the housekeeper, were excellent.",2016-07-11

1,911,12,"Whilst the hotel is walkable to Shinjuku station, there is a complimentary bus every 20 mins to and from the hotel so makes the visit to Shinjuku station very convenient.",2016-07-11
1,911,13,"Unlike the Four Seasons in Marounouchi, Hilton Tokyo does not have a stroller to borrow (something that they can consider).",2016-07-11
1,911,14,Overall a very pleasant stay at the Hilton Tokyo and we will certainly return if visiting Shinjuku.,2016-07-11
1,912,1,Great location.,2016-07-11
1,912,2,Great staff and many restaurants to choose from.,2016-07-11
1,912,3,It's a bit expensive but there are many different and cheaper options downstairs where it's connected to a shopping arcade..Close to the train station.,2016-07-11
1,913,1,"The hotel is well located near Shinjuku Station, so coming from Kyoto is easy.",2016-07-11
1,913,2,We caught the bullet train to Shinagawa and transferred to the Yamanote line to Shinjuku.,2016-07-11
1,913,3,We then walked the 10 minutes to the hotel.,2016-07-11
1,913,4,"it was an easy walk, even with luggage and most of it is undercover so it is manageable also in wet weather.",2016-07-11
1,913,5,"The hotel is very busy and relatively impersonal but there are a number of very good restaurants (which we enjoyed), There is an arcade of shops underneath the hotel, if you are so inclined.",2016-07-11

1,913,8,"Even with three adults we had LOTS of room, including a desk, lounge and chairs.",2016-07-11
1,913,9,We were very comfortable and had ample room for all our luggage - we were not falling over the top of each other trying to move around.,2016-07-11
1,913,10,"The wi fi is very good, although the room is short of powerpoints for charging multiple smart phones, laptops etc.",2016-07-11
1,913,11,Complimentary water is provided each day also.,2016-07-11
1,913,12,The breakfast spread is very good.,2016-07-11
1,913,13,"The airport limousine bus service stops at the hotel so departure to Haneda or Narita is convenient, if you do not wish to juggle luggage on the airport train (so lots of options for getting to and from this hotel).",2016-07-11
1,913,14,The hotel is very conveniently located - its strong point.,2016-07-11
1,913,15,"The only reason I gave this hotel four rather than five 'circles' for its rating is that the room, whilst spacious, clean and functional, is looking a bit tired and old fashioned, as were the corridors.",2016-07-11
1,913,16,"At times, you may have to wait a while for the lifts, Having said this, these are not 'deal breakers' and I would happily stay here again, It is a great spot for getting around Tokyo.",2016-07-11

1,968,2,One of our group did not know that he had a strong allergy to buck wheat found in soba noodles.,2016-06-10

1,968,12,Such service and the depth of the concierge staff coverage that would allow the Chief Concierge to stay with us while his staff took care of anything else that came up at the hotel shows you how Hilton trains and develops their staff to be able to address situations such as this without skipping a beat.,2016-06-10
1,968,13,The personal service provided by Mr. Sakamoto was above and beyond the call of his duty at the Hilton or reflects the value the Hilton has for their guests.,2016-06-10

1,968,22,"One thing I would recommend is to include a small stool so that you could take a shower sitting down, prevents the chance of slipping on the soap suds on the floor.",2016-06-10
1,968,23,Inclusion of the small stool would make the bathroom more of an Onsen - traditional setup.,2016-06-10

1,972,2,"As someone who doesn't really enjoy breakfast as much as one should, I was actually pretty happy with the service offered by the staff as well as the variety of their breakfast service.",2016-06-03
1,972,3,I've never been to a hotel that offered such a variety of foods.,2016-06-03
1,972,4,You have the option of enjoying food from outside of Japan or enjoying a traditional Japanese breakfast.,2016-06-03

1,972,10,It's great that they have it set up next to the fruit with humidifiers so they food doesn't dry out and get gross.,2016-06-03
1,972,11,I thought that being in Japan it would be hard to fjnd some good food that reminded me of home but when I tried their french toast and hash browns I have to say that they far exceed what I've had back in Canada.,2016-06-03

1,973,1,Had a couple of days at the Hilton as a base for doing the tourist bit of Tokyo -the location in Shinjuku served my needs very well especially as it seemed to offer more variety on the doorstep in the evenings -lots of shops and restaurants etc....as well as its proximity to a major railway/metro hub.,2016-06-02
1,973,2,"The junior suite was looking a bit dated and tired and the bathroom was the smallest I have experienced on my travels for a long time -needless to say it would have been nicer to have got a refurbished room, maybe better luck next time?!",2016-06-02

1,974,5,We had a problem with noise though.,2016-06-02
1,974,6,It seems either the walls are paper thin or the ceilings are because for our five night stay - during two nights we heard non-stop stomping above us.,2016-06-02
1,974,7,Finally after the second night the hotel manager moved us to the top floor which eliminated the stomping above us.,2016-06-02

1,975,5,The buffet breakfast in the Marble Lounge is good but at peak hour we were seated in the smoke-smelling adjoining bar.,2016-06-02

1,1201,12,I did take a photo but unfortunately it is too blurry to attach here which is a shame as it was quite funny to watch and the staff were also laughing.,2016-01-27

1,1204,6,"However, if I had a question, I found that neither the Receptionists nor the Concierge understood/spoke very good English.",2016-01-26
1,1204,7,Considering that most of the guests are international (including many Airline Crews) the spoken English of the front desk staff should be better.,2016-01-26
1,1204,8,"They did have a Spanish native speaker, which must have been a help to their Spanish speaking guests.",2016-01-26
1,1204,9,"Despite the fact that my husband is Japanese, I could not always summon him to ask the Front Desk something!",2016-01-26

1,1223,1,The service at the Hilton Tokyo was excellent and the staff were well mannered.,2016-01-10

1,1224,1,During booking I selected an option to upgrade to an executive room if available on checkin.,2016-01-09

1,1224,3,However as we were doing the paperwork the two different people checking in on either side of me were also offered the same upgrade to an executive room but for free.,2016-01-09
1,1224,4,"I asked why it was free for them but around 10,000 yen a night for me and was told the difference was that I had selected the upgrade option when booking and they hadn't.",2016-01-09
1,1224,5,"So because I ticked a box on my booking I had to pay 10,000 yen/night while the two other groups got the same thing for free...",2016-01-09
1,1224,6,I therefore told the lady I didn't think I was really getting very good value for that and I would just stick with the original room I booked (I didn't want the upgrade).,2016-01-09
1,1224,7,I was then told that was too late I couldn't have my original room because they had already made up the upgraded room for me.,2016-01-09
1,1224,8,I was then asked to go to the lounge and wait because they were just waiting for people to leave my room so they could make it up.,2016-01-09
1,1224,9,I then queried why it was too late to go back to my original booking then if the upgraded room wasn't actually made up as they had originally claimed.,2016-01-09
1,1224,10,"Finally after checking with the manager it was ok they agreed to let me have the original type of room I booked - and not have to pay an additional 10,000 yen/night for an upgrade I didn't want.",2016-01-09
1,1224,11,After the fun of checkin I thought id let off some frustration by playing a game of tennis.,2016-01-09

1,1224,13,Really Hilton if you are advertising features like a tennis court as amenities on your website is it too much to ask to borrow a few tennis balls to play tennis!,2016-01-09
1,1224,14,"You pay a premium to stay in a 5 star hotel such as this, it's a shame that the service and the inclusions don't match the high price.",2016-01-09

1,1227,6,I would stay here again for sure and recommend it anyone and everyone.,2016-01-07
1,1228,1,I don't typically go for giant hotels (500+ rooms) but the location and price of this was too good to turn down on my first time in Tokyo.,2016-01-07
1,1228,2,"It has over 800 rooms, a lot of restaurants, bars, shopping, spa, pool, fitness rooms, etc but they do a nice job of making sure that the crowds don't add up to long wait times.",2016-01-07
1,1228,3,"Service is friendly, helpful and efficient.",2016-01-07
1,1228,4,The room was surprisingly spacious and since we were on the 33rd floor we had a pretty amazing view of Shinkjuku.,2016-01-07
1,1228,5,"You can walk to many attractions in the area, and it is centrally located to many transport hubs.",2016-01-07
1,1228,6,I thought this was a good hotel for business travelers and travelers new to Tokyo.,2016-01-07
1,1229,1,I stayed here in January 2016 with my husband and 2 kids aged 11 & 14.,2016-01-06
1,1229,2,The hotel is reasonably well located...only 10 mins walk to the Shinjuku Station or a complimentary bus runs regularly to take you there.,2016-01-06
1,1229,3,The room was fine.,2016-01-06
1,1229,4,All four of us were in one room with the kids on rollaways which was fine for 2 nights.,2016-01-06
1,1229,5,We were surprised and disappointed that movies on demand were not available.,2016-01-06
1,1229,6,Other hotels in Tokyo that we had stayed at offered the ability to buy english movies which is helpful when the kids are tired after a long day.,2016-01-06
1,1229,7,The restaurants looked good but were very expensive so we decided not to eat at them.,2016-01-06
1,1229,8,"We ate dinner nearby at a Japanese restaurant ""Hokkaido"" recommended by the concierge.",2016-01-06
1,1229,9,We ate breakfast at the Hilton buffet which was around the expected price for a hotel buffet and fine.,2016-01-06
1,1229,10,The indoor pool is small and was too crowded when the kids went to go for a swim.,2016-01-06
1,1229,11,Wifi is included but restricted to 2 devices at a time which seems a bit outdated for an international hotel chain.,2016-01-06
1,1229,12,The concierge and staff were helpful.,2016-01-06
1,1229,13,Overall I would recommend this hotel.,2016-01-06
1,1230,1,Let me start by saying how AMAZING Japan is!,2016-01-06
1,1230,2,Everything from the people to the cuisine is phenomenal.,2016-01-06
1,1230,3,"Nowhere else (and we’ve traveled quite a bit) are people more hospitable, kind, organized and civilized.",2016-01-06
1,1230,4,"In fact, every country should strive to be more like Japan!",2016-01-06
1,1230,5,Unfortunately our stay at the Hilton wasn’t as great.,2016-01-06
1,1230,6,"We checked in on January 1st and the hotel lobby was a complete MAD house, granted it was January 1st but the crowds were ridiculous.",2016-01-06
1,1230,7,"Already a little hesitant due to the amount of traffic at the hotel, we moved on in the hopes our room would be worth the crowds, especially after being told we had been “upgraded” since we are Hilton Diamond members.",2016-01-06
1,1230,8,"Our so-called “upgrade” was simply getting a room on the executive floor, nothing more.",2016-01-06
1,1230,9,"The actual room (booked using Hilton honor points at a whopping 50,000 points a night) was EXTREMELY small…so small that my medium sized suitcase blocked the door when I laid it on the pre fabricated mounted wall suit case shelf (serious design flaw).",2016-01-06
1,1230,10,The other suite case had to be tucked underneath the television because there was absolutely nowhere else to put it.,2016-01-06
1,1230,11,"The bathroom was outdated and the bathtub had several hairs in it, the AC wasn’t working very well and throughout the night we heard people coughing and walking across the hallway.",2016-01-06
1,1230,12,The room did have a great view of Mount Fuji but I can’t get over how small the room was…,2016-01-06
1,1230,13,"That same night, we headed to the executive lounge for some cocktails in an effort to cheer us up and again we were met by an absurd amount of people, the crowd was so large that folks were lining up outside of the lounge.",2016-01-06
1,1230,14,Never have I ever witnessed such a crowd in an executive lounge.,2016-01-06
1,1230,15,I would highly suggest the hotel invests in a larger lounge if non-Gold and Diamond members are authorized to use the lounge through certain room packages/deals.,2016-01-06
1,1230,16,"The following morning, after a dreadful night, we contacted the front desk and after explaining everything they quickly upgraded us to a suite acknowledging that the so-called “upgrade” wasn’t really an upgrade that they had simply put us on the executive floor…the suite was gorgeous and we were very grateful for the upgrade!",2016-01-06
1,1230,17,"Sadly my ordeal wasn’t over yet however, this time it involved the concierge desk.",2016-01-06
1,1230,18,"That evening, as a result of inaccurate directions, I spent 60 minutes (and $30 on a taxi) searching for a restaurant on a map printed out by the concierge folks that didn’t exist at the address provided.",2016-01-06
1,1230,19,Several neighborhood residents were kind enough to walk me to the address listed on the map but each time we ended up at the same apartment building (no sign of a Japanese restaurant).,2016-01-06
1,1230,20,"Eventually I stopped searching for the restaurant, hopped on the metro and had a quick ramen meal.",2016-01-06
1,1230,21,"Ironically enough, while I received directions and a map from the concierge desk (before departing for the restaurant with a reservation), an older gentleman stormed into the hotel and demanded the concierge desk contact a manager ASAP.",2016-01-06
1,1230,22,It seems that he had been provided (by the concierge desk) incorrect directions.,2016-01-06
1,1230,23,"Right before I stepped away from the desk, he stopped me and forewarned me about his ordeal, little did I know the same would happen to me!",2016-01-06
1,1230,24,During my check out I was hoping someone would ask me how my stay was but no one did hence my review on trip advisor.,2016-01-06
1,1230,25,"As a diamond member, I would have expected a lot more.",2016-01-06
1,1230,26,"The only reason this property is getting three stars is because of how amazing the Japanese people are and how pleasant it was to deal with them on a daily basis, though I must admit some folks at this Hilton are clearly “burnt out” from dealing with tourists (I don’t blame them).",2016-01-06
1,1230,27,My overall advice is to book your stay somewhere else if you want a more personal and intimate experience.,2016-01-06
1,1230,28,This property is a tourist black hole with a lot of traffic.,2016-01-06
1,1230,29,"As a diamond member I would have expected a lot more…Hilton, you can do better than this!",2016-01-06
1,1231,1,We got an amazing room with a view of Mount Fuji on the horizon.,2016-01-06
1,1231,2,"Expert service, very clean, modern and still cozy.",2016-01-06
1,1231,3,"Only downside was there were no restaurant in the hotel that served any vegetarian food, we found an indian restaurant in the ""basement"", it was good food but quite shabby, not connected to the hotel though.",2016-01-06
1,1232,1,The front desk and concerige were really helpful and the service was very efficient at the Tokyo Hilton.English as a second language was not a problem and the food on the club floor was very nice indeed.The location was good as beneath the hotel there were arcades with lovely shops and resturants.,2016-01-05
1,1233,1,We stayed at Hilton for 2 nights.,2016-01-05
1,1233,2,Our flight landed in Tokyo early so we tried to check in early and the staff tried to upsell the executive room to us.,2016-01-05
1,1233,3,He wasnt pushy with the sale but it felt impersonal.,2016-01-05
1,1233,4,"Although it is 5 star hotel and the staff are competant and polite, the hotel made us feel like just another number.",2016-01-05
1,1233,5,There was no personalised service and the experience left us feeling a bit flat and cold.,2016-01-05
1,1233,6,"The room was tastefully decorated and had a nice view of the city, but there was no soundproofing.",2016-01-05
1,1233,7,You could hear the kids runnings in the hallways and talking in other rooms.,2016-01-05
1,1233,8,This contributed to a great lack of sleep.,2016-01-05
1,1233,9,"The hotel kindly organised xmas card, chocolates and wine, the gifts seemed to be generic and without care.",2016-01-05
1,1233,10,The card was also printed out poorly with lines across the sentences showing the printer was running out of ink.,2016-01-05
1,1233,11,Again this reinforces that there was no personalised touch which is something that is expected when staying in a 5 star hotel.,2016-01-05
1,1233,12,"In the end, we didnt feel valued and will not be returning.",2016-01-05
1,1234,1,"The hotel is very nice, with polite and friendly staff as any other Hiltons.",2016-01-05
1,1234,2,"The executive lounge at 37th floor is in the average level in terms of food, I mean, I know better Hilton lounges.",2016-01-05
1,1234,3,But the lounge offers a good view over the streets and surrounding buildings.,2016-01-05
1,1234,4,"The breakfast on the ground floor offers a larger choice of beverages and food than in the lounge, but if you go late, there will be a lot of people.",2016-01-05
1,1234,5,"There is a shuttle bus service every 20 minutes to and from Shinjuku station, which is one of the biggest stations in Tokyo.",2016-01-05
1,1234,6,"So, you will find department stores.",2016-01-05
1,1234,7,"There are also multi-media stores like Biccamera and Yodobashi camera, where you can buy digital cameras, computers, as well as all kinds of peripheral equipment.",2016-01-05
1,1234,8,The only issue is that there are a very limited number of seats in the lobby.,2016-01-05
1,1234,9,"So, for instance, if you decide to take a Limousin bus to go to an airport, you will probably have to wait standing.",2016-01-05
1,1234,10,"A part from that, it is a nice hotel.",2016-01-05
1,1235,1,We stayed at this Hilton twice during our trip to Japan.,2016-01-03
1,1235,2,Once for 3 nights at the beginning and came back for the last 3 nights at the end.,2016-01-03
1,1235,3,"Upon our return, it felt like a ""welcome home""/ This hotel is great and the location and shuttle service are perfect.",2016-01-03
1,1235,4,The concierge desk was very helpful.,2016-01-03
1,1235,5,Breakfast was elaborate and the kids just loved it.,2016-01-03
1,1235,6,The service in the marble lounge was outstanding and the waiters were so friendly and eager to please.,2016-01-03
1,1235,7,"I would like to give a special mention to Hiroaki Shimamune, who really knows customer service and is a major asset to the hotel.",2016-01-03
1,1236,1,Stayed here for a week in February 2015 - the staff is very friendly and helpful and speak good English.,2016-01-03
1,1236,2,"This hotel is in a quiet part of Shinjuku - but only a short walk to Nishi-Shinjuku station and there's also a free shuttle to the very big and busy Shinkjuku station, where you can find a ride to anywhere in Japan......the onsite restaurant and bar were also fantastic with the bar having live music on the weekend evenings and the restaurant having both traditional Japanese and Western style food.",2016-01-03
1,1237,1,Premium hotel that lives up to expectations.Chosen to provide a happy space to rest while visiting Tokyo as a part of Japan trip.,2016-01-03
1,1237,2,No complaints about anything (and I have very high expectations for this level of hotel).,2016-01-03
1,1238,1,Stayed here with my family.,2016-01-03
1,1238,2,Firstly they provide a regular shuttle to Shinjuku station which was handy because we took the train from Narita.,2016-01-03
1,1238,3,Their shuttle is very regular and runs till late.,2016-01-03
1,1238,4,The check in was smooth and no hassles at all.,2016-01-03
1,1238,5,The lobby does get very crowded and not much space for all the tourists they get.,2016-01-03
1,1238,6,"the rooms are big for Toyko standards, and beds are very comfortable.",2016-01-03
1,1238,7,"The hotel does have the 5-star feel to it, and lives up to the Hilton brand name.",2016-01-03
1,1238,8,"There are not much food options around the hotel, so best to take the shuttle to Shinjuku for food.",2016-01-03
1,1238,9,"It is also within walking distance there, about 15 minutes walk.",2016-01-03
1,1238,10,There is a basement walkway to a Metro station which is also very convenient.,2016-01-03
1,1238,11,The walk to that is about 5 minutes.,2016-01-03
1,1238,12,"This station is one which you cannot use JR pass, but it is not expensive.",2016-01-03
1,1238,13,There is a mini mart in the basement too which sells snacks and drinks including beers.,2016-01-03
1,1239,1,This was my 5th stay at this hotel in about 15 years.,2016-01-02
1,1239,2,Services in this hotel are OK.,2016-01-02
1,1239,3,"Compared to many other hotels I stayed in Japan over the years , I must say this is at least now somewhat inferior.",2016-01-02
1,1239,4,I assume handling so many stayers at the same time must be a quite difficult task .,2016-01-02
1,1239,5,Even the excelence of japanese services can't resist the massive numbers Tokyo Hilton have hosted this last week .,2016-01-02
1,1239,6,"For instance, I had to request by phone on occasions additional toilletries .",2016-01-02
1,1239,7,It either took the hotel too long to respond or it did not respond at all .,2016-01-02
1,1239,8,One other time phone communication services was just unavailable .,2016-01-02
1,1239,9,"Also , this Hotel needs a lift-up in most areas.",2016-01-02
1,1239,10,Lobby look small and has a strange staircase that occupies too much space for no clear purpose.,2016-01-02
1,1239,11,"The executive lounge needs also restauration but here services, on the contrary, are absolutely wonderfull and I think this is one of the stongest points of this Hotel.",2016-01-02
1,1239,12,"After all, we had a great stay , thanks to the priviledge of having access to the Lounge!",2016-01-02
1,1240,1,Nice location but not central / good for my preferences.,2016-01-02
1,1240,2,The employees are friendly but rhe English is in general a big limitation.,2016-01-02
1,1240,3,Bar tender needs to be more focus.,2016-01-02
1,1240,4,Very expensive for the sevice and food delivered.,2016-01-02
1,1241,1,Having stayed at hotels around the same area as Hilton Tokyo in Shinjuku made me like this hotel even more.,2016-01-02
1,1241,2,"The Hilton experience begins with check-in, the staff warmly greeted you and welcomed you back to the hotel, just like welcoming you home.",2016-01-02
1,1241,3,"The whole process was a speedy one, as if they had prepared to receive you upon your arrival.",2016-01-02

1,1242,2,We booked executive suites with executive lounge access on the 37th floor.,2016-01-02

1,1245,1,Brand is my first priority to select a hotel to stay during vacation but location is also important too if I am not ready to drive.,2015-12-30
1,1245,2,Hilton is a good brand in my mindset and this is my first time to travel in Tokyo thus I chose Hilton Tokyo as it is very handy to Shinjuku.,2015-12-30
1,1245,3,Hotel offers free shuttle bus from property to Shinjuku train station from the early morning till about 9:40pm.,2015-12-30
1,1245,4,I think if it can extend to mid night that would be much better because taxi is the only transportation at the night time but expensive especially when you have done a long walk at outside.,2015-12-30
1,1245,5,Breakfast is not bad but no surprise.,2015-12-30
1,1245,6,"Personally I love the ""Fresh Green Juice"" very much.",2015-12-30

1,1245,9,Room is good size compare to other lodges in Tokyo.,2015-12-30
1,1245,10,"If I don't have other choices, I would stay at Hilton Tokyo again because the location is good but not too noisy as still 10-15 mins walk from Shinjuku train station.",2015-12-30
1,1246,1,it's a pretty old hotel and that shows.,2015-12-30
1,1246,2,super crowded lobby as well probably because everyone wants the free wifi.,2015-12-30
1,1246,3,"The breakfast was okay, pretty standard stuff.",2015-12-30
1,1246,4,rooms spacious and clean.,2015-12-30

1,1248,2,Three months before I'd arrived I realised the agent had booked one double and two twin rooms.,2015-12-28
1,1248,3,I wanted three double rooms.,2015-12-28
1,1248,4,I emailed the hotel and the agent.,2015-12-28
1,1248,5,Hilton refused to amend the booking until the agent sent a revised confirmation.,2015-12-28
1,1248,6,This didn't materialise so I asked the hotel to do it themselves.,2015-12-28
1,1248,7,The double rooms were actually cheaper and there were plenty available.,2015-12-28
1,1248,8,They refused to help even thought I'd prepaid for the rooms.,2015-12-28
1,1248,9,Months of emailing later they then said they couldn't change the rooms because they were fully booked.,2015-12-28
1,1248,10,Two days before we arrived they emailed to ask if I wanted to spend over a thousand dollars a night upgrading my rooms or whether I would like to downgrade my rooms without a refund.,2015-12-28
1,1248,11,When we checked in we were kept waiting for over half an hour while someone tried to help us.,2015-12-28
1,1248,12,When we asked for a late checkout they refused.,2015-12-28
1,1248,13,The hotel is so busy over this period that they simply don't need your business and don't need to help you.,2015-12-28
1,1248,14,I won't stay in a Hilton again.,2015-12-28
1,1248,15,Aside from that the hotel looks modern and is well finished.,2015-12-28
1,1248,16,The bar and restaurants are good but the service within them varies depending on the attitude of the person serving you.,2015-12-28
1,1248,17,The hotel is two hours from Narita but once at the hotel it is well situated to explore the city.,2015-12-28
1,1248,18,The pool and gym are tiny.,2015-12-28
1,1248,19,The breakfast is average and the location in which it is served is not suitable for a busy international breakfast setting.,2015-12-28
1,1248,20,It is more suited to afternoon tea.,2015-12-28
1,1249,1,"Once you get settled, be sure to check out one of the excellent dining options on the second floor.",2015-12-27
1,1249,2,"Clean, modern and Great service ",2015-12-27

1,1352,9,Wi-fi was strong and consistent.,2015-10-17
1,1352,10,I understand that the hotel has several restaurants; we ate there only one time for the dinner buffet which was really good although a bit pricey.,2015-10-17
1,1352,11,"In the lower level of the hotel is a shopping mall with a number of very small, quaint and traditional Japanese food restaurants along with a well-equipped convenience store.",2015-10-17
1,1352,12,The latter was much appreciated so that we didn't have to scout around the neighborhood looking for snacks and water.,2015-10-17
1,1352,13,"Although the area around the hotel is pretty quiet after 6:00PM each day, there are enough restaurants close-by that it was easy to find something decent to eat.",2015-10-17
1,1352,14,There's even an American/Japanese Denny's across the street behind the hotel.,2015-10-17
1,1352,15,It was rather unique and I'd suggest it to those who stay here.,2015-10-17

1,1353,3,We could not have been more pleased with our choice.,2015-10-17
1,1353,4,The hotel was modern and well kept.,2015-10-17

1,1353,6,Our room selection included access to the executive room and breakfast buffet which had a solid breakfast selection and turned out to be a huge benefit at staying at this hotel.,2015-10-17
1,1353,7,There was also access to the subways by an underground walkway which made it convenient for us to explore the city.,2015-10-17

1,1356,2,Have previously stayed here multiple times and like its proximity to Shinjuku.,2015-10-17
1,1356,3,A shuttle bus is available every 20mins but the walk (10mins) is also a very easy one.,2015-10-17
1,1356,4,Hotel was at capacity during our stay due to some holidays around Asia as well as a public holiday in Japan.,2015-10-17
1,1356,5,I would like to share a positive and negative feedback.,2015-10-17
1,1356,6,"Starting with negative, I personally experienced some attitude from one of the staff during breakfast at the Marble lounge.",2015-10-17
1,1356,7,Monday was a public holiday in Japan and therefore the hotel was at capacity with waiters running around clearing tables for other guests.,2015-10-17
1,1356,8,I only needed some milk for my tea and an extra tea bag.,2015-10-17
1,1356,9,"Instead of disturbing the waiter, as I had to get breakfast from the buffet, I made my way to the coffee making area.",2015-10-17
1,1356,10,"I noticed that the pitchers had syrup in them and when asked the 2 members of staff at the coffee station, Mr Ito pointed using his finger that milk was behind him.",2015-10-17
1,1356,11,I acknowledged and asked whether I could have milk in a pitcher for my tea at my table.,2015-10-17
1,1356,12,The other staff member gladly grabbed a pitcher and filled it up with milk (simple task).,2015-10-17
1,1356,13,"As this was a tea/coffee station, I asked the same member of staff for kindly assisted me for an extra tea bag, Mr Ito seemed annoyed and make some comments in Japanese to the staff.",2015-10-17
1,1356,14,This left me with a bad taste.,2015-10-17
1,1356,15,"As I headed to my table, I shared this experienced with my mother in law (she's Japanese) and she decided to get some mineral water from the same area.",2015-10-17
1,1356,16,"When asked for water, she received a totally different service (from grabbing a glass to pouring the water for her when everything is self serve and in front of her).",2015-10-17
1,1356,17,Is it because she is Japanese and I'm not??,2015-10-17
1,1356,18,I observed Mr Ito over the next couple of days during breakfast and can clearly see that his motivation towards customer service is not his priority (No Omotenashi).,2015-10-17
1,1356,19,"On a positive side, Ms Kobayashi showed great interest in making sure that every guest within her area were well looked after or needed anything.",2015-10-17
1,1356,20,She was always checking for tea/coffee and clearing the table for empty plates.,2015-10-17

1,1356,23,Ms Kobayashi is an individual with full or energy and takes great passion in what she does.,2015-10-17
1,1356,24,A very great asset for this hotel with great potential of doing very well.,2015-10-17
1,1356,25,I do hope that this is the exception as this surely does not reflect the Japanese Omotenashi.,2015-10-17
1,1357,1,As always my stays at the Hilton Tokyo have been amazing.,2015-10-17
1,1357,2,"My last review gives great detail to my first (and continually ongoing) experience at the hotel, this review will cover my Executive Room upgrade and the benefits that go along with it!",2015-10-17
1,1357,3,This review is a little late and I do apologize!,2015-10-17
1,1357,4,It was written right after my stay and stuck in a save file until now!,2015-10-17
1,1357,5,"As expected, my stay at the Hilton Tokyo has been fantastic!",2015-10-17

1,1357,8,The Hilton Tokyo has set my standards for what I expect from any property I stay at - worldwide!,2015-10-17
1,1357,9,"This time around I was lucky enough to get an upgrade to an Executive Room with Executive Lounge access, thank you Hilton Gold status, and I can't tell you how amazing it was.",2015-10-17
1,1357,10,"While I felt that the room itself and the quality of service I received was at the same fantastic level as it always is, the big difference to my stay was the Executive Lounge access.",2015-10-17
1,1357,11,On my first night at the Hilton Tokyo myself and my travel companion returned to the hotel after a day of exploration to enjoy some great snacks and beverages in the Executive Lounge.,2015-10-17
1,1357,12,The lounge itself was on the 37th floor and provided some amazing views of Tokyo at night while we snacked on a variety of hot and cold snacks along with a few beverages.,2015-10-17
1,1357,13,"There were plenty of finger food options (gyoza, small samples of soba noodles, etc,) and my travel companion stuck to soft drinks while I enjoyed a beer or two (or three, or four...) before heading back out into Shinjuku to find an izakaya for our main dinner.",2015-10-17
1,1357,14,On the second night we went to the lounge right at opening time and the concierge invited us to a secondary lounge that at the very least I could call a VIP lounge.,2015-10-17
1,1357,15,"Smaller, more intimate, with a different selection of finger foods, including caviar, this was an absolutely amazing experience.",2015-10-17
1,1357,16,"We spent the whole two hours eating and drinking while we chatted away, to the point where we felt that we really didn't need to go have dinner!",2015-10-17
1,1357,17,"The beverage selection was fantastic and included soft drinks, beer, and a fine selection of hard alcohol choices.",2015-10-17
1,1357,18,"Time flew by as we ate and drank, and before we knew it we were the last ones in the lounge still enjoying our drinks...30 minutes after it closed!",2015-10-17
1,1357,19,Very sheepishly we apologized to the remaining staff members and made our way back to our rooms to relax for the rest of the evening.,2015-10-17
1,1357,20,Another big bonus of my Executive/Gold status was the complimentary buffet breakfast in the morning.,2015-10-17
1,1357,21,"Hilton Gold will allow me to enjoy the buffet breakfast complimentary in the Marble Lounge on the first floor, the Executive Room will allow me to enjoy it in the Executive Lounge as an alternative.",2015-10-17
1,1357,22,The breakfast itself was fantastic with a wide variety of both Asian and Western selections for breakfast.,2015-10-17
1,1357,23,"While I was a bonus to have the Executive Lounge breakfast, I actually enjoyed the selection and atmosphere of the Marble Lounge buffet more.",2015-10-17
1,1357,24,"Overall my stay at the Tokyo Hilton was nothing short of fantastic, as usual!",2015-10-17
1,1357,25,"My Hilton Honors Gold upgrade entitled me to an Executive room with Executive Lounge access which added to my experience, thanks to the free evening beverages and snacks and an alternative place to have my morning breakfast.",2015-10-17
1,1357,26,In all honesty would I book a room at additional cost for Executive access?,2015-10-17
1,1357,27,"If it was a corporate booking and the company was paying for it, yes.",2015-10-17
1,1357,28,"If it was a personal booking and I was paying for it, no(I would hope my status got me the upgrade at no cost).",2015-10-17
1,1357,29,While the free food and drink from the lounge was enjoyable I would have to make sure I drank/ate the difference in price between a regular room and an Executive room - Which quite possibly could easily be beaten by a reasonable night of food and drink at a local izakaya.,2015-10-17
1,1357,30,I don't want to take anything away from the amazing staff at the Hilton Tokyo - There is a reason I am loyal to this hotel - however as a casual/personal traveller I would find it hard to justify the difference between a Executive room and a standard room unless the price difference is very minimal(less than $30/Y3000 per night).,2015-10-17
1,1357,31,Overall my rating of the Hilton Tokyo remains 5/5.,2015-10-17
1,1357,32,I'm always recognized as a return customer and a Hilton HHonors Gold member.,2015-10-17
1,1357,33,ALL the staff are extremely polite and courteous.,2015-10-17
1,1357,34,"The hotel itself has always been clean, comfortable, and enjoyable.",2015-10-17
1,1357,35,Is the Executive Room/Lounge worth it?,2015-10-17
1,1357,36,"Depending on the prices difference and who is paying for it,maybe.",2015-10-17
1,1357,37,"There are lots of local eating options which could meet/beat what the difference is between the two, depending on how much you can eat/drink!",2015-10-17
1,1357,38,Do I recommend the Hilton Tokyo?,2015-10-17
1,1357,39,Absolutely!,2015-10-17
1,1357,40,"As I've said many times the staff are amazing, the location is fantastic, and the rooms are always clean.",2015-10-17
1,1357,41,When it comes to a basic room vs an executive room its up to you to compare the prices and decide what is a better value.,2015-10-17
1,1357,42,"My next goal for the Hilton Tokyo - Finding out what the Golden Key Club is all about, and how I get invited to it!",2015-10-17

1,1359,2,"Rooms are comfortably large, with safe and water boiler.",2015-10-16
1,1359,3,We had requested 2 twin beds.,2015-10-16
1,1359,4,"Our guide subsequently told us twin beds are the norm in Japan, but the Hilton was out of twin rooms, so they installed a roll-away bed along with the queen sized bed already in the room and gave us complimentary breakfast for the trouble!",2015-10-16
1,1359,5,"Could hear some conversations in the corridor, but could not hear any of the street noise below (21st floor overlooking Shinjuku Central Park) except for the rare siren.",2015-10-16
1,1359,6,Breakfast available in the Marble Lounge on the 1st floor beginning at 0630 featured both Japanese and Western fare in their buffet.,2015-10-16

1,1359,8,Would definitely stay here again.,2015-10-16
1,1359,9,Location is 2 blocks from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building and 1 subway stop from Shinjuku Station (or about a 10-15 minute walk).,2015-10-16
1,1360,1,Stayed here and had a conference on site in September ..,2015-10-15
1,1360,2,"It's the Hilton experience which means good service , nice sized rooms but you pay for it ..",2015-10-15
1,1360,3,So a good base but head out of the hotel more reasonably priced meals and the bar on Level 2 could do with some more better bartenders ..,2015-10-15
1,1361,1,The rooms were a good size and very clean.,2015-10-14
1,1361,2,The lobby was nice and all the elevators worked!,2015-10-14

1,1472,26,"We had come from the Disneyland Hotel that had a shower room, which meant the expectation was the water was going to fall directly onto the floor and go down a drain.",2015-08-02
1,1472,27,"In the Hilton Tokyo, there is only a tiny glass divider provided directly next to the shower head, which does not do a great job of stopping the water from getting on the floor.",2015-08-02
1,1472,28,"The floor does have a drain, so maybe this is expected?",2015-08-02
1,1472,29,We were entirely confused.,2015-08-02

1,1615,9,We did try to have a game of tennis when we had a spare 30mins but the cost of using the court and hiring rackets and balls was another surprise- I'm thinking space in Tokyo is so limited all costs must be recouped!,2015-05-29

1,1616,2,"LOCATION: Although it's not in the center of the city (or bustling with nightlife, like Ginza), it was perfect for us because (1) the basement level has a tunnel to the satellite station (NishiShinjuku) of the largest (busiest) train station in the world, Shinjuku (which is alternately just a 13-minute walk directly from the hotel and the center of lots of activity, such as famous department stores and museums)--and our purpose was touring the many widespread attractions of Tokyo and surrounding areas; (2) the hotel is in a business district, so the streets and sidewalks are not over-crowded and nearly empty at night, and very quiet; (3) a peaceful park is right across the street--as are other conveniences, as noted in other review; (4) the views from the higher floors are spectacular; (5) plenty of temporary parking right in front for our private guide for touring outside the city.",2015-05-29
1,1616,3,"ACCOMMODATIONS: As Hilton Gold, we were fortunately and graciously upgraded to a very spacious two-room suite on the 17th floor, affording access to our choice of either the Executive Lounge or the Gold Lounge for huge breakfast buffet and ample evening hors d'oeuvres and desserts.",2015-05-29
1,1616,4,"(My husband had breakfast each morning, and we visited the lounges several evenings.",2015-05-29

1,1616,6,"The staff always graciously provided my husband with a box of soy milk and a banana for me to enjoy in our suite with the vegan items I'd brought from home.)

1,1616,7,STAFF: We experienced genuine graciousness and efficient expertise throughout: from the porters to the receptionists to the concierges & servers at the private lounges to the restaurant staff.,2015-05-29
1,1616,8,"(We dined only one night--in their Japanese restaurant, which is one of several options--to entertain guests, as none of the restaurants could do full vegan meals, but the staff went out of their way to provide items that did work for me, and my husband and our guests found the food outstanding and beautifully presented.) The bell desk staff also took excellent care of having our luggage forwarded to our Osaka hotel (a totally different chain), for which we could put the charges on our bill--and our luggage was in our room at our Osaka hotel when we arrived the next day via bullet train.",2015-05-29
1,1616,9,TIP FOR VEGANS: You can get a good enough breakfast at the Executive Lounge or Gold Lounge--and there's a charming little Indian restaurant in the basement-level shopping arcade.,2015-05-29
1,1616,10,We plan to return to Japan and this hotel will be our first choice!,2015-05-29

1,1620,8,"The only feedback I have is that the station Shinjuku is HUGE - like an underground labyrinth and it is impossible to get the correct exit for the hotel, we spent HOURS underground.",2015-05-28
1,1620,9,The signage in the station is not good and the Hilton staff helped us as best they could but it really was impossible to come out at the right exit.,2015-05-28

1,1621,6,Room size is ok for 1-person but a bit crowded for 2-person.,2015-05-28
1,1621,7,Some cable TV channels are available but not enough for an international brand.,2015-05-28
1,1621,8,Service is acceptable but the staff at concierge are just too cold in service attitude.,2015-05-28

1,1621,14,DISAPPOINTMENTS,2015-05-28
1,1621,15,"1. Proactively asked irrelevant questions before understanding my needs (I just wanted to leave a bag at concierge but the bell boy asked me several questions that are irrelevant to my needs, e.g. when was my flight, have I booked airport shuttle ticket, how many person I am travelling with, and etc) - should ask right question & listen to customer needs",2015-05-28
1,1621,16,2. Breakfast options at executive lounge is very limited.,2015-05-28

1,1622,3,1. the maintenance of this location is horrible.,2015-05-28
1,1622,4,"(given that we go to this hotel because we were told this place has been renovated) damage is everywhere, the sofa in the room got rips and tears that i was embarrassed to have my family member visit me at the hotel, so i end up going to them instead.",2015-05-28
1,1622,5,"and that goes the same with lobby sofa, most of the leather/pleather sofa's got tears and rips, that it was not fixed.",2015-05-28
1,1622,6,"granted it was a busy hotel, wear and tear is to be expected, but to me it was unacceptable appearance.",2015-05-28
1,1622,7,2. this is really not a complain but the bed is firm!,2015-05-28
1,1622,8,"back breaking firm, my wife and I barely got any sleep because the bed is so hard, it feels like sleeping on hard floor, i ended up sleeping on the long sofa because it was softer, the staff was nice enough to add a pad every time we complained but it just gets really lumpy after 3 pads,we had asked to change room, but was informed that every room as the same bed.",2015-05-28
1,1622,9,"so if you like soft bed, this is not a place for you.",2015-05-28
1,1622,10,"3. the Hilton Gold membership gets us wifi, but this wifi is slooooooow.",2015-05-28
1,1622,11,if you want better wifi you would need to upgrade.,2015-05-28

1,1622,13,"4. there IS bus from the hotel to train station, however it's always full!!!",2015-05-28

1,1628,7,"However, our flight is early and I didn't want to panic, so the night before checking out, I went to reception counter asking about payment and ticket of Limousine bus we'd reserved in Japanese 「すみませんが、明日の朝にエアポートバスを予約しましたが、お支払いの事を伺いたいんですが・・・」（Excuse me, we've reserved a Limousine bus on tomorrow morning, so I want to ask about the payment....)　and the staff said to me 「問題ありません。全部はもうすみました」which is mean 'No problem, everything was done' so I thought they will included in the bill when we check-out, but it's not.",2015-05-26
1,1628,8,"On the morning when we're waiting for Limousine Bus, 2-3 staffs help us checking baggage but no one can speak English, they ask us in Japanese 「日本語わかる方いらっしゃいますか？」Which is mean 'Do you have someone who understand Japanese here?' Oh!?",2015-05-26

1,1628,10,"The real problem happened when the bus come and ask us for 'ticket' but, of course, we didn't have that so we have to go to reception counter, where I'd gone their the night before and where the staff had said to me 'everything was done' while many people on the bus had to wait for us buying ticket.",2015-05-26

1,1634,2,"You can easily walk to Harajuku, Shibuya and beyond through the Yoyogi Park.",2015-05-26
1,1634,3,The hotel itself is nicely appointed - we stayed in an executive suite which had a grand view and everything you could need from a hotel room in a metropolis.,2015-05-26
1,1634,4,The Executive Lounge has a really quite decent layout in the evenings with hot and cold appetisers and a good selection of free drinks.,2015-05-26

1,1635,3,"They offered us an upgrade to the executive floor (36/37) for $100 a night, but that didn't seem worth it.",2015-05-25
1,1635,4,"This hotel does everything it's supposed to do - it's relatively central (although definitely not in a cool neighborhood as it's on the quiet west side of Shinjuku which has a CBD vibe), it has all the facilities you'd expect, but it is a little dated and there's no real wow factor.",2015-05-25
1,1635,5,It's a solid 4 star.,2015-05-25
1,1635,6,"When we travelled, however, it was also quite good value.",2015-05-25
1,1635,7,So the message is - make sure you pay 4 star rates.,2015-05-25
1,1635,8,A couple of minor quibbles (none of them major):,2015-05-25
1,1635,9,* The breakfast was pretty average - you can tell most things are frozen - but it did have an omelette station and very nice baguettes (made by their in-house French patisserie).,2015-05-25
1,1635,10,But I'm very food focussed so for most people it would be totally fine.,2015-05-25
1,1635,11,"It gets very busy, especially between 8 and 9 as there are a lot of business travelers.",2015-05-25
1,1635,12,* This hotel is BIG and BUSY.,2015-05-25
1,1635,13,The lift ride from the 34th down to the lobby almost drove me crazy as it would stop on average about 5 or 6 times on the way down.,2015-05-25
1,1635,14,* Gym and pool are average.,2015-05-25
1,1635,15,* There is not much immediately around the hotel - but there are two subway stations 10 minutes walk away.,2015-05-25
1,1635,16,* The hotel floors smell of smoke.,2015-05-25
1,1635,17,"These were all not major issues, but just be aware that the experience just generally lacks the wow factor that might make it 5 star.",2015-05-25
1,1635,18,This is partially because the hotel is just too big to offer that next level of service.,2015-05-25
1,1635,19,"On a more positive note - we ate at the Metropolitan Grill on a couple of nights, and the staff there is ridiculously nice.",2015-05-25
1,1635,20,"Everyone chatted to us, and the chef actually came out and talked to us for 20 minutes on the second night.",2015-05-25
1,1635,21,Really nice people.,2015-05-25
1,1635,22,Can highly recommend.,2015-05-25
1,1635,23,Food was good too (although not cheap).,2015-05-25
1,1636,1,In the heart of Shinjuku's CBD and just ten minutes walk away from the shopping.,2015-05-24
1,1636,2,The rooms are spacious and the view is great.,2015-05-24
1,1636,3,"Most importantly, I am travelling without my baby and breastfeeding.",2015-05-24

1,1662,10,"Service not so good - two out of the three mornings they tried to usher us into an overflow area (smoky bar area), I think because we had kids, as there was space in the main area which I pointed out.",2015-05-04
1,1662,11,"One evening (between 5PM and 6PM) we tried to order some food for the kids in the main lobby restaurant, but were told this was not possible as between 5PM and 6PM they need to clean the tables - seems a bit silly (particularly as round the clock food is advertised in that restaurant), kids were starving so we had to leave the hotel and go elsewhere as we did not want room service.",2015-05-04

1,1668,2,I phoned and emailed in January about request for disabled access room.,2015-05-03
1,1668,3,I have stayed at Hilton hotels before and was confident from the email confirmation that an wheelchair accessible room was available for our stay.,2015-05-03
1,1668,4,On arrival on 28 th April we were advised the room I had confirmed was not available and had been given to other guests.,2015-05-03

1,1668,11,I'm sorry to be so negative but the initial response by the check in counter that its a busy time of year as the reason for the room not being available was appalling.,2015-05-03

1,1669,2,"Main area's, hallways and elevators look like the have just been redone.",2015-05-02

1,1669,4,The traditional Japanese yukata's in the room instead of standard bath robes are a nice touch.,2015-05-02

1,1670,11,There is a shuttle to Shinjuku station but those who are familiar with Tokyo's subway and metro rail system would be quicker to catch it from Tochomae station to get around rather than go all the way to Shinjuku station.,2015-05-02
1,1670,12,You can get to the station using the underpass just outside the hotel.,2015-05-02

1,1676,7,I was not prepared to eat in an area that still smelled terribly of smoke from the night before (stale!!!) so I had to wait for a suitable table in the main area.,2015-04-28

1,1680,14,The wi-fi is not free at this hotel but there is a free business centre with plenty of Mac's which you can use just off from the lobby.,2015-04-27
1,1680,15,It also has a little seating and table area which can be handy to use when you first arrive as the lobby is always busy with little seating available.,2015-04-27
1,1680,16,The hotel does offer a free shuttle bus to Shinjuku station which we did catch on our first day there but it was full each time we saw it depart so we just used to walk the 10 minutes there instead of waiting for it.,2015-04-27
1,1680,17,"There is also 2 metro/subway stations which you can walk to using the underground walkthrough the hotel has, it took us around 5 - 8 minutes to walk too.",2015-04-27
1,1680,18,There is a shopping mall attached to the hotel called Hiltopia which has a couple of small supermarkets in there which are useful for picking up drinks and snacks for the room.,2015-04-27
1,1680,19,There were also a few nice looking restaurants and bars in the hotel but unfortunately we never got the chance to try them as we were always out in Tokyo and preferred to eat in the city.,2015-04-27
1,1680,20,Overall we had a fantastic stay and will definitely stay here again when we visit Tokyo again in the near future.,2015-04-27
1,1681,1,"This is a lovely property, but the service I experienced here was nowhere near what I would expect from a Hilton.",2015-04-26
1,1681,2,"It was, for some reason, shabby.",2015-04-26
1,1681,3,My room wasn't serviced during my two day stay.,2015-04-26
1,1681,4,I don't know why - but certainly no one at the hotel took any action about it.,2015-04-26
1,1681,5,"The real let down was, however, service in the bar.",2015-04-26
1,1681,6,"Even with four staff, and a manager, it took us twenty minutes standing at the bar before we were even allowed to order (there were less than a dozen guests in the place) and a further twenty minutes to get drinks - except, of course, they had forgot my beer entirely.",2015-04-26
1,1681,7,"Terrible, terrible service Hilton: I have to come back to you in a few days - please improve.",2015-04-26
1,1682,1,"I’m sure many of the travelers to this hotel are business travelers, but without a doubt having spent a good amount of time in the lobby, there’s also a sizeable portion of folks there for sight-seeing.",2015-04-26
1,1682,2,"With this taken into consideration, I was surprised at how unhelpful the concierge was in helping us out.",2015-04-26
1,1682,3,"Take, for example, their helping with our trip to check out Sumo practice.",2015-04-26
1,1682,4,They had no connections with any tour companies that could assure a spot at a stable from which to watch the practice.,2015-04-26
1,1682,5,"They did, however, have a map they assured us we could use to find our own and sit in on practices.",2015-04-26
1,1682,6,"So we dutifully showed up in the neighborhood a few days later, map in hand, eager to see things.",2015-04-26
1,1682,7,Turns out the map is completely outdated.,2015-04-26
1,1682,8,"Over an hour of frenetic searching and help from local Japanese, who also couldn’t understand the poorly labeled map, we gave up.",2015-04-26
1,1682,9,Wasted a precious morning.,2015-04-26
1,1682,10,What's strange is that such sub-standard concierge assistance could persist.,2015-04-26
1,1682,11,I’m sure these guys get requests for tourist help all the time.,2015-04-26
1,1682,12,"Perhaps most than any country I’ve ever been to, it would in principle be *very* helpful to have a skilled concierge that could help you navigate the confusing local Japanese system.",2015-04-26
1,1682,13,"Yet these guys can’t help you book train tickets, make tour bookings, or buy a local SIM like I could from a comparably nice hotel in, say, Hong Kong.",2015-04-26
1,1682,14,"I don’t know what the deal is, but one of the big reasons I stayed at this hotel was to get help from the concierge and net-net, it was actually a counterproductive experience.",2015-04-26
1,1683,1,I stayed four nights here with my family in a tower suite.,2015-04-25
1,1683,2,Terrific stay!,2015-04-25
1,1683,3,The staff -- from the check-in agent to the bellman to the concierge -- were incredibly friendly and helpful and went out of their way to accommodate us and make us feel welcome.,2015-04-25
1,1683,4,(Why can't it be more like this in USA?!?).,2015-04-25
1,1683,5,"The room was quite large, especially by Japanese standards (although the sink area was a bit cramped).",2015-04-25
1,1683,6,The fitness center was stocked with great machines.,2015-04-25
1,1683,7,The breakfast was extraordinary; everything you could imagine was available and it all tasted great.,2015-04-25
1,1683,8,"I really liked the convenience of the hotel, connected underground to a subway stop, and a free shuttle bus to the closest JR train station.",2015-04-25
1,1683,9,"On my next trip to Tokyo, I absolutely am returning.",2015-04-25
1,1684,1,"Let's do it fairly, the price is not cheap at all, but the room, is just usual, furniture far from being impressive, the window, you can just open half of it....",2015-04-25
1,1684,2,"In my vie, it is a massive hotel with no personal touch, there are too many people at the lobby, waiting long to get their service and the worst one is, internet in the room is not free (even cheap hotels in Japan can provide it for free.",2015-04-25
1,1684,3,"The good thing is staff is nice, although not really that nice but mechanic (been to other hotel in Japan where the staff is excellently nice...",2015-04-25
1,1684,4,"Hilton might need to seriously think of improvement, service and infrastructure....",2015-04-25
1,1685,1,"Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku is located just 10 min walk from Shinjuku station, hotel has a free shuttle service that start working at 8:00 am.",2015-04-25
1,1685,2,"I got a executive Junior suite at fl 38, giving excellent view over the area, breakfast was a bit boring but still good and as always I comment about food it will depend on your own preference but you will find a eggs station, asian and western food.",2015-04-25
1,1685,3,"AS typically in JApan, service is excellent, people do the real effort to do their job the right way.",2015-04-25
1,1685,4,"Only precaution is that not to much people understand English, then if you don't speak Japanese, be prepared with your printed phrases or as work for you.",2015-04-25
1,1685,5,"I mentioned about the shuttle service starting at 8:00 am for you to be careful that if you need to go to Narita Airport around 10:00 am, you will need to take a taxi(~ 800 Yen)",2015-04-25
1,1685,6,My wife and kids use the indoor pool and they said it was really nice and temperature was perfect.,2015-04-25
1,1685,7,"As usual, Hilton did not disappoint me.",2015-04-25
1,1685,8,It was a bit crowded for check in but I use the Hilton Honors line which is always short.,2015-04-25
1,1686,1,We are a family of 3 adults plus two toddlers.,2015-04-25
1,1686,2,Stayed for 4 nights ( first 2 nights in King executive room n last 2 nights in King city view executive room ) our preferred choice is actually the King city view room which is much bigger n comes with a separate living area.,2015-04-25
1,1686,3,"However, as the hotel is fully booked during our stay, thus the reason why we need to book two different category of room.",2015-04-25
1,1686,4,Service was excellent from the moment u step out of the airport limousine bus ( yes it stop directly infront of the hotel entrance ) the bellboy was already on standby to help with our luggages..,2015-04-25
1,1686,5,Executive rooms check in was supposed to be on the 37th floor but nothing was mentioned in the email confirmation.,2015-04-25
1,1686,6,"Anyway, the lady at the front.",2015-04-25
1,1686,7,Desk was very helpful too.,2015-04-25
1,1686,8,"While waiting to be check in, my elder boy fell and knocked his head against the floor..without us requesting, the lady who is attending to us quickly went and took an ice bag for my boy.",2015-04-25
1,1686,9,This is what we call service and goin g the extra mile for your guest!,2015-04-25
1,1686,10,"As we stayed on both 37th n 38th floor respectively, views was spectacular.",2015-04-25
1,1686,11,"Both rooms were clean and simple, nothing fanciful..breakfast at executive lounge was ok with limited selections ( we choose to ate at the main restaurant instead with more variety ) they also serve pre dinner canapés n drinks which is a bonus if you are back at hotel early.",2015-04-25
1,1686,12,Go for the executive room if you can afford it.,2015-04-25
1,1686,13,"Location wise, I wouldn't give it a five stars even though there is actually a subway linked to the hotel ( is a pretty long walk to the station and it can be tiring walking to and fro esp after a long day out ) there do provide hotel shuttle to shin juku area but do note the last bus back to hotel is at 2140..",2015-04-25
1,1686,14,"If you missed it, the cab fare from shin juku is around 730 yen.",2015-04-25
1,1687,1,"Stayed for a week, and loved every minute of it - although who has time to stay at the hotel when in Tokyo?",2015-04-24
1,1687,2,"Centrally located close to Shinjuku station (about a ten minute walk, although the hotel has a shuttle if needed) and with a subway station available through a 400 meter long underground tunnel, the hotel is accessible in several ways - including direct bus service from Narita (Friendly Airport Limousine).",2015-04-24
1,1687,3,The breakfast was impressive and the hotel staff really made the whole experience something to remember.,2015-04-24
1,1687,4,"We'll be back next time we're in Tokyo, and I have no problem recommending this hotel to anyone travelling to Tokyo!",2015-04-24
1,1688,1,Everyone is so polite and wants to help !,2015-04-24
1,1688,2,Amazing !,2015-04-24
1,1688,3,"The hotel is cool, clean , always full , nice and well located but like all Tokyo , not everyone speaks English so is complicated.",2015-04-24
1,1688,4,Also in the breakfast we got the impression that the lady always wanted to sit us kinda far because we are younger and maybe not dressed as chic as most ( sportswear ) .,2015-04-24
1,1689,1,Stayed for 4 nights & was upgraded to the executive 38th floor ,2015-04-23
1,1689,2,Spectacular views in a newly renovated room,2015-04-23
1,1689,3,All furnishings & fittings are 5 star quality & bed was excellent,2015-04-23

1,1689,5,Breakfast can be a bit chaotic on busy mornings,2015-04-23
1,1689,6,Have to pay for room wifi,2015-04-23
1,1690,1,Long term favourite hotel of mine for business trips to Tokyo.,2015-04-23
1,1690,2,Especially the newly designed Executive rooms are outstanding.,2015-04-23
1,1690,3,And the staff is absolutely excellent and always very friendly.,2015-04-23
1,1690,4,"This time stayed in a Deluxe category room, which is not as modern as the Exec rooms but still very well appointed and comfortable.",2015-04-23
1,1690,5,Good size with ample opportunity also to work on the large glass workdesk.,2015-04-23
1,1690,6,I do however have one observation that slightly reduces my opinion about this hotel.,2015-04-23
1,1690,7,There appear to be more and more large tourist groups which make the hotel loose some of its appeal.,2015-04-23
1,1690,8,"Not only because of the crowded feel in the lobby and at breakfast, but also because of the behaviour of some of these groups.",2015-04-23
1,1690,9,(Maybe Hilton has acquired Nikko Tokyo in the Odaiba area to have that become more of a tourist offering and allow the Hilton in Shinjuku to again became a primary business location.),2015-04-23
1,1690,10,"The tourists groups may also be the reason behind the impression that the breakfast in main restaurant (Lobby) seems to have less variety / class, and the breakfast offering in the Exec Lounge has been upgraded.",2015-04-23
1,1691,1,We choose this hotel because the room are newly renovated and plus the room are quiet large compared with normal hotels in japan.,2015-04-21
1,1691,2,"The breakfast was brilliant and all the staff are very service mind and are ready to help you out , some of the ammentities we request at odd hours , they were able to provide us in 5- 10 minutes time.",2015-04-21
1,1691,3,We really loved the place and would definitely return.,2015-04-21
1,1691,4,"Even though the hotel is a bit of walking distance to JR SHINJUKU STATION, but that is not a problem , they have a shuttle service every 15 minutes to the station.",2015-04-21
1,1691,5,The only cons would be there is NO free wifi in the room.,2015-04-21
1,1692,1,I've stayed at The Hilton Tokyo in Shinjuku twice during the past two weeks.,2015-04-21
1,1692,2,The first time was for three nights immediately after arriving at Narita.,2015-04-21
1,1692,3,A Limousine bus takes you directly from the airport (where you buy your ticket) right to the front door.,2015-04-21
1,1692,4,Couldn't be easier!,2015-04-21
1,1692,5,This is a modern hotel with excellent professional staff who manage to keep things moving swiftly and with ease no matter how crowded it appears to be.,2015-04-21
1,1692,6,My room was on the 38th floor with fantastic views of the city.,2015-04-21
1,1692,7,"It had everything one would expect from a hotel of this caliber (a wonderfully comfortable bed & pillows, good linens, nice bathroom products) but also some much appreciated extra touches such as a coffee machine, sleepwear, slippers and a makeup mirror in the bathroom.",2015-04-21
1,1692,8,"However, there are a couple of things I think they could improve upon, one being the lighting.",2015-04-21
1,1692,9,I found it very dim.,2015-04-21
1,1692,10,And the other would be the wifi.,2015-04-21
1,1692,11,It dropped out constantly AND they charge you for it's use when you are using it from your room!,2015-04-21
1,1692,12,I think this is unreasonable in a world class hotel - and the fact that it didn't work well at that.,2015-04-21
1,1692,13,"They did deduct one 24 hour period from my bill when it barely worked at all, but still, this really isn't good enough.",2015-04-21
1,1692,14,I didn't have breakfast there but there is a wonderful chocolate/pastry shop in the lobby where one can buy a nice croissant or muffin to have with your coffee.,2015-04-21
1,1692,15,There is a free shuttle bus which runs between the hotel and Shinjuku Station regularly and from there one can take advantage of Tokyo's fabulous (and cheap) public transport system.,2015-04-21
1,1692,16,I returned to the Hilton Tokyo for one last night before flying out.,2015-04-21
1,1692,17,"Although my room was the same price as my previous visit, I was a little surprised to find it was significantly smaller (not a huge problem) and that it didn't have a window!",2015-04-21
1,1692,18,"Since I was only there for one night I didn't complain, but I would advise anybody booking to insist upon a room with a window - and hopefully a great view.",2015-04-21
1,1693,1,"For the past four years, my wife & I have celebrated our anniversary in Japan.",2015-04-21
1,1693,2,"Thus, this time we stayed at the Hilton Tokyo to celebrate our anniversary.",2015-04-21
1,1693,3,Encountered some problems at check-in and checkout but I think the root of the problem was the Hilton USA reservation system and not the hotel.,2015-04-21
1,1693,4,"From the moment you walk into the hotel, I knew we chose the right hotel.",2015-04-21
1,1693,5,"The smell, décor and hotel staff smiles said it all.",2015-04-21
1,1693,6,"Stayed in the Executive King and this was just what we were looking for more space, more comfort, and much bigger than those typical hotels in Japan.",2015-04-21
1,1693,7,"As a Hilton Honors Gold member, we had access to the regular Honors lounge, the exclusive Gold & Diamond Honors lounge as well as free breakfast at the wonderful buffet.",2015-04-21
1,1693,8,We do not drink alcohol but in the evening wines and spirits were complimentary.,2015-04-21
1,1693,9,The hors d'oeuvres were great!,2015-04-21
1,1693,10,"I have read other reviews stating the hotel was old, hotel staffs were rude, or it was inconvenient to the JR station.",2015-04-21
1,1693,11,I saw none of this.,2015-04-21
1,1693,12,I feel the Hilton Tokyo was nicer than any Hilton I stayed at.,2015-04-21
1,1693,13,The staffs were not only just professional & polite; they were very sincere in wanting to help make your stay a great experience.,2015-04-21
1,1693,14,The hotel offered a bus shuttle to/from the JR station every 20 minutes and the airport limo stopped right at the hotel.,2015-04-21
1,1693,15,"During our stay, Mr. Tamura, Guest Relations Manager could be seen everywhere in the hotel greeting us and other guests and making sure that everyone was enjoying their stay.",2015-04-21
1,1693,16,I could go on & on how wonderful our stay was or elaborate about the fruits and champagne apology gift but I won’t.,2015-04-21
1,1693,17,"Instead, I will mention one thing that made our hotel stay experience go from wonderful to AWESOME.",2015-04-21
1,1693,18,"As mentioned, I had a problem at checkout.",2015-04-21
1,1693,19,"The hotel could have done nothing AFTER I checked out since after all, I may never return to the hotel again.",2015-04-21
1,1693,20,"To my surprise, I received an email from the Director of Operations, Mr. Cook who asked how my stay was and informed me the problem I had at checkout was corrected and that I would be receiving a refund.",2015-04-21
1,1693,21,"All I can say, Hilton Tokyo in Shinjuku is the hotel we will be staying at in all future trips to Tokyo!!!",2015-04-21

1,1695,3,Very western – rooms where a good size and offered amazing views of the city.,2015-04-19
1,1695,4,The hotel is a little out of the ‘hub’ of Shinjuku however the hotel offers a shuttle bus every 20 mins to the main train station.,2015-04-19
1,1695,5,If you’re arriving from Shinjuku I would either jump on this or grab a taxi (roughly $10 AUD) rather than walking – we got a bit lost and had to drag our suitcases up and down stairs.,2015-04-19
1,1695,6,"The only downfall is that this hotel doesn't offer free Wi-Fi in your room, having travelled between a few hotels it seemed the ‘norm’ for Japan so that was a bit disappointing.",2015-04-19
1,1695,7,All in all a very good stay and I would have no hesitations going back.,2015-04-19
1,1696,1,We spent our last night of our holiday in this hotel.,2015-04-19

1,1698,5,"Easy walk to shin juju, and easy metro just about anywhere else.",2015-04-17
1,1698,6,And the exec suite is soooooo much worth a bit extra cost...not many rooms that size and quality in Tokyo I think.,2015-04-17

1,1701,1,"We stayed in a number of hotels in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto on this trip and the Hilton Hotel Shin-Juku was a big disappointment for us.",2015-04-16
1,1701,2,We found it overpriced with no free Wifi and the noise of the elevators going up and down all night kept us awake.,2015-04-16
1,1701,3,I would not recommend this hotel compared to other far nicer hotels in the area.,2015-04-16

1,1704,2,The service was excellent from start to finish.,2015-04-15
1,1704,3,We stayed one night on a Sunday and then checked out until the Thursday when we stayed for a further 3 nights.,2015-04-15
1,1704,4,They kept our large bags there during this time for free which allowed is to travel around Japan for a few days with just smaller bags.,2015-04-15
1,1704,5,"The location is excellent; just a short walk from Shinjuku main station, or if you are really lazy like us Nishi-Shinjuku or Tochomae metro stations are less than 2 minutes walk away.",2015-04-15
1,1704,6,The transport system in Tokyo is brilliant and once you have accustomed yourself to it nowhere is hard to get to.,2015-04-15
1,1704,7,Get yourself a Pasmo or Suica card as they are accepted on most of the public transport in Tokyo as well as Kyoto and Osaka.,2015-04-15
1,1704,8,I'm sure they are accepted elsewhere too but these are the only places we went to.,2015-04-15
1,1704,9,I would highly recommend this hotel if you are visiting Tokyo.,2015-04-15
1,1705,1,Hilton has always been the international for me when traveling abroad (even though throughout this trip we were not in Hilton all the time) We were recommended to stay in this hotel and it was surely not disappointed with the hotel.,2015-04-15
1,1705,2,Getting there was a bit difficult especially travelling from Shinjuku station.,2015-04-15

1,1705,6,The newly renovated rooms were so modern yet it integrated the Japanese style Ryokan room.,2015-04-15
1,1705,7,I couldn't ask for more to end my stay in Japan.,2015-04-15
1,1705,8,"Out of the 2 Jr Suites, one room was upgraded to a bigger room was literally so big that you could easily sleep another 4 people in it in the living area.",2015-04-15
1,1705,9,I have to say thank you for the Hilton for this upgrade.,2015-04-15
1,1705,10,It was great to entertain guest and serve Nespresso coffee.,2015-04-15
1,1705,11,The toilet in my opinion was a bit small but I guess that was the design of the hotel.,2015-04-15
1,1705,12,The Shower/Tub had a powerful shower though the angle of the shower a bit off as I prefer the shower to rain.,2015-04-15
1,1705,13,"Nevertheless, It had pressure which is most important.",2015-04-15
1,1705,14,The executive lounge upstairs was good for cocktail time and breakfast.,2015-04-15
1,1705,15,"With its freshly squeezed orange juice to their hot food, everything was good.",2015-04-15
1,1705,16,"Of course, it was busy upstairs and the staff was trying their best to manage/clean as much as they could.",2015-04-15
1,1705,17,Not sure whether the hotel provided a turn down service in the evening but it surely would enhance the experience of guest.,2015-04-15
1,1705,18,Service in general was good.,2015-04-15
1,1705,19,The hotel was busy so I guess they couldn't address everyone accordingly.,2015-04-15
1,1705,20,Concierge was always busy but helped me in booking other restaurants around the area and also the Limo Bus to the airport.,2015-04-15
1,1705,21,Free wifi was given which was a super plus point.,2015-04-15
1,1705,22,"If you were to ask me to stay back in Japan, definitely a yes.",2015-04-15
1,1705,23,The value of it is definitely good for its brand and service.,2015-04-15
1,1706,1,"As promised we returned for another visit, and the service in both the cafe and executive lounge was fantastic.",2015-04-15
1,1706,2,"This Hilton had a sign on the front desk that read "" If things are not right we will try to make it better"" and they definitely lived up to that sign.",2015-04-15
1,1706,3,Thanks to Ms Takahashi and manager Mr. Shimamune a problem at check-in was quickly resolved - again THANK YOU.,2015-04-15

1,1706,5,"In other words, a great location, wonderful staff.",2015-04-15

1,1708,1,"We spent a week at this Hilton, which is well situated a short walk from the main Shinjuku JR station.",2015-04-13
1,1708,2,"The hotel provides a complimentary shuttle to the station, but the walk is short and mostly undercover.",2015-04-13
1,1708,3,"All the staff we dealt with were extremely pleasant, efficient and helpful - particularly the reception staff (who provided a complimentary upgrade) and the concierge staff (who assisted with arranging transfers to onward accommodation and reservations at local top-end restaurants).",2015-04-13
1,1708,4,Our 33rd floor Executive King City Suite was furnished in a modern Japanese style and had brilliant views of the city.,2015-04-13

1,1708,6,"The hotel has an indoor pool and, as far as hotels go, an excellent gym with a variety of cardio equipment as well as a free weight bench, medicine balls and weight machines.",2015-04-13
1,1708,7,"I would definitely recommend upgrading to a room with ""Executive"" benefits as this gives you access to the Executive Lounge, meaning you can drop by whenever during the day for complimentary drinks (soft, tea/coffee, alcoholic) and snacks (mostly fruit), as well as afternoon tea and evening drinks.",2015-04-13
1,1708,8,"Breakfast is offered in the lounge as well, although the hotel also allows you to opt to take your ""Executive"" breakfast in the ground-floor restaurant/bar, which is recommended because you then have access to the full breakfast buffet.",2015-04-13
1,1708,9,"The buffet is plentiful, offering the usual large-hotel breakfast fare, with staff on hand to make espresso-based drinks and egg-based breakfast items (omlets etc).",2015-04-13
1,1708,10,I chose this hotel based on its location (close to Shinjuku) and because I picked up a good rate in a Hilton promotion.,2015-04-13
1,1708,11,I would stay again and would gladly recommend it to friends.,2015-04-13
1,1708,12,"The hotel appears to be a favourite of airline crews and tour groups - so if you are looking for a quiet or boutique hotel experience, the Hilton Tokyo probably isn't for you.",2015-04-13
1,1708,13,Otherwise it is difficult to fault the hotel (and I wouldn't fault the staff at all).,2015-04-13

1,1713,11,The food and service in this lounge is even better than at the normal lounge.,2015-04-08
1,1713,12,We had breakfast both in the Exec Lounge and in the Marble Lounge (the primary breakfast restaurant next to the lobby).,2015-04-08
1,1713,13,"Both were good, but the Marble Lounge is of course better being the primary breakfast restaurant.",2015-04-08
1,1713,14,They serve a very good buffet of western and Japanese breakfast items.,2015-04-08

1,1717,2,"My wife and I travel to various location around the world about once a year, sometimes twice.",2015-04-06
1,1717,3,We are leisure travelers who don't mind paying for good service and luxury although we like deals as much as the next person and will try to strike the right balance between cost and benefits.,2015-04-06
1,1717,4,"We were originally booked into the Peninsula hotel and were going all out for a luxury experience with Rolls Royce transfer from Narita and the whole nine yards, but as the vacation drew closer we had some money constraints so wanted to cut back on the splurge to some extent.",2015-04-06
1,1717,5,I had seen this hotel from previous research and decided it was good enough given the cost was only about a third.,2015-04-06
1,1717,6,I booked a king jr suite as for whatever reason it was coming up cheaper than a regular king room (bonus) and I chose the non-guaranteed upgrade to executive (space permitting) and when checking in was given the upgrade.,2015-04-06

1,1717,9,Ride was long and interesting but the seats were soooo tiny.,2015-04-06
1,1717,10,Japanese bus seats were just not made for our North American fat butts!,2015-04-06

1,1717,12,"Room was bigger than we really needed, in fact we never used the couch area at all.",2015-04-06

1,1717,17,We woke stupidly early the next morning and decided to wander the area.,2015-04-06
1,1717,18,"We strolled down to Kabukicho which is where lots of the things we wanted to see were located (robot show, cat café, etc..).",2015-04-06
1,1717,19,It was a short 15-20 walk and we easily found the places we were looking for although they were still closed at that hour.,2015-04-06
1,1717,20,Found a Starbucks in the Shinjinku station and had fun watching the trains go by with workers faces smushed up against the glass as they were packed in like sardines.,2015-04-06
1,1717,21,We headed back to the hotel for breakfast (included with the executive upgrade) and thoroughly enjoyed the buffet.,2015-04-06
1,1717,22,It had enough of a variety that I had no complaints.,2015-04-06
1,1717,23,Service for coffee and such seemed prompt.,2015-04-06

1,1717,25,"While it appeared you could self-serve yourself, there were also wait staff who took drink requests and brought them to you.",2015-04-06
1,1717,26,The view was very nice from there and selection of drinks was more than adequate for our tastes.,2015-04-06
1,1717,27,They had nice snacks as well at times.,2015-04-06
1,1717,28,They had a shuttle to the train station but we just walked to/from as it really wasn't that far.,2015-04-06
1,1717,29,Perhaps the best thing I can say about the hotel happened near the end of our stay.,2015-04-06
1,1717,30,My wife and I had purchased some jewelry while on a tour the previous day in Asakusa (other side of town) at a store that only spoke japanese.,2015-04-06
1,1717,31,We discovered that the jewelry would not be allowed back into our country (Canada) as it was on a prohibited list so we wanted to return it.,2015-04-06
1,1717,32,"We explained our dilemma to the concierge and she contacted the store, explained the situation and arranged for us to return the item.",2015-04-06
1,1717,33,She gave the taxi driver instructions on where exactly we needed to go and upon getting to the store the clerk had our refund money ready for us in an envelope which he handed over after examining the item being returned.,2015-04-06
1,1717,34,It was a costly mistake for us as the taxi was expensive but it was far less than the cost of the jewelry and we absolutely could not have pulled off the return of it without the considerable help of the concierge.,2015-04-06
1,1717,35,Sadly the time we wasted on returning the jewelry ate up our last day of sightseeing before we had to scoot off to our cruise ship in Yokohama.,2015-04-06
1,1717,36,"I loved Japan so much, I've been itching to go back and we have finally decided to return next year.",2015-04-06
1,1717,37,I wanted to find a nice hotel that was a bit closer to the other areas we haven't seen yet so we could avoid using the trains as they are a bit daunting (at least Shinjuku station was) but after much research I find myself being drawn back to this hotel despite its location being less than ideal for us.,2015-04-06
1,1717,38,Simply the value is just too great.,2015-04-06
1,1717,39,Most of the nice hotels I can find where I'd feel comfortable are very expensive (like $600-$800 a night) whereas this hotel is about half that.,2015-04-06
1,1717,40,"When I was there, our friends who were cruising with us stayed at the Shangri'la Hotel (one of those $800/night places) and we went there to meet them one night for supper and I could say that I could tell it was classier for sure.",2015-04-06
1,1717,41,The staff bowed deeper and the service was a notch above too.,2015-04-06
1,1717,42,My friend left her MS medicine on the bus from the airport and she appealed to the concierge there for help.,2015-04-06
1,1717,43,"They called the company, located the bag and had it held for pickup, then one of the hotel staff ACCOMPANIED my friend in the taxi to ensure everything went smoothly.",2015-04-06
1,1717,44,"That is wow service, and certainly above and beyond what I would reasonably expect any hotel to do.",2015-04-06
1,1717,45,On the other hand this hotel (Hilton) provided adequate and helpful service for my own crisis and I paid $800 less than my friend for the same 2 nights.,2015-04-06
1,1717,46,My upcoming stay will be 3 nights.,2015-04-06

1,1779,1,"Being a Gold member of Hilton Hhonors and have been travelling extensively in the last couple of years, spending numerous nights in Hilton group hotels (ranging from New York, Sydney, Singapore, London, Macau, Beijing and Southern part of China), Hilton Tokyo is really a 5 star hotel that seldomly gave me the impression of slightly lack of warmth & hospitality for my stay, even this (in Feb 2015) was my repeated stay, since my first stay with Hilton Tokyo was just one year ago (in Jan 2014).",2015-02-28
1,1779,2,"It offered all the basic 5 star services and facilities and also tried to provide some value added services to business travellers ; but sadly enough, my stay was not for business, so i would expect the hotel staff would be greatly friendly and treated me & my travel partner with care ; unfortunately, i really can't feel the sense of belongings, nor distinguished services provided to me nor to my travel partner.",2015-02-28

1,1796,1,The Tokyo Hilton is conveniently located within walking distance to Shinjuku (20mins) and Harajuku (a little further) and close to two metro lines that can be reached by underground walkways.,2015-02-16
1,1796,2,It's a great luxurious hotel with all the amenities one would expect.,2015-02-16
1,1796,3,Entering the hotel for the first time I noticed just how busy it is in the lobby.,2015-02-16
1,1796,4,There are numerous check-in desks but still there seemed to be lots of people queuing.,2015-02-16

1,1796,9,The choice of food was good but the coffee was on the weak side.,2015-02-16

1,1797,1,We booked for an executive king room with booking.com and requested for smoking room.,2015-02-16
1,1797,2,"Upon check-in, we were told by front desk that there is no smoking room for the room type we booked.",2015-02-16
1,1797,3,We were told that the smoking rooms located only on 34th floor for double and executive junior suites were fully booked.,2015-02-16
1,1797,4,"Having no choice and not to cause a hassle to my husband who is a smoker, we need to opt for standard twin smoking room on 34th floor, i.e. there will be no refund on the amount we pay for the executive king room due to the non-existence room type as mentioned by the front desk.",2015-02-16
1,1797,5,We appreciate the front desk personnel for making an effort in making good of the situation but would like to suggest that specific room details should be made known to third party's agent rather than the guests having to take the stress upon check-in.,2015-02-16
1,1797,6,"We would also like to bring the attention of the door hanger where both sides showed ""Please Do Not Disturb"" instead of ""Clean Up Room"" on the other side.",2015-02-16

1,1800,5,"There is really nothing close to the hotel, although the main part of Shinjuku is walking distance away.",2015-02-11
1,1800,6,There are options on the metro nearby so the rest of Tokyo is accessible.,2015-02-11
1,1801,1,I stayed at this property simply because I am a Hilton Gold member.,2015-02-10
1,1801,2,"I usually don't mind even if I have to pay more at a Hilton property because I know that I will get room upgrades, or other benefits as a Gold member.",2015-02-10
1,1801,3,"But Hilton Tokyo doesn't provide any room upgrade and lounge access for Gold members, both of which are always granted at other Hilton properties without any problem.",2015-02-10
1,1801,4,"I am somewhat disappointed by this, and there is no reason to be loyalty to this hotel chain.",2015-02-10
1,1801,5,I will stay here in the future only if the rate is very competitive.,2015-02-10
1,1802,1,Being my first trip to Japan was daunting.,2015-02-10
1,1802,2,The staff at Hilton treated me in such a way that I felt secured and taken care of.,2015-02-10
1,1802,3,"They tried to inform me of anything I could possibly need which made it so that I did not have to worry about figuring out shuttle times, how to get around, and how to get the things that I needed.",2015-02-10
1,1802,4,I was very happy with my experience and will not consider going anywhere else when going to Japan.,2015-02-10
1,1802,5,The breakfast was also one the best hotel breakfasts I have ever had.,2015-02-10
1,1803,1,"Very quiet and confortable hotel, with excellent prestations .",2015-02-09
1,1803,2,Very convenient location close to Shinjuku Station and well deserved by the hotel shuttle.,2015-02-09
1,1803,3,Excellent for business purpose stay.,2015-02-09
1,1803,4,"Recommended as well for non-business stay, such for couples' romantic stay.",2015-02-09
1,1804,1,The location of this hotel is perfect for a visit to Tokyo as it's about a 10 minute walk to Shinjuku station and the heart of the entertainment district.,2015-02-08
1,1804,2,"The rooms were well appointed although, if you want a bathtub, you may need to request it as we were traveling with another couple and their room had one and ours didn't even though we had the same ""type"" of room.",2015-02-08
1,1804,3,"The bed was ok, if a bit on the hard side.",2015-02-08
1,1804,4,Don't bother with the restaurants in the hotel.,2015-02-08
1,1804,5,We ate at the Chinese one the night we arrived in Tokyo as we were exhausted and just wanted something quick to eat before we went to sleep.,2015-02-08
1,1804,6,The front desk recommended the restaurants in the hotel and the Chinese one was the only one that was even remotely reasonably priced (it was still about $60 pp without alcohol).,2015-02-08
1,1804,7,I don't mind spending money on a good meal but the prices at the restaurants in this hotel were straight up criminal for the quality of food.,2015-02-08
1,1804,8,It really wasn't anything special.,2015-02-08
1,1804,9,The service here was also a little iffy.,2015-02-08
1,1804,10,"I am definitely not one of those people who thinks that everyone in a foreign country should speak English but I will say that after two weeks in Japan, it was a bit surprising that the least proficient staff we encountered was at this hotel.",2015-02-08
1,1804,11,We asked to have our bags forwarded to our next hotel in Hakuba (something very commonly done in Japan) and even though we said that there was a similarly named hotel to the one we were staying at in the area and to be sure that the right hotel address was written down (I gave them the correct hotel name and address) they sent our luggage to the wrong hotel.,2015-02-08
1,1804,12,The concierge also told us it may take us two days to get to Nagano which is crazy considering the train ride is 90 minutes on the Shinkansen.,2015-02-08
1,1804,13,"I guess he was trying to account for bad weather but even so, you'd think if you're giving travel advice you'd want to be at least somewhat accurate (the weather forecast was fine for the day we were supposed to leave).",2015-02-08
1,1804,14,"Lastly, give yourself sufficient time to take the elevator down from your room.",2015-02-08
1,1804,15,Multiple times during our stay the elevators were too full to get on.,2015-02-08
1,1804,16,"Overall, I don't think this would be my first choice to stay for my next visit to Tokyo.",2015-02-08
1,1804,17,The location is great but the lapses in service and the issues with the elevators would me think twice about booking them again.,2015-02-08
1,1805,1,"Located in a very convenient location, and very nice.",2015-02-08
1,1805,2,Several good restaurants are in walking distance.,2015-02-08
1,1805,3,Also the shuttle to Shinjuku Station was a big help.,2015-02-08
1,1805,4,The staff was very helpful and kind.,2015-02-08
1,1805,5,"My only complaint was the room lacked free coffee, but that is more nit-picking than anything.",2015-02-08
1,1805,6,"I would recommend this place for anyone wanting an enjoyable, no-hassle, place to stay in Shinjuku (or Tokyo in general).",2015-02-08
1,1806,1,Booked on basis of location - ideally placed for station - and value for money as Toyko is expensive!,2015-02-08
1,1806,2,Rooms small but quiet and acceptable with comfortable bed.,2015-02-08
1,1806,3,"Bathroom tiny for two, but it was functional.",2015-02-08
1,1806,4,"Club lounge on top floor for breakfast and cocktail hour reasonable, with ok selection of hot snacks and canapes, good choice of drinks including champagne.",2015-02-08
1,1806,5,"Staff on the whole good, check in staff on ground floor bit officious, but I don't think they mean anything by it.",2015-02-08
1,1806,6,Concierge very helpful in sending off documents and directions.,2015-02-08
1,1806,7,Would stay again,2015-02-08
1,1807,1,"This is our forth day, two more nights and onto HK before returning home.",2015-02-07
1,1807,2,It's been sometime since I stayed at any Hilton hotel.,2015-02-07
1,1807,3,"In other countries, I've stayed at the Mandarin, Fourseasons and others.",2015-02-07
1,1807,4,My family want to thank all the executive lounge staff for making us feel so welcome!,2015-02-07
1,1807,5,We will definitely return and this will be our home in Tokyo!,2015-02-07

1,1809,2,Clean and spacious room with a great view.,2015-02-01
1,1809,3,Breakfast is being served in the Lobby Area which is not really convenient because of the hassle near the entrance.,2015-02-01
1,1809,4,Staff is friendly and helpful .,2015-02-01
1,1809,5,"Quality of W - Lan Connection in the room ( 1.700,- Y) is poor when using more than one device.",2015-02-01
1,1810,1,thanks again for the lovely stay !,2015-01-30
1,1810,2,and the opportunity to switch rooms the following day!,2015-01-30
1,1810,3,the staff took care of my luggage and delivered it to the new room promptly.,2015-01-30
1,1810,4,you can be very proud of your staff.,2015-01-30
1,1810,5,"i' m looking forward to the next layover and more ""food-expirience"" near your location.",2015-01-30
1,1810,6,within walking distance i dicover more and more gems to dine!,2015-01-30
1,1811,1,We wanted to upgrade to an executive room so we'd have a good view.,2015-01-29
1,1811,2,None of the executive rooms were available so we were put on the 20th floor.,2015-01-29
1,1811,3,The room was large and the view was ok.,2015-01-29
1,1811,4,Excellent breakfast buffet and free shuttle to the bus station.,2015-01-29
1,1811,5,We took the airport limo and it was good value for the money and time.,2015-01-29
1,1811,6,"I did, however, get bus sick on the way to the airport.",2015-01-29
1,1811,7,The Hilton is the last stop for the airport limo so there's not much choice for seats.,2015-01-29
1,1811,8,The Hilton was predictable and our only surprise was how unpredictable the concierge desk was.,2015-01-29
1,1811,9,Several of the staff seemed to dislike their job and our questions irritated them.,2015-01-29
1,1811,10,After the excellent service in Kyoto at the Granvia Hotel we were unpleasantly surprised by Hilton.,2015-01-29
1,1812,1,The location is impeccable.,2015-01-28
1,1812,2,The free hotel shuttle to Shinjuku station is very helpful.,2015-01-28
1,1812,3,Check in and door staff were excellent.,2015-01-28
1,1812,4,Breakfast was sumptous.,2015-01-28
1,1812,5,Rooms were very decent sized for Tokyo and the hotel very well maintained.,2015-01-28
1,1812,6,So why the but...,2015-01-28
1,1812,7,On the day of departure there was a really dour looking lady working on the computer at the concierge when we approached her to pass her our tickets for the airport express.,2015-01-28
1,1812,8,She wasn't very approachable at all.,2015-01-28
1,1812,9,Maybe she wasn't a staff of the concierge.,2015-01-28
1,1812,10,"Luckily for us, another much nicer staff approached us very quickly and helped us instead.",2015-01-28
1,1812,11,"This is unpleasant staff, of course, is highly atypical of Hilton, or for that matter, any staff working in Japan.",2015-01-28
1,1812,12,So sometimes a small unpleasant experience can affect the whole impression of an otherwise really good place.,2015-01-28
1,1813,1,"Great location with the direct availability of the Airport Limosine Bus. From the hotel, it is easy to travel within Tokyo as there is a direct Metro station from the basement and the free shuttle bus to ShinJuku Station.",2015-01-27
1,1813,2,Nice view of you get the top floors and the size of the rooms are pretty decent.,2015-01-27
1,1813,3,My only negative experience was the Concierge Desk who were not too friendly and doesn't seem keen to provide services to others.,2015-01-27
1,1813,4,This is in total contrast to the check-in desks who are prompt and professional with their services which is a kudos to the hotel.,2015-01-27
1,1814,1,Firstly the cons:,2015-01-27
1,1814,2,The lobby are constantly packed with people from guests to visitors.,2015-01-27
1,1814,3,The hotel clearly cater more towards tour packages from china and taiwan.,2015-01-27
1,1814,4,I have also seen airline staff from singapore airlines and another european airline(I think it is lufthansa).,2015-01-27
1,1814,5,Can't really say much about the service as I have received none.,2015-01-27
1,1814,6,I had some china tourist who tried jumping the queue which annoyed me.,2015-01-27
1,1814,7,Their constant shouting in the lobby irks me as well.,2015-01-27
1,1814,8,"Now to the good stuff,",2015-01-27
1,1814,9,The room is beautiful and well renovated.,2015-01-27
1,1814,10,We had the King jnr suite which is easily well worth the slight premium.,2015-01-27

1,1818,3,"On arrival, we booked in and were shown to our rooms on the 32nd floor.",2015-01-27
1,1818,4,"Yes, the room was bigger and the bed very very comfy, we were surprised by the distinct lack of WiFi in our room and the lack of complimentary items.",2015-01-27
1,1818,5,"In the other places we have stayed-these are standard-even in the capsule hotels, WiFi is complimentary!!!",2015-01-27

1,1818,8,Everything in this hotel is incredibly expensive and is no better than anywhere else we stayed.,2015-01-27
1,1818,9,"Whilst I understand The Hilton has a good reputation and basically rides on its name, we felt the hotel needed massive updating, better facilities and to be honest rethink your ridiculous pricing!",2015-01-27
1,1818,10,"We also found that whilst your front of house spoke good English, the rest of the staff didn't and we found that a problem when the kettle broke in our room.",2015-01-27

1,1825,7,I had the hotel arrange a private taxi with English speaking driver for me to tour rather than go on group tour.,2015-01-18
1,1825,8,It is much more expensive than bus tour but worth every dollar!,2015-01-18
1,1825,9,I had the car for 9 hours and saw everything I wanted and more.,2015-01-18
1,1825,10,Didn't feel rushed and the driver offered to take me other places which was great.,2015-01-18
1,1825,11,If you're not on a budget I suggest hiring a taxi.,2015-01-18
1,1825,12,The only concern I had with the hotel was the cost of food.,2015-01-18

1,1825,16,No this was not room service...,2015-01-18
1,1825,17,This was in the lounge on first floor.,2015-01-18
1,1825,18,I don't mind paying for a good meal but this was expensive and to top it off it was not good.,2015-01-18

1,1825,20,pizza...,2015-01-18
1,1825,21,and she said it was also pricey and not that great.,2015-01-18

1,1825,23,Overall I wish I could give a 4.5...,2015-01-18
1,1825,24,I would definitely stay there again.,2015-01-18

1,1826,2,Just beautiful rooms.,2015-01-18
1,1826,3,Breakfast buffet is expensive but is amazing.,2015-01-18
1,1826,4,"If buffet is not included in your rate, it gets a bit confusing for the staff as each morning we had to ask for the bill and had to stress that we only had the continental breakfast.",2015-01-18
1,1826,5,But loved the staff and the feel of the place.,2015-01-18
1,1826,6,I do hope we can stay here again.,2015-01-18
1,1826,7,Very close to the Shinjuku train station.,2015-01-18
1,1826,8,The Japanese bath in the fitness center was definitely a different cultural experience!,2015-01-18
1,1827,1,"have just finished a three night stay at Tokyo Hilton, overall still impressive but breakfast size and variety reduced since last stay and check in and out still very, very slow, need to address this.",2015-01-17
1,1827,2,"Rooms ok, not 100% sold on new decor but just my option",2015-01-17
1,1828,1,I stay at the Hilton family of hotels a lot - this one is very nice!,2015-01-15
1,1828,2,We had 2 nights in Tokyo and found this location to be great for what we were doing.,2015-01-15
1,1828,3,They are within walking distance from the Shinjuku station but it was very easy to take the Hilton shuttle which runs every 20 minutes.,2015-01-15

1,1829,3,I look forward to coming back!,2015-01-15
1,1829,4,I particularly enjoyed the gym and spa.,2015-01-15
1,1829,5,The service was great.,2015-01-15

1,1829,8,"I'm sure that will be great, too.",2015-01-15
1,1829,9,"I totally recommend this hotel for business or holiday, just leave your children at home.",2015-01-15
1,1830,1,We arrived via the Hilton courtesy bus from Shinjuku station.,2015-01-14
1,1830,2,Our suitcases were taken from us and we were deposited into a lift to the 37th floor to check-in in the executive lounge.,2015-01-14
1,1830,3,Our greeting at the lounge was warm and genuine and we were invited to sit on a sofa during the formalities.,2015-01-14
1,1830,4,Our e-standby upgrade request was honoured and thus room changed from my booked Executive Double to a Junior Executive Suite - and at a very reasonable cost too.,2015-01-14
1,1830,5,"It was now 10:00, 4 hours before the earliest check-in, yet to our enormous gratitude we were invited to check into our room immediately.",2015-01-14
1,1830,6,"I was aware that a package had been left at the hotel reception for me the previous day, from my Mum, who was a guest at another local hotel.",2015-01-14
1,1830,7,The package was delivered - without any prompting from me - moments after we checked in.,2015-01-14
1,1830,8,We had occasion to visit the Executive lounge several times during our 4 night stay.,2015-01-14
1,1830,9,Each time we were greeted warmly and remembered by the staff (which was appreciated as it avoided us ever having to 'prove' our status by showing the room key sleeve).,2015-01-14
1,1830,10,"To me, the above demonstrates perfect attention to detail by the team there.",2015-01-14
1,1830,11,"Despite being young and casually dressed (this was a holiday, not business), we were treated equally as well as all other patrons.",2015-01-14
1,1830,12,"I cannot speak highly enough of the service provided by the entire Exec lounge staff, absolutely flawless, pre-emptive, and courteous.",2015-01-14
1,1830,13,Our Junior Suite prompted mixed feelings.,2015-01-14
1,1830,14,"The space was fantastic, particularly by Tokyo standards, and the decor modern and minimalist.",2015-01-14
1,1830,15,"We appreciated the Nespresso machine, iPhone dock and the free wi-fi.",2015-01-14
1,1830,16,"Although the wi-fi worked well, I thought it odd that it only allowed us to connect three devices for free, though to the hotels credit, this problem was fixed immediately by a call to guest services who provided me with a complimentary pass-code for more devices (as a couple we carry a mobile phone each, a work mobile each, an ipad each and potentially a laptop each...",2015-01-14
1,1830,17,"this is fairly standard I expect, so a limit of three devices is baffling).",2015-01-14
1,1830,18,"My constructive feedback on the suite, however, is that the bathroom is shamefully small in a room of that size.",2015-01-14
1,1830,19,"To give you an idea of how small I mean, it is no exaggeration to tell you that unless you are rather slim you will not be able to open the shower door if the bathroom door is closed.",2015-01-14
1,1830,20,Once inside the shower cubicle you find it is 'wet room' style.,2015-01-14
1,1830,21,"A nice idea, and it looks great, but the determination to squeeze both a bathtub and a shower area in results in a bathtub that is too small to relax in, and a shower whose water flow mostly falls inside the bathtub rather than the shower pan.",2015-01-14
1,1830,22,A really poor design which is frustrating to use and defines the phrase 'style over substance'!,2015-01-14
1,1830,23,"Back to the positives, and I'm pleased to say the bed was huge and comfortable, and despite our ultra-last minute room change at check in, our pre-ordered pillow menu requests still reached the new room before we did - kudos to the excellent housekeeping team.",2015-01-14
1,1830,24,Breakfast was very nice.,2015-01-14
1,1830,25,We chose to dine in the Marble lounge each morning so cannot comment on the light breakfast served in the Exec lounge.,2015-01-14
1,1830,26,"Although the choice of both Western and Eastern breakfasts was fairly extensive, it did not change at all during our 4 mornings there.",2015-01-14
1,1830,27,What was exciting on morning one became dull by morning 4.,2015-01-14
1,1830,28,"The wait staff, whilst lovely, are painfully slow to serve coffee - which I notice has been picked up by previous reviewers - and is perhaps an area for the restaurant management to focus on, and the only English newspaper available is the FT - which is perhaps a tad heavy going whilst on holiday!",2015-01-14
1,1830,29,"Besides that, the restaurant itself is beautifully appointed and very comfortable.",2015-01-14
1,1830,30,"Overall, this was an excellent experience.",2015-01-14
1,1830,31,"We would not hesitate to return, and indeed I am sure we will.",2015-01-14
1,1830,32,"With the possible exception of one stern, grumpy egg chef, each and every other staff member we encountered is an absolute credit to the hotel, and made our stay unforgettable for all the right reasons.",2015-01-14
1,1830,33,Thank you Hilton for a great stay.,2015-01-14
1,1831,1,"Other than the great rate I get, the Hilton is still my favorite hotel in Tokyo.",2015-01-12
1,1831,2,The new refurbished rooms are nice and stylish.,2015-01-12
1,1831,3,"Though the size of the room is not the best, the new rooms are great and really makes the experience different and refreshing.",2015-01-12
1,1831,4,"The lounge team recognizes how busy things can be and reserved another room for Diamond members, which is a nice touch.",2015-01-12
1,1831,5,Service in Japan is always great and no different here at the Hilton.,2015-01-12
1,1831,6,Location is walking distance from Nishi-Shinjuku station and there is the shuttle to Shinjuku station so it is just simply convenient.,2015-01-12
1,1832,1,"Stays for business for several night as was impressed with the quality of the room, service and food.",2015-01-12
1,1832,2,"Only real gripe was that its expensive but, that is most often the case with Tokyo hotels.",2015-01-12
1,1832,3,"Location is great right near the centre of Shinjuku which was convenient for both business, dining and shopping needs.",2015-01-12
1,1832,4,Would definitely consider staying here again when in Tokyo.,2015-01-12
1,1833,1,I chose this hotel for its room design which was modern and clean looking on the hotel website.,2015-01-11
1,1833,2,"Actually the refurbishment was quite old, so my room was ever so slightly run down.",2015-01-11
1,1833,3,The staff were very helpful and helped me change rooms three times owing to noise from elevators.,2015-01-11
1,1833,4,I would suggest the soundproofing is not very good by modern standards as I could always hear people walking on the floor above my room.,2015-01-11
1,1833,5,"The location is good, just 10 minutes walk into the station.",2015-01-11
1,1833,6,There is a small mall under the hotel with some good places to eat if you don't want to go far.,2015-01-11
1,1833,7,This is vital as room service is massively expensive and over priced.,2015-01-11
1,1833,8,I find it a bit sad that a once great brand like Hilton charges for wifi and drinking water in its rooms.,2015-01-11
1,1833,9,"There is free wifi in the lobby, but the lobby has only two sofas and two chairs, so it's more likely you will leave the hotel for wifi and food.",2015-01-11
1,1834,1,I recently stayed at this property with my family of six during the Christmas holiday.,2015-01-10
1,1834,2,We chose the Hilton based upon the many positive reviews from fellow travelers.,2015-01-10
1,1834,3,We were not disappointed.,2015-01-10
1,1834,4,Getting to the hotel was very easy from the Tokyo Hanaeda Airport.,2015-01-10
1,1834,5,There was the airport limousine service that provided route bus transportation to the Shinjuku area hotels.,2015-01-10
1,1834,6,"For the price of 1800 yen we had transport fare and a one day pass for the metro system, worth 1000 yen.",2015-01-10
1,1834,7,The airport bus went directly to the Shinjuku bus station area as well as to the front door of the Hilton.,2015-01-10
1,1834,8,We were greeted immediately by the hotel staff who took our bags and escorted us directly to the check in counter.,2015-01-10
1,1834,9,The process was quick and effortless.,2015-01-10
1,1834,10,We arrived in the early morning with regular check in time at 2 pm.,2015-01-10
1,1834,11,"They were able to prepare a room early to place our bags a head of check in time, arrange all three rooms on the same floor, and get us oriented to spend some time exploring the Shinjuku area in short order.",2015-01-10
1,1834,12,"One of our rooms on the west wing, north facing offered a great view of the city and Mt. Fuji!",2015-01-10
1,1834,13,"The hotel also had a regular shuttle that ran to the Keio Plaza hotel area and bus station area, which could also be easily walked to.",2015-01-10
1,1834,14,If you plan to use the shuttle keep in mind it usually filled quickly.,2015-01-10
1,1834,15,The closest Metro station is the Tochomae Station (E 28) for the Marunouchi Line and Oedo Line that was reachable through the underground shopping complex and walkways that network the area.,2015-01-10
1,1834,16,Above ground and underground walkways also connected you to the neighboring Tokyo Metropolitan Government buildings and to the Shinjuku Metro and Japan Rail station.,2015-01-10
1,1834,17,"Although it is a little disorienting trying to figure out directions underground and above grounds, all streets and signs were in both Japanese and English and easily navigated.",2015-01-10
1,1834,18,"For those using the Metro subway lines, most fares were between 170 to 220 yen getting from here to other points of interest around Tokyo.",2015-01-10
1,1834,19,"For those with the Japan Rail Pass, you have access to the Chuo Line, Yamanote, Tokaido, and Tsurumi line that you can use for local travel as easily as the metro line from the Shinjuku Station, which was about a 15 minute walk through the Shinjuku food and shopping neighborhood.",2015-01-10
1,1834,20,"Keep in mind that when using your Japan Rail Pass, you enter and exit stations through the staffed booths rather than the automated gates.",2015-01-10
1,1834,21,The hotel was overall in a great area to access the restaurant and shopping areas of Shinjuku.,2015-01-10
1,1834,22,It is walkable to the Shinjuku Gyoen Park about 20 minutes away and near major shopping destinations.,2015-01-10
1,1834,23,They offer a buffet breakfast for 2100 yen and fine dining.,2015-01-10
1,1834,24,"The underground shops of Hiltopia had some dining opportunities, but there were many more in the surrounding neighborhood.",2015-01-10
1,1834,25,We did have a nice Indian food meal at the Ashoka Shinjuku which was a nice change from the Japanese cuisine.,2015-01-10
1,1834,26,"Overall, we had a very comfortable stay at the Hilton and found it well located for our travel needs.",2015-01-10
1,1835,1,"Very helpful staff, yet some were a little bit amateurish.",2015-01-10

1,1918,2,"Some great staff, particularly in the Executive Lounge.",2014-11-07

1,1919,7,The location is in the 'skyscraper district' a 10 minute leisurely walk at most from the crazy and endless Shinjuku station.,2014-11-06
1,1919,8,We always try to stay near the station given the junction of so many train lines and the Yamanote Ring line.,2014-11-06
1,1919,9,It really becomes quite convenient.,2014-11-06
1,1919,10,"The fitness center is complete with spa facilities, that I did not use, but the gym was Hilton worthy with a very nice pool.",2014-11-06

1,1920,3,Hilton have made an effort over the years to have great breakfasts and the Tokyo Hilton is no exception.,2014-11-06
1,1920,4,The gym is small but well appointed; the pool is wonderful (and no charge which is unusual for Japan).,2014-11-06
1,1920,5,"For those not used to the Japanese Sento or public bath experience, then the small one in the pool area is a great start.",2014-11-06
1,1920,6,Downside is location.,2014-11-06
1,1920,7,The hotel shuttle is 3 times an hour to Shinjuku.,2014-11-06
1,1920,8,The only sightseeing in the immediate area is the Tokyo Metropolitan Government (which is well worth it - meet a free English guide in the reception).,2014-11-06
1,1920,9,There are Tokyo Metro trains attached to the hotel but the underground walk must be 1 km.,2014-11-06
1,1920,10,I would stay there again but consider other options.,2014-11-06
1,1921,1,We were very pleased because we were on one of the executive floors and could take advantage of the freshly squeezed orange juice in the mornings and the amazing spread with drinks late afternoon.,2014-11-06
1,1921,2,"The location isn't great, and we had a hard time getting everything from our suitcases that we needed for five days into the little spaces provided.",2014-11-06
1,1921,3,"The bed is comfortable, but the pillows are way too large.",2014-11-06
1,1921,4,There seems to be a lot of businessmen and business women staying here.,2014-11-06
1,1921,5,The mornings is like grand central station with flags and bus loads of people checking out and going on tour.,2014-11-06
1,1921,6,"I will have to say that a bus is provided every 20 minutes from the hotel to a central location, where you can shop, walk or take the subway.",2014-11-06
1,1922,1,Stayed here for 4 nights altogether when I visited Tokyo.,2014-11-05
1,1922,2,"The renovated king deluxe room that I stayed in was excellent: clean, modern, spacious by Japanese standard, a nice touch of Japanese culture with the paper windows.",2014-11-05

1,1922,4,Check in was smooth and efficient.,2014-11-05
1,1922,5,The luggage delivery service downstairs near the concierge was also something I was really impressed with.,2014-11-05
1,1922,6,we sent our 20kgs luggage through Hilton to the hotel in Kyoto for 2000 yen.,2014-11-05
1,1922,7,The most well spent 2000 yen ever saving us the hassle of dragging the luggages everywhere.,2014-11-05
1,1922,8,"Location wise, it's not the best location as it's located in west shinjuku, about 30 mins walk from shinjuku station and 10 mins walk from nishishinjuku station.",2014-11-05
1,1922,9,"For me it's ok as I didn't have tight schedule, but for other people with massive luggages and need to get around much it could be quite a hassle, especially during peak hour or on a rainy day.",2014-11-05
1,1922,10,However they do have the shuttle service to and fro shinjuku station if you don't like too much walking.,2014-11-05
1,1922,11,A slight dissatisfaction from me would be the absence of free drinking bottled water.,2014-11-05
1,1922,12,Not sure if it's because of the fact that I booked through a third party agent or it's just the norm of this hotel.,2014-11-05
1,1922,13,"All in all, it's still the luxurious Hilton hotel that we have always known.",2014-11-05
1,1922,14,Will definitely stay here again the next time I am here.,2014-11-05
1,1923,1,Spent a total of 7 nights at Hilton Tokyo in October.,2014-11-05
1,1923,2,It was a great stay.,2014-11-05
1,1923,3,Had a room upgrade via Hilton Hhonors hence had access to the lounge.,2014-11-05
1,1923,4,Internet was also bundled in.,2014-11-05
1,1923,5,Otherwise I would be rather irritated to have to pay for internet in the room so might want to take note of this if access is important.,2014-11-05
1,1923,6,The hotel is located between two metro lines.,2014-11-05
1,1923,7,I used mainly the metros and the free shuttle (love the shuttle) It is not as punctual as transport usually is in Japan but it does not bother me.,2014-11-05
1,1923,8,The travellators that lead to the metro station are not in operation.,2014-11-05
1,1923,9,I am not sure if its this way all year round.,2014-11-05
1,1923,10,"So although the hotel is not located right in the hub of touristy things, it is easy to get to Shinjuku or any other part of central Tokyo.",2014-11-05
1,1923,11,The room itself was great.,2014-11-05
1,1923,12,Beds were comfortable.,2014-11-05
1,1923,13,They were also generous with toiletries.,2014-11-05
1,1923,14,Lastly I wish to lavish great praise on their concierge service.,2014-11-05
1,1923,15,They helped with restaurant reservations/directions and could speak impeccable english.,2014-11-05
1,1923,16,In fact you can email them for assistance from the time you confirm your reservation for all your needs and requests.,2014-11-05
1,1923,17,Also the hotel drop off is one of the stops for the airport limo bus from Haneda and Narita which makes it very convenient.,2014-11-05
1,1923,18,A very good stay.,2014-11-05
1,1923,19,Will be heading back again next week for a shorter stay.,2014-11-05
1,1923,20,Looking forward.,2014-11-05
1,1924,1,"Great hotel in best location in Tokyo, walking distance to just about everything.",2014-11-05
1,1924,2,"All amenities are there for your comfort, Breakfasts and dinners in the Marble Room downstairs become very boring after the first 2 nights, very western influence it would have been nice to sample the Japanese culture a little more in the buffet options.",2014-11-05
1,1924,3,We will stay there again if traveling to Japan.,2014-11-05
1,1925,1,"This is a nice hotel, well-decorated and lots of facilities.",2014-11-03
1,1925,2,"The location isn't great, I think it's more for business travellers visiting local companies: it's on a couple of transit lines which will get you anywhere in Tokyo, but there's nothing really close by (except for a bit of Shinjuku's bright lights, 10/15 minutes walk away).",2014-11-03
1,1925,3,"I would say it's over-priced for what you get, especially since everything has an extra charge, e.g. wi-fi and water, so only book if you get a good deal.",2014-11-03
1,1925,4,"I stayed for $100/night with a corporate account, which is excellent value for Tokyo.",2014-11-03
1,1925,5,I would say up to $150 is reasonable for this place.,2014-11-03
1,1926,1,We stayed in this hotel with two children aged 4 and 7.,2014-11-03
1,1926,2,We upgraded to an executive floor and had the most amazing family room with spectacular views across the city.,2014-11-03
1,1926,3,Very spacious and comfortable with excellent facilities.,2014-11-03
1,1926,4,I loved the glass bathroom!,2014-11-03
1,1926,5,Like all Japanese hotels I have stayed in there was no need for toiletries as they were provided including razors and toothbrush.,2014-11-03
1,1926,6,A nightgown was also provided.,2014-11-03
1,1926,7,The beds were extremely comfotable and the air on in the room well controlled.,2014-11-03

1,1926,9,The children had a particular liking for the chocolate milk.,2014-11-03
1,1926,10,We were also able to borrow DVDs to watch in our room through our access to this lounge.,2014-11-03
1,1926,11,We were so pleased that we had upgraded.,2014-11-03
1,1926,12,The staff were so helpful and even booked a Karaoke for us and wrote down the details in Japanese for us to hand in when we arrived there.,2014-11-03
1,1926,13,We preferred breakfast in here to the restaurant.,2014-11-03
1,1926,14,The location was ideal for public transport with a metro station under the hotel.,2014-11-03
1,1926,15,The hotel provided a bus every 20 minutes to Shinjuku station which was just over a 5 minute journey.,2014-11-03
1,1926,16,"In Shinjuku we we visited the Robot Restaurant (good fun), karaoke and an amazing BBQ restaurant.",2014-11-03
1,1926,17,We used the metro to travel to Yoyogi Park and The Skytree.,2014-11-03
1,1926,18,I would love to stay here again!,2014-11-03
1,1927,1,Excellent modern hotel with fantastic amenities close to Metro (hotel connected via tunnel to Nishishinjuku Station on the Marunouchi Line) and within walking distance of Shinjuku Station.,2014-11-03
1,1927,2,Complementary shuttle to/from Shinjuku station offered as well.,2014-11-03

1,1971,2,"Seriously, this manager goes so far to treat guests like they are visiting royalty that you actually start to believe it lol Upon arrival, we were greeted by 2 managers and 2 bell hops ?",2014-10-03
1,1971,3,Our luggage was taken to our room and we were offered a light snack due to very late night arrival which we declined although it was a lovely gesture.,2014-10-03
1,1971,4,We had been upgraded at no extra charge and an apology was given for the upgrade-unintentionally funny.,2014-10-03

1,1971,6,The buffet breakfasts were exceptional with an incredible variety of foods on offer.,2014-10-03
1,1971,7,Sunrise Tours picks up tourists directly from the Tokyo Hilton and the Airport Limousine bus drops off and picks up directly from the Tokyo Hilton.,2014-10-03
1,1971,8,The rail system is rather confusing however the hotel makes a point of giving you a card written in Japanese so you can ask people for help when you become a little lost.,2014-10-03
1,1971,9,We stayed for 6 nights and would definitely like to return at some point in the future.,2014-10-03

1,1972,1,We stayed at Hilton Tokyo Bay for 5 nights and Hilton Tokyo for one night in September in a Junior Suite.,2014-10-03
1,1972,2,"Having been highly impressed with the Hilton Tokyo Bay, we were dissapointed with Hilton Tokyo.",2014-10-03
1,1972,3,"Service was impersonal, no acknowledgement of Hilton Gold Honours membership (through dedicated check-in or breakfast queues), slow and long lines at check-in, inconvenient location meaning you had to rely on the shuttle bus to get to Shinjuku Station which was always crowded and meant you had to line up at least 15 mins earlier to get on the bus and the beds were too hard (I woke up with a sore back!).",2014-10-03
1,1973,1,We stayed for 2 nights at this hotel and got an upgrade to the executive floor.,2014-10-01
1,1973,2,"The service at this hotel was absolutely flawless, and easily the best we have encountered.",2014-10-01
1,1973,3,"All the staff were super accommodating, helpful, and friendly.",2014-10-01
1,1973,4,The hotel is close to the Tokyo Metropolitan Bldg and not walkable from Shinjuku station.,2014-10-01
1,1973,5,You have to take the Marunouchi subway and get off at the Nishi Shinjuku station and walk a couple of minutes from there to the hotel.,2014-10-01
1,1973,6,"However, the hotel has a shuttle bus to Shinjuku station, which is super convenient (the cab ride from the hotel to Shinjuku station costs 730 yen).",2014-10-01
1,1973,7,"The shuttle departs from the hotel three times every hour (12, 32, and 52 minutes past the hour) and run until 9 pm.",2014-10-01
1,1973,8,"It also picks up from the west exit of the Shinjuku station three times per hour (00, 20, and 40 minutes past the hour).",2014-10-01
1,1973,9,The breakfast spread at the hotel is a typical continental breakfast with some Japanese selection.,2014-10-01

1,1973,11,"The room was very comfortable, clean, big (for Tokyo), and had a great view.",2014-10-01
1,1973,12,Would love to come back again!!,2014-10-01
1,1974,1,I had been monitoring the reviews of this hotel for months prior to visit with them and now it's time for me to weigh in myself as I have quite a story to tell.,2014-10-01
1,1974,2,"My wife and I stayed at this property for 3 nights, 4 days at the end of September.",2014-10-01
1,1974,3,"We had booked an advanced reservation for 2 nights, 3 days initially, but we ended up extending our stay which required an additional reservation for the extra night.",2014-10-01
1,1974,4,"For both reservations, we chose to put in requests for eStandby upgrades, which some of the readers might be familiar with.",2014-10-01
1,1974,5,"In any case, when we arrived at the hotel for check-in, we were informed that we had been upgraded from our King Jr. Executive suite to the King Tower Suite.",2014-10-01
1,1974,6,So far so good.,2014-10-01
1,1974,7,"So when we asked about how the Executive lounge and free Wi-Fi worked, we were told that this was not an Executive level package.",2014-10-01
1,1974,8,I asked the gentleman to re-check the reservation as I was certain that we had booked an Executive level suite.,2014-10-01
1,1974,9,"He did so, but again re-stated that this was not an Executive suite.",2014-10-01
1,1974,10,"At this point, I said that we were going to decline the room upgrade in that case and go with our original reservation, which I knew to be Executive-level.",2014-10-01
1,1974,11,"He said that, unfortunately, there were no rooms available for our original reservation and that we would have to take the ""upgraded"" room.",2014-10-01
1,1974,12,No mention was ever made about the fact that I had chosen numerous eStandby upgrades but was never given the choice of any.,2014-10-01
1,1974,13,"At this point, I was feeling fatigued from a long Shinkansen ride from Kyoto and I didn't have the strength to argue any further (plus it seemed like a very inappropriate thing to do in Japan), plus I wanted to double-check my reservation details privately to ensure that I hadn't made a mistake.",2014-10-01
1,1974,14,They did offer me a slight discount on Wi-Fi and breakfast that I reluctantly took.,2014-10-01
1,1974,15,"Once we got to the suite, I found myself quite impressed with it despite being rather upset about check-in.",2014-10-01
1,1974,16,So I immediately setup my laptop and starting looking into what had happened with my reservation.,2014-10-01
1,1974,17,"Strangely, when I looked up my original reservation, I could only see the confirmation number but it would not allow me to view the details of the reservation (I had done so numerous times in the past without problem which is why it was so strange); the details of the second reservation came up fine though.",2014-10-01
1,1974,18,"After reviewing what I could, I was no closer to an answer than when I started, so I found myself looking at the desk which had a generalized letter welcoming us to the Hilton and at the end of the letter it stated to contact them about any issues that might make our trip better.",2014-10-01
1,1974,19,"At this point, I realized that this was going to be a sour part of our trip unless I spoke out about it, plus I remembered reading replies from the hotel on this very message board where they stated that they wished people would've contacted them about issues when they still had a chance to make it right for them.",2014-10-01
1,1974,20,So I wrote up a relatively long email explaining the issues I had encountered at check-in and just decided to leave it in their hands while we went out to run some errands.,2014-10-01
1,1974,21,"Once we returned, we noticed a letter under the door.",2014-10-01
1,1974,22,"As we took it into the room, we further noticed a fruit arrangement on the table as well.",2014-10-01
1,1974,23,The letter was the welcome letter to the Executive level that we assumed each member receives at check-in.,2014-10-01
1,1974,24,"No other messages were left, so I figured that they had replied to my e-mail.",2014-10-01
1,1974,25,"Sure enough, when I booted up my laptop, I had a lengthy response from the Reception Manager.",2014-10-01
1,1974,26,He deeply apologized for the issues we encountered at check-in and assured us that this was not representative of the service normally offered by the Hilton.,2014-10-01
1,1974,27,"He further stated that he had pulled our records for eStandby and found that of the 3 requested upgrades we selected, 2 of them were for Executive level, and the one that was not, was the one that was given to us.",2014-10-01
1,1974,28,"Apparently, this was incorrect as alternatives should have been made available to us, but weren't.",2014-10-01
1,1974,29,"In any case, the hotel waived the room upgrade charges for the remaining days, cleared the bill of breakfast/Wi-Fi charges as we were Executive now, and offered us discounts on hotel services such as laundry.",2014-10-01
1,1974,30,We were in awe of such service as nothing like this has EVER been offered to us in the past at any hotel chain.,2014-10-01
1,1974,31,"2 nights later, the hotel also formally recognized my wife's birthday with some goodies that were a total surprise.",2014-10-01
1,1974,32,"No one likes to have issues with checking into a hotel; however, I am sure glad that I spoke up about it because I truly believe that the Hilton Tokyo hotel more than made up for the issues we encountered.",2014-10-01
1,1974,33,"Even before we checked into the hotel, we were already experiencing their wonderful hospitality thanks to a member of their Concierge team by the name of Ayako Nakamura.",2014-10-01
1,1974,34,Nakamura-san had arranged for some professional photos that we took in Kyoto to be shipped to the hotel and then later forwarded to our US address when it was discovered that the photo studio could not ship the finished hardcover book to the US directly.,2014-10-01
1,1974,35,"This kind of customer service was inspiring and served as a reminder just how different hotels in the US are compared to those in Japan, where people bend over backwards to help out complete strangers everyday.",2014-10-01
1,1974,36,"Finally, I must thank Mr. Fan and Mr. Ogura for helping us work through our issues and providing us with an experience that we are still frankly in awe of.",2014-10-01
1,1974,37,We feel as though we made friends in the both of you and hope to see you during a future visit.,2014-10-01
1,1974,38,"For the readers who managed to make it this far, Hilton Tokyo is the real deal.",2014-10-01
1,1974,39,"It is a clean, modern hotel that has an amazing staff that is literally waiting to help make your stay better in any way that they can.",2014-10-01
1,1974,40,"If you can learn one thing from my experience, I would hope that it is to speak up about issues that the hotel can help you with.",2014-10-01
1,1974,41,"Don't just run to TripAdvisor or any other site to bash the hotel, but instead, I would encourage you to give them the opportunity to fix the problem as they did for us.",2014-10-01
1,1974,42,We can't wait to stay at Hilton Tokyo again!,2014-10-01

1,1975,10,"All in all, I would stay there again.",2014-09-30
1,1976,1,Located more in the CBD area of Shinjuku its about a 15min walk to the main train station of Shinjuku and the shopping area.However theres a subway station about 5mins walk away and is connected by an underground walkway from next to the hotel`s shuttle bus stop.Hotel shuttle bus runs every 20mins from morning to night stopping at the Odakyu Department store next to the airport limousine..Right next door to the hotel is a hospital and very tall office blocks in the surrounding vicinity.Behind is a big park and opposite is the Hyatt Hotel.There is a Dennys behind and a few more restaurants on the way to Shinjuku station.,2014-09-28
1,1976,2,The airport limousine bus from Haneda and Narita drops and picks passengers up from the hotel so its easy access to both airports.Tickets can be bought at the Concierge.Bags unloaded from the bus by the porters but no assistance offered to transport your bags to the reception or room..Cozy average size lobby with the lobby cafe to the right as you enter.Checkin swift and polite and typical Japanese businesslike efficency.,2014-09-28
1,1976,3,Rooms have been renovated so its very new bright and clean.Decor is modern black white and beige.The twin beds that i had were one of the smallest beds i have ever slept in a hotel.I just barely fit into them.Size of room is average with all the usual amenities provided.Theres a red lounger that immediately catches your eyes as you enter because its such a contrast to the decor of the room.,2014-09-28
1,1976,4,Toilet again is brand spanking new so you can see and feel how clean and shiny everything is.Like all other Hiltons...you are supplied with nice Peter Thomas Roth toiletries.,2014-09-28
1,1976,5,Internet as usual is chargeable at 1700yen a day but is free in the lobby.Remember this is Japan so everything is expensive.If you decide to have breakfast in bed it will cost you a whopping 3500yen for an american breakfast..which doesnt include taxes.The only good thing is you dont have to worry about how much to tip as there is no tipping.,2014-09-28

1,1982,1,Location is one of the best while I did not expect a big convenience in terms of the transportation access.,2014-09-25
1,1982,2,The place used to be nowhere near to get trains without 15 minutes walk at least.,2014-09-25
1,1982,3,Now I figured that there are couple of choices to get subway on top of taxi and limo.,2014-09-25

1,1989,9,"Great hotel, great city...already looking forward to the next visit.",2014-09-16
1,1990,1,Stayed here last month.,2014-09-16
1,1990,2,"During check-in, requested for late check-out due to late afternoon flight the next day, and was delighted to have been offered an upgrade to executive room as HH Gold.",2014-09-16
1,1990,3,"However, I was a bit disappointed that the hotel card keys didn't work twice consecutively.",2014-09-16
1,1990,4,Went to the front desk for assistance and was satisfied by their speedy resolution to reset the lock and issue a new card.,2014-09-16
1,1990,5,"The property is crowded with guests, which seems to be a frequent occurrence based on others feedback, which demonstrates the immense popularity of the hotel.",2014-09-16
1,1990,6,Hotel is accessible from Shinjuku JR west station via a shuttle bus (black colour) which runs trice hourly.,2014-09-16

1,1990,8,"Upon check-out, am delighted to be given a cute Hilton bear which was so much larger than the one received at Conrad Tokyo.",2014-09-16
1,1990,9,Took the airport limousine (a bus) arranged by the hotel to Narita,2014-09-16
1,1991,1,Its totally worth it!,2014-09-16
1,1991,2,I think 300+ for such hotel is an attractive price.,2014-09-16
1,1991,3,"They are 10mins walk away from station, have complimentary shuttle service to train station that runs at every 20mins intervals till almost 10pm, a 24 Hr gym, an indoor swimming pool till 10pm, Airport express bus to and from Narita or Hanade Airport.",2014-09-16
1,1991,4,"I stayed in their deluxe rooms be it queen, king or twin.",2014-09-16
1,1991,5,"Rooms are nice, clean, comfortable and spacious for Japan standard.",2014-09-16

1,1991,7,Cant quite remember who helped us that night to make a lunch reservation.,2014-09-16

1,1991,9,Kudos to their staff.,2014-09-16
1,1991,10,"On our day of departure, I saw the staff making ice shaven colored soda for children.",2014-09-16
1,1991,11,It such a heartwarming sight.,2014-09-16
1,1991,12,Will definitely return and recommend this hotel.,2014-09-16
1,1992,1,We stayed here for 6 nights on a 2 week trip to Japan.,2014-09-14
1,1992,2,"The location is excellent, in the heart of Shinjuku (though we realized later that for non-Japanese its better to stay in/around Roopongi).",2014-09-14
1,1992,3,The hotel has underground walkway access to Metro which was a great benefit.,2014-09-14
1,1992,4,The breakfast buffet was sumptuous though it never got changed for all 6 days (so we decided to skip it on our last day).,2014-09-14
1,1992,5,The rooms were small though but real estate in Tokyo is precious.,2014-09-14
1,1992,6,"If you get access to executive lounge, which we were, the 37th floor lounge has great views, food almost all day ans cocktails in the evening.",2014-09-14
1,1992,7,"Overall, a good choice.",2014-09-14
1,1993,1,"I don't usually opt for such large properties but booked here as a nod to a stay as a teenager, where I experienced terrific service… obviously this was quite a few years ago.",2014-09-14
1,1993,2,"Stayed in an executive junior suite, apparently newly refurbished.",2014-09-14
1,1993,3,"Overall, it's hard to fault this hotel as far as big chains go - this is a place for airline crews (SQ, LH, etc stay here), large groups of tourists and as a good location for a low cost leisure stay in Tokyo – Shinjuku has many points of interest in itself.",2014-09-14
1,1993,4,Rates are very low and there seem to be a lot of promos.,2014-09-14
1,1993,5,"To be fair, my overall rating of the property reflects this reality and not the comments below (which would score one or two points less).",2014-09-14
1,1993,6,"Without status however, this is not a welcoming property - it seems Hilton has taken loyalty to its limits, as, if anything, it now acts as a barrier of entry to non-HHonors guests - pretty stupid if you ask me.",2014-09-14
1,1993,7,"First time in ages I had to pay for Wifi (JPY1700/day) and denied checking out one hour later than standard as next guest ""had status and was entitled to check-in at exactly 2pm"" (would she?).",2014-09-14
1,1993,8,"Considering some guests don't mind paying for larger suites or better rooms, there is absolutely no reason to stay here without status since you will be treated worse than anyone with a Gold card - which are ubiquitous it seems thanks to countless tie-ins with credit cards or other promos...",2014-09-14
1,1993,9,The room itself is wholly uninspiring and looks very dated already - seem to have been assembled through a knock-off catalogue of bad Italian design - the only Japanese detail (and original from way back) are the rice paper sliding shutters - bathroom is tiny and reminiscent of the one in the Novotel Wanchai I had to stay in during a typhoon in Hong Kong.,2014-09-14
1,1993,10,"Very cheap amenities too - made in China toiletries, cheap/thin paper products and incredibly poor towels...",2014-09-14
1,1993,11,considering this is likely to be your first tactile experience of the room it immediately creates a poor impression - you know there are cost-savings at every turn.,2014-09-14
1,1993,12,There are some bad design choices too - a single multi-plug electric outlet by the desk is located in a box and under the glass table - very hard to access especially if using a larger three-point plug...,2014-09-14
1,1993,13,"Breakfast which I was looking forward to, was awful, with overall, poor quality items.",2014-09-14
1,1993,14,I was also admonished for picking a quieter table in the zoo of breakfast with a comment that it had to be vacated before 11am (at 9am...,2014-09-14
1,1993,15,why would anyone spend 2 hours with such a disappointing spread is anyone's guess).,2014-09-14
1,1993,16,"So there you have it – decent and dare I say convenient for a low cost stay, this property has made it pointless to book there for non-status guests looking for a better room / experience...",2014-09-14
1,1993,17,why keep being reminded of what you’re not receiving when it’s clear that so many of these so-called benefits are standard elsewhere… makes no sense.,2014-09-14
1,1993,18,"I’ve long got bored with chasing miles and points, after a few fun years with Randy and the original flyertalk crew, and as a former HH Diamond/ SPG Platinum/etc it strikes me that confusing loyalty management for true hospitality is probably a pretty bad long term mistake.",2014-09-14
1,1994,1,Got in pretty late and found out they had a room available to upgrade.,2014-09-13
1,1994,2,"It included internet and access to the Executive Lounge, a difference of about $50 bucks but was it worth it.",2014-09-13
1,1994,3,"Huge room, very clean.",2014-09-13
1,1994,4,"The executive lounge had a huge breakfast in the morning both Western dishes and Japanese dishes, they even had mimosas.",2014-09-13
1,1994,5,Great way to start the day!,2014-09-13
1,1994,6,And great cocktail hour with appetizers which was a nice way to relax after long day of sight seeing.,2014-09-13
1,1994,7,"The subway station is right under the hotel so it made getting around very easy,",2014-09-13
1,1995,1,Perfect location walking distance to the subway (and shuttle bus to the airport).,2014-09-11
1,1995,2,Perfect breakfast and lunch buffet.,2014-09-11
1,1995,3,"Perfect rooms, clean and nicely decorated.",2014-09-11
1,1995,4,Perfect restaurant with delicious tempuras.,2014-09-11
1,1995,5,"Perfect personnel: courteous, competent, friendly.",2014-09-11
1,1995,6,A hotel to go back to.,2014-09-11
1,1996,1,I stayed at the Hilton for a week while on business.,2014-09-11
1,1996,2,It is a beautiful hotel located in the business district of Shinjuku ku.,2014-09-11
1,1996,3,"The rooms were very modern and updated; The bathroom was fantastic (soaking tub); And I will always be charmed by Japanese toilets....yes, odd to say.....but the Japanese have created such fantastic toilets with so many settings its like driving a small car.",2014-09-11
1,1996,4,The train station is a very short walk or quick shuttle from the train station.,2014-09-11
1,1996,5,"Beware, I found the trains to be very complicated and I have traveled the world.",2014-09-11
1,1996,6,There is great shopping and restaurants close by.,2014-09-11
1,1996,7,"Get out at night and see the amazing light show of billboards, large screen videos, etc., all located just a few blocks from the hotel.",2014-09-11
1,1996,8,I had club level access which offered attentive service and great food options.,2014-09-11
1,1996,9,It was a nice mixture of Eastern and Western cuisine.,2014-09-11
1,1996,10,The view was spectacular.,2014-09-11
1,1996,11,"If you have time, book a private your guide who can help navigate you to some of the most impressive areas of Tokyo.",2014-09-11
1,1996,12,My guide was an amazing 70+ year old Japanese gentleman who spoke good English and met me at the hotel.,2014-09-11
1,1996,13,Dont get me wrong......You would never have known his age and he consistently out-paced me everywhere we went.,2014-09-11
1,1996,14,He was such a lovely man.,2014-09-11
1,1996,15,Be open to true Japanese cuisine.,2014-09-11
1,1996,16,Make sure you try Shabu-Shabu - the concierge can direct you to a recommended spot.,2014-09-11
1,1996,17,"Also, venture into a local sushi bar to get true sushi.",2014-09-11
1,1996,18,"I dont know what I ate, which was probably a good thing, but it was all delicious.",2014-09-11
1,1996,19,"I left my heart in Tokyo and can only pray that I have the opportunity to return to this beautiful, friendly, safe city.",2014-09-11
1,1996,20,I would absolutely stay at the Hilton upon my return.,2014-09-11
1,1997,1,This hotel is located close to Shinjuku station and has a free shuttle bus to and from the station every 20 mins.,2014-09-09
1,1997,2,This was one of the deciding factors in choosing it and it proved to be very handy indeed.,2014-09-09
1,1997,3,The Hilton itself is a very nice hotel with attentive staff and good amenities.,2014-09-09
1,1997,4,"Breakfast was excellent, so was room service.",2014-09-09
1,1997,5,"The pool looked inviting, but heated to 30 degrees so not an option in hot weather.",2014-09-09
1,1997,6,Our room was quiet and comfortable.,2014-09-09
1,1997,7,We asked for a room on a higher floor to avoid any possible renovation noise that was mentioned in some previous reviews.,2014-09-09
1,1997,8,We had no disruptions and slept well.,2014-09-09
1,1997,9,There is a small supermarket and several restaurants underneath the hotel and a chemist shop near the business centre.,2014-09-09
1,1997,10,We found these extra services very handy when tired and hot at the end of a long day.,2014-09-09
1,1997,11,We found Hilton Tokyo to be an excellent choice for tourists and thoroughly recommend it.,2014-09-09
1,1998,1,Stayed there for three nights on our return leg from Sapporo.,2014-09-08
1,1998,2,"The hotel was a drop-off/pick-up point for the airport limousine bus service, which means you'll be dropped at the door step of the hotel.",2014-09-08
1,1998,3,Room was spacious (for Tokyo's standard) and well appointed.,2014-09-08
1,1998,4,We stayed on the 33rd floor which offered a great view.,2014-09-08
1,1998,5,"Breakfast had good variety, but the food type appears to be the same.",2014-09-08
1,1998,6,"But if you're sitting at one of the sofa seats, the table can be a little low.",2014-09-08
1,1998,7,"A major advantage of Hilton is there's a shuttle bus every 20min running between the hotel and Shinjuku station, stopping in front of Keio department store.",2014-09-08
1,1998,8,This really helped as the walk to Shinjuku station from the hotel in the summer heat can be a challenge.,2014-09-08
1,1998,9,Another advantage is the hotel is linked underground to one of the Tokyo Metro's station.,2014-09-08
1,1998,10,Overall a very good experience,2014-09-08
1,1999,1,We asked for a room high up when we reserved and were rewarded with a lovely view of the megalopolis from one of the top floors.,2014-09-07
1,1999,2,Never a wait for the elevators and they are fast.,2014-09-07
1,1999,3,Excellent concierge service.,2014-09-07
1,1999,4,We had all sorts of strange requests ranging from printing out the michelin bib gourmand restaurants in Shinjuku (website only in Japanese :) and where to get a professional tailor's scissor as a friend in Paris had heard that the Japanese make the best.,2014-09-07
1,1999,5,Neither was a problem for the concierge (unfortunately I do not remember his name) who gladly took the time to research and write everything down.,2014-09-07
1,1999,6,The only negative experience was at the bar at night.,2014-09-07
1,1999,7,"Having ordered drinks and sitting at our table, I noticed I had to plug in my smart phone and proceeded to use a plug at the end of the bar where no one was sitting.",2014-09-07
1,1999,8,"The manager in charge rushed up to me enquiring 'Can I help you' - seeing I was just plugging in my phone, I took that to mean I needed to ask for his personal permission before deigning to use 'his' plug' It was a rather bizarre situation and I did complain to the Assistant Manager the next day who apologized.",2014-09-07
1,1999,9,But we never went back there so Hilton lost a bit of business from us because of that (had I been Assistant Manager I would have offered 2 drinks on the house the next evening).,2014-09-07
1,1999,10,"Location-wise you are walking distance to the Shinjuku station with rail lines going everywhere you need, usually with no need to transfer.",2014-09-07
1,1999,11,The walk is a brisk 20 minutes from door to train.,2014-09-07
1,1999,12,There is a shuttle from the bus to the station but if you are a walker it is better not to wait.,2014-09-07
1,1999,13,"We figured out a short cut going diagonally across the street to the lobby of the highrise (the one with the Willer Express buses in front of it), then down the escalator and left, out the door and straight to the station.",2014-09-07
1,1999,14,Also nice for a blast of AC when walking in the summer heat and humidity.,2014-09-07
1,1999,15,Overall a very good experience.,2014-09-07

1,2001,4,Then they exchanged my yen for new crisp yen for the card--I would not have even known that I should do that for the wedding!!,2014-09-04
1,2001,5,"The room was larger than I expected, the bathroom especially was great, the breakfast buffet and lounge were wonderful, the pool and spa were terrific, too.",2014-09-04

1,2003,3,I can say that the service at the Hilton Tokyo is the best I have experienced.,2014-09-03
1,2003,4,"For example, prior to visiting Tokyo I was working in Vietnam and didn't have time to plan my activities in advance.",2014-09-03
1,2003,5,I really wanted to see a Sumo Wrestling Match as well as a Japanese Baseball Game.,2014-09-03
1,2003,6,I called the concierge to see if they could assist me.,2014-09-03
1,2003,7,"I worked with Ayako, who was incredibly helpful.",2014-09-03
1,2003,8,"She informed me that there while there were no Sumo matches in Tokyo the weekend I was in town, there were a couple of events that I could attend outside of Tokyo.",2014-09-03

1,2003,10,"When I arrived at the hotel, not only did I have all of this information, but she even went so far as to include questions/directions in Japanese for me to hand to someone in either the train or taxi to make my journey easier.",2014-09-03
1,2003,11,I thought this went above and beyond anything I had expected.,2014-09-03

1,2004,1,My mate and I are 20 years old who are always willing to pay a little extra to have comfort and convenience.,2014-09-03
1,2004,2,When we first walked in their you could tell straight away that it lacked personality and was for those who just want to get in and out and have more money than they need.,2014-09-03
1,2004,3,I never expect much but I actually felt uncomfortable in this hotel.,2014-09-03
1,2004,4,I think it was because we were dressed in casual clothing.,2014-09-03
1,2004,5,"I requested an early check in at the desk and was told we could go in 2 hours earlier if we paid for a room that was 80,000 Yen more expensive, fair enough we couldn't get an early check in but that was a bit step.",2014-09-03
1,2004,6,"With WiFi in the room, there was an option for free WiFi at slow speeds or faster speeds for a cost.",2014-09-03
1,2004,7,"The slow speed that was advertised is what I was used to in Australia, with our slow internet.",2014-09-03
1,2004,8,"The internet barely worked, kept dropping out and was frustrating.",2014-09-03
1,2004,9,Also what was weird was that I then couldn't pay for the faster internet after I discovered how poor the connection was.,2014-09-03
1,2004,10,"The room was not that great (I had just come from the capsule hotel as well), it was nice but not for the prices that they advertise.",2014-09-03
1,2004,11,"The most helpful info I can give anyone that read this is that there is a shuttle bus to Narita Airport from the hotel, I paid about 36AUD I think it was about 3600 Yen. That was really convenient, although triple check and I MEAN TRIPLE check where and when the bus will arrive, because the staff may not be able to answer so well with the language barrier.",2014-09-03
1,2004,12,"I always appreciate the fact that they speak this second language for our convenience but please give the right answer (I don't want to sound mean but it was seriously a close call missing the bus which would have resulted in a missed flight, I'm so glad I stuck with my gut feeling and asked a third person)",2014-09-03
1,2005,1,I stayed at the Hilton Hotel in Shinjuku many times.,2014-09-02

1,2006,5,"Shinjuku is a great location, not far from a busy train station and loads of food and entertainment options.",2014-09-01
1,2006,6,The staff are amazing and friendly and help you organise anything you need.,2014-09-01
1,2006,7,There are direct Airport to hotel buses from both airports.,2014-09-01
1,2006,8,They work out to be around $30AUD.,2014-09-01

1,2035,5,"The bar in the lobby is a real life-saver at night, and the concierge has been quite helpful in providing a power adapter (do NOT think of traveling through Japan with a professional adapter with the central safety plug, almost no plug in Japan has the right socket for that!).",2014-08-16
1,2035,6,"The one thing that was a bit annoying was the WiFi: the sign-in only worked with Internet Explorer and as a matter of fact I find unacceptable that hotel WiFi is charged, it is such a commodity that it should be included in the room rate.",2014-08-16

1,2036,5,Negotiating the tube and trains took us a bit longer to master.,2014-08-14

1,2058,3,We were on the 25th floor and the view was stupendous - normally we are not the slightest bit concerned about having a 'room with a view' but in this case I take it all back.,2014-07-28
1,2058,4,We were so impressed that we decided to take our first meal in Tokyo in our room.,2014-07-28

1,2060,2,The location is perfect with a very handy shuttle to Shinjuku station that we used every day.,2014-07-25
1,2060,3,Frankly this hotel would get 5 stars if it wasn't for my pet hate which is when a place holds it's guests to ransom for their on site amenities.,2014-07-25
1,2060,4,"The prices in the foyer restaurant are just ridiculous, one late night we didn'd have the time or energy left to go out so ate in there and I paid 1800 Yen for fish & chips with the smallest portion of fish I'd ever seen - we were also hustled out of the restaurant after our meal as apparently the staff were keen to close (it was only about 9.30pm).",2014-07-25
1,2060,5,The bar in the hotel is lovely but again prices just too much to justify more than one drink there - they charge the same as the New York bar in the Park Hyatt except you don't get amazing table service and fantastic views of Tokyo!,2014-07-25

1,2127,8,I was told by the Front Desk Supervisor & Assistant Front Office Manager that usually this is not the case but provided no explanation.,2014-06-01
1,2127,9,"To add further insult to injury, I was told if I really wanted access to the Executive Lounge, I would need to move from my King room to a Twin room!",2014-06-01
1,2127,10,No big deal about accessing the lounge as being Gold makes it a privilege rather than a right but disappointed of not being told upfront at check in.,2014-06-01
1,2127,11,Ultimately both Front Desk Manager & Assistant Front Officer manager insisted I use the Executive Lounge for the rest of my stay.,2014-06-01

1,2136,11,Tall people (>6') will have no problems with the shower.,2014-05-27

1,2222,4,"Location-wise, it is not as good as Keio as Keio is closer to food and Shinjuku station.",2014-03-22

1,2254,2,This approach works well if one is staying put in Tokyo and does not need access to train service (if you will be using trains a lot it is better to find a hotel next to the main Tokyo train terminal).,2014-02-23

1,2254,22,The service was excellent and the staff were universally competent and very helpful.,2014-02-23

1,2289,6,It's also a short train journey to shibuya which has amazing themed restaurants.,2014-01-16
1,2289,7,There are no restaurants around this hotel for dinner though and most lunch places seem to be in the atria if large office buildings - best to be avoided.,2014-01-16

1,2290,5,The staff was superb in helping out and the concierge was top notch.,2014-01-15
1,2290,6,The breakfast in restaurant was superb!The best part is if you are arriving into Narita take the Airport shuttle bus and it drops you off at the front door.,2014-01-15
1,2290,7,Will be staying here again next time I come to Tokyo,2014-01-15
1,2291,1,"This Hilton has an executive lounge, but unless you book a room in the lounge floor, even with your Gold/Diamond status, you would not be able to access the lounge.",2014-01-13
1,2291,2,"We only found out during check-in and at that time, there wasn't any room available, even if we were to pay for the upgrade.",2014-01-13
1,2291,3,It is a disappointment for us as that is one of the main reasons I pick the Hilton brand hotel.,2014-01-13

1,2293,8,"Before our departure from Australia, I had to ensure that there would be three beds for my teenage children in their room as this was not clearly confirmed by the agent.",2014-01-12
1,2293,9,"So, I had to contact the hotel reservation department myself and we had a number of exchanges of email because they couldn't find our reservation due to some systematic issues with the travel agent.",2014-01-12
1,2293,10,I was so impressed by the efficiency of the reservation staff in locating our record and answering my enquiries.,2014-01-12

1,2296,1,What else can I say about the Hilton Tokyo other than it was a fantastic place to stay while in Tokyo.,2014-01-11
1,2296,2,I stayed for 3 nights by using Hilton Honors Points.,2014-01-11
1,2296,3,Checking into this hotel was a smooth process as the front desk staff was friendly as well as professional (and spoke fluent English).,2014-01-11
1,2296,4,The room was what I would expect from a Hilton seeing how it was clean and arranged quite well so that any guest would feel comfortable.,2014-01-11
1,2296,5,Though my view from the 37th floor was a nice added bonus.,2014-01-11
1,2296,6,The executive lounge was a nice place to grab a tasty snack and drink in the morning and the evening.,2014-01-11
1,2296,7,They really take good care of Hilton Honors gold members.,2014-01-11
1,2296,8,"Although the hotel wasn't a close walk to Shinjuku Station, the complimentary shuttle service accounted for that fact.",2014-01-11
1,2296,9,If you don't want to wait for the shuttle there are also two subway lines within walking distance below the hotel which was also quite convenient.,2014-01-11
1,2296,10,"Overall this is a great, quality hotel to stay at while in Tokyo and it is exactly what you would expect from a Hilton property.",2014-01-11
1,2297,1,Used Hilton Honors Points for 2 rooms so can’t really complain.,2014-01-10
1,2297,2,Staff were courteous and helpful.,2014-01-10
1,2297,3,Our rooms were not particularly luxurious but fine.,2014-01-10
1,2297,4,I wondered whether you get nicer rooms if you are not using Loyalty Points.,2014-01-10
1,2297,5,Breakfast buffet was very nice but needs a little reorganising.,2014-01-10
1,2297,6,There were huge queues.,2014-01-10
1,2297,7,Residents should be encouraged to go to different stations and there would be more numerous but shorter queues.,2014-01-10
1,2297,8,"What was happening was that the polite residents were joining a ONE LONG queue of people many of whom just wanted, say, the Japanese breakfast but not the Western one.",2014-01-10
1,2297,9,So all the residents who wanted the western food would wait behind the clients selecting their miso soup and grilled fish.,2014-01-10
1,2297,10,A bit barmy really and easily solved by delineating the cuisines somehow.,2014-01-10
1,2297,11,It got to the stage where we would just cut right in for our sausages and scrambled egg.,2014-01-10
1,2297,12,"It looked really rude but life is too short to wait in a line behind 20 people, many of whom don’t even want what you want – it’s just that what they want comes first!",2014-01-10
1,2297,13,This is not a hugely picturesque area (finding the hotel by following signs for Metropolitan Govt Offices gives you a clue!) Lots of good eateries close by (including the underground passes) if you know to look.,2014-01-10
1,2297,14,Our first stop was the nearby Spaghetti Goemon – I love pasta done Japanese style!,2014-01-10
1,2297,15,There are several different conbinis (convenience stores) nearby and they sell different brands of beer so if you have a favourite tipple have a quick look.,2014-01-10
1,2297,16,My husband found a favourite black beer in a conbini which was pretty useless for everything else!,2014-01-10
1,2297,17,One travel tip – if you are arriving at Narita Airport on a Friday or Saturday evening and do not have much luggage consider taking the Narita Express to Shinjuku.,2014-01-10
1,2297,18,Our ride in on the “Friendly Airport Limousine Bus” took over 2 hours because of the weekend traffic.,2014-01-10
1,2297,19,"On the way out however, we left at 7am and the ride was fine.",2014-01-10
1,2297,20,And of course the bus is much handier if you have more luggage as it is door to door.,2014-01-10
1,2297,21,Japanese people travel very light as they often use a courier service (eg Takkubin).,2014-01-10
1,2298,1,My husband and 4 friends stayed 5 nights at Tokyo Hilton.,2014-01-10
1,2298,2,This was our second trip to Tokyo and I have to say that Tokyo Hilton just made it perfect!,2014-01-10

1,2298,5,and this was HEAVEN!,2014-01-10
1,2298,6,The buffet breakfast was amazing.,2014-01-10
1,2298,7,It is probably only second to Glass buffet breakfast.,2014-01-10
1,2298,8,There was a wonderful manager there by the name of Leon who honestly made the trip even more special!,2014-01-10
1,2298,9,He gave us so many tips and didnt mind that I ordered 3 double espresso's every morning as the coffee was so good!,2014-01-10
1,2298,10,The gym there is AMAZING.,2014-01-10
1,2298,11,and there is a sauna and swimming pool.,2014-01-10
1,2298,12,The hotel itself is about a 10minute walk to Shinjuku station but honestly its worth it.,2014-01-10
1,2298,13,On our nights out we would catch a cab home which was only about 700 YEN.,2014-01-10
1,2298,14,Cannot recommend it enough...its true hilton luxury.,2014-01-10
1,2299,1,"Before my trip to Tokyo, I researched the best location to spend four day exploring this mega city and I settled for this Hilton close to the Shinjuku station.",2014-01-10
1,2299,2,"Well, after I arrived I realized that for a first time tourist in the city, the best place to stay in Tokyo is somewhere close to the Tokyo station, 20 minutes by subway from the Hilton.",2014-01-10
1,2299,3,It will save you hours of commute to the best attractions in this wonderful city.,2014-01-10
1,2299,4,"Other than the location, this Hilton is a great hotel, with outstanding service (kind of the norm in Japan) but dated rooms with tiny bathrooms.",2014-01-10
1,2299,5,The breakfast is amazing so try to get it included in your rate.,2014-01-10
1,2300,1,We loved this hotel.,2014-01-10
1,2300,2,"As a family of four with two young boys, we booked a suite to accommodate two extra roller-a-way beds.",2014-01-10
1,2300,3,"This was cheaper than booking two rooms, which we had to do at most other Japanese hotels and a great option to really spread out and feel relaxed.",2014-01-10
1,2300,4,"The suite was very large, with a great view over Shinjuku office buildings.",2014-01-10
1,2300,5,"Our king size bed was so comfortable, it was just so good, I keep wanting to be back in it!",2014-01-10
1,2300,6,The large room with great beds was a wonderful way to rest after all our shopping.,2014-01-10
1,2300,7,The breakfast was fantastic with Western and Japanese options.,2014-01-10
1,2300,8,The kids loved the pancakes & donuts and my husband loved the omelette station.,2014-01-10
1,2300,9,"Breakfast was included in the advance payment web option, so great value.",2014-01-10
1,2300,10,"The bathroom could have been a little more modern, but we were happy with it.",2014-01-10
1,2300,11,The free shuttle bus to & from the train station was great for getting to the shopping district.,2014-01-10
1,2300,12,We loved this hotel & would stay again.,2014-01-10
1,2301,1,Our stay in this hotel was nothing short of fantastic.,2014-01-09
1,2301,2,"The hotel is very clean, the beds are comfortable, and the room we stayed in had an updated bathroom.The hotel is also situated in a very convenient area.",2014-01-09
1,2301,3,It is close to a number of eating places and within walking distance to Family Mart and Starbucks.,2014-01-09
1,2301,4,Transportation is not a problem as well since the hotel has a link underground to the Marunouchi Line.,2014-01-09
1,2301,5,The complimentary shuttle service to Shinjuku Station was also frequent and convenient during our stay.,2014-01-09
1,2301,6,"Our experience with Hilton Tokyo was almost perfect in every way except that, when we checked in, it took a while before we were able to get a room.",2014-01-09
1,2301,7,"This was, however, not so much of an issue as we stayed in the lobby while waiting, and the entire place smelled terrific (some sort of green tea fragrance).",2014-01-09
1,2301,8,Their staff was also very helpful.,2014-01-09
1,2301,9,"My brother bought plenty of stuff from Amazon, and we were always notified by phone to pick them up just when we get back to our room.",2014-01-09
1,2301,10,We stayed in the upper floors and the city view outside was also nice.,2014-01-09
1,2301,11,I would recommend this hotel to anyone though their rates may be a bit steep for budget travelers.,2014-01-09
1,2302,1,"Let's begin by saying we have very high expectation of hotels and have stayed in many across the Hilton Group of hotels, unfortunately our experience at the Hilton Tokyo was not one that we enjoyed.",2014-01-09
1,2302,2,Yes staff were courteous and helpful but that's the minimum requirement for a 4-5 star hotel.,2014-01-09
1,2302,3,The room we stayed in has obviously not been renovated.,2014-01-09
1,2302,4,The wall paper on the ceiling was peeling left right and centre and the bathroom clearly demonstrated it was desperately in need for a massive update (I assume this is happening already as mentioned in other reviews but unfortunately we got stuck with an old one).,2014-01-09
1,2302,5,The room was extremely underwhelming and we were glad we only stayed for two nights.,2014-01-09
1,2302,6,"Apart from the lobby, I'm not sure if anything else has been renovated recently, the sauna/spa area was basic and the executive lounge tired.",2014-01-09
1,2302,7,The offering at the lounge was also far inferior to other Hilton properties.,2014-01-09
1,2302,8,Breakfast was crowded but at least the variety was decent.,2014-01-09
1,2302,9,"In terms of location, it's not inconvenient but certainly not very convenient either.",2014-01-09
1,2302,10,"The hotel is connected by underground walkways to Nishi-Shinjuku station, approx.",2014-01-09
1,2302,11,"5 mins walk or there's a free hotel shuttle that takes you to Shinjuku Station, outside Odakyu Department store.",2014-01-09
1,2302,12,"Overall, the service (software) is 5 star quality but the dated hardware (room/facilities) made it really difficult to enjoy.",2014-01-09
1,2302,13,"For the price it charges, there are more modern alternatives and for us personally, the chances of returning is slim and recommendation to friends/family is unlikely.",2014-01-09
1,2303,1,"The location is great in the center of the city next to a train station, and believe me I used taxis in tokyo as they are more confit able than a public train but the traffic is horrible so location is quite important",2014-01-09
1,2304,1,My travel agent recommended this hotel and it was a good stay.,2014-01-09
1,2304,2,"However, my expectations were different - being a frequent international American traveler - and this was my first overnight trip to Asia.",2014-01-09
1,2304,3,I got to the hotel fairly late -past midnight as my flight landed late and had to fork out $120USD for a cab (no trains running that late).,2014-01-09
1,2304,4,"When I checked in, I was a bit disappointed to find out I'd be in a room with 2 twin beds - they didn't have anything else.",2014-01-09
1,2304,5,This kinda blew my tone for the rest of the trip as I have never stayed in a hotel room with a double bed or smaller.,2014-01-09
1,2304,6,Call me spoiled.,2014-01-09
1,2304,7,And the fact we were spending over $350 USD a night I was just expecting a bigger bed.,2014-01-09
1,2304,8,The lobby area was nicely decorated and surprisingly busy for being 1 am.,2014-01-09
1,2304,9,A quick elevator ride and short walk to my room made me realize I'm in a cruise-ship style room.,2014-01-09
1,2304,10,It was definitely smaller than I'm used to at Hilton properties.,2014-01-09
1,2304,11,"Then again, this IS Japan.",2014-01-09
1,2304,12,It was nicely decorated and the sliders blocking the windows/light did their job quite well.,2014-01-09
1,2304,13,Fortunately the hotel had a few US channels and some with english subtitles.,2014-01-09
1,2304,14,I had to spend a few bucks to login to the internet as the city-wide WIFI through the cell providers have instructions ONLY in Japanese & Google was not translating it very well :),2014-01-09
1,2304,15,"The bathroom was alright, but the toilet controls were definitely neat.",2014-01-09
1,2304,16,"I've never sat on a toilet seat that can play music, warm itself up, and also spray your butt.",2014-01-09
1,2304,17,"I've always had a separate bidet, so kudos to the Japanese for making it all one toilet.",2014-01-09

1,2304,23,Hotel staff during my stay were good.,2014-01-09
1,2304,24,I was happy that the concierge desk sells the visitors pass for the train - $5 USD/day and the stations are very close to the hotel.,2014-01-09
1,2304,25,"The Denny's nearby is NOT your traditional Denny's -- there is a McDonalds around the corner of the hotel that has a fairly ""Americanized"" menu, and I believe a 7-11'esque type store also sold comfort foods to satisfy any culture.",2014-01-09
1,2304,26,"The hotel is in the Shinjuku area of Tokyo - which is great if you are doing business here as this is where most companies have offices, but if you are playing a tourist like me, its WWWAAAYYY out of the way.",2014-01-09
1,2304,27,I had to take a 20 minute subway ride to Tokyo Station just to get anywhere.,2014-01-09

1,2304,29,"These tours typically will leave Tokyo Station and I'd recommend the Tokyo Skytree & Asukusa Tour (about $65 USD) and also make it to the Ueno Park Zoo. I also found the city to be VERY tourist friendly - maps everywhere, and also in English.",2014-01-09
1,2304,30,And if you don't know the language -- most restaurants have picture guides of their menus.,2014-01-09
1,2304,31,"Now, I may backtrack a bit - if you are flying in and out of Narita, the NEX departs from just a few blocks away...",2014-01-09
1,2304,32,so its not totally out of the way.,2014-01-09
1,2304,33,Stay was overall pleasant.,2014-01-09
1,2304,34,I was just expecting something different because of the high price paid for the room.,2014-01-09

1,2308,4,"Staff is friendly, but at times aloof.",2014-01-04
1,2308,5,"Check-in seems to consistently be an issue and not sure why, and not sure why they want to charge guests a cash only fee to hold bags.",2014-01-04
1,2308,6,This is an issue ESP for business travelers who are spending upwards of four months at this hotel.,2014-01-04
1,2308,7,"The gym is fine, there is a lap pool as well.",2014-01-04
1,2308,8,Executive lounge is nice for breakfast and a drink in the evening.,2014-01-04
1,2309,1,this is a really good hotel...for many reasons...we stayed here for 7 nights on holiday and it was a great experience....,2014-01-04
1,2309,2,1. great location...sits above the train system where you can easily walk to the Marunouchi Line as well as the Oedo Line....both of those lines can easily get you to many places or easy transfers to other main lines such as Ginza Line....so as far as convenience very very good....but just keep in mind you do have a walk...,2014-01-04
1,2309,3,"2. The rooms are big, clean and comfortable...the only minor issue was the bathrooms was a little small...but at least very clean and had all the amenities",2014-01-04

1,2309,6,"5. if you are diamond adn have access to the lounge...then even better....i have been to many hotel lounges (new york, san fran, paris, london, even conrad tokyo...etc etc) and i have to say this is definitely one of the best of them all....in terms of the food and drink selection and quality...and again the service team at the lounge...really really impressive...friendly helpful good attitude....great experience",2014-01-04
1,2309,7,6. the hotel was also relatively easy to get to from Narita airport....we took the bus to and from the airport...only two stops along the way.....the whole journey once on the bus is about 90-110 minutes depending on traffic.....but its convenient if you have alot of luggage....if you dont have lot of luggage....you can take the Narita express to Shinjuku station...then do quick one stop trip on subway to nishi-shinjuku station which is almost under the hotel....about 250 meter walk....,2014-01-04
1,2309,8,7. the hotel is not too far of a walk from shinjuku area....if it were not for the cold weather it woudl actaully be a nice walk....as its very clean and pleasant area.....,2014-01-04
1,2309,9,8. outside the hotel to the right about 300 meters is a really nice supermarket...so if you need anything or want some fruit or drinks for the room its really easy to go out and pick up some things....,2014-01-04
1,2309,10,the only things to be prepared for about the hotel are the following:,2014-01-04
1,2309,11,1. the plugs in the room are NOT international so you will need to bring at least one adapter...if you are there on business...then you might need TWO adapters...one for your computer and one for phone.....,2014-01-04
1,2309,12,2. the lighting at the desk was not sufficient....,2014-01-04
1,2309,13,3. there is no plug near the bedside...so little difficult to charge the phone and use it as alarm...,2014-01-04
1,2309,14,4. if you are trying to get into TOP tier restaurants the hotel concierge does not seem to have the power to get seats.....i gave them a list of about 15 top rated restaurants and could not get me into any....so i had my local friend call and he was able to get me into 4 of them...i do want to clarify....the concierge team is amazing....they are very hard working....friendly...knowledgeable and helpful....i just think for some reason they dont have the pull at those great food places....just a heads up....so if you are looking to get in try to use just local person to call and reserve for you...if possible....,2014-01-04
1,2309,15,i would definitely stay here again....either business or holiday.....,2014-01-04

1,2313,4,There is also a shuttle to/from Shinjuku station.,2014-01-02
1,2313,5,"If you are Hilton Honors member, I found it to be worth the extra commute to stay here for extended visits--- and btw, get to know the Subway system -- a cab ride to Roppongi will cost $50+, or ~$3 by subway, and take about the same amount of time.",2014-01-02

1,2317,1,Have always rated Hilton Tokyo Hotel higly on their great lounge service。 However，with the holiday season the hotel is fully booked and the executive lounge was not able to cope with the flow of guests especially during evening cocktail。 The hotel made a disapponting arrangement to have guests enjoy their two-hour cocktail service in an area where everyone just had to stand or squat on the floor。 For the price that each executive room is being charged，I am sure the hotel could do better！,2013-12-30
1,2318,1,Overall we thought the hotel was nice although we were little bit underwhelmed as we had expected better service.,2013-12-30
1,2318,2,If you are looking for a hotel with view of mount Fuji then I would recommend this hotel.,2013-12-30

1,2318,6,However its only about 10-15min walk to Shinjuku station (there is also a free minibus) so when you want to be in the tourist track it wont be long.,2013-12-30
1,2318,7,Rooms,2013-12-30
1,2318,8,Apart from the view we found the rooms bit weak.,2013-12-30
1,2318,9,Decor was old and minimalistic and it did not feel like a warm place.,2013-12-30
1,2318,10,Even the suite was so old.,2013-12-30
1,2318,11,The bathroom definetely did not live up to the standard of a suite in our view.,2013-12-30

1,2318,18,Service,2013-12-30
1,2318,19,Similarly to other people writing here we did not feel the warm service we had anticipated in Japan and experienced in most other places we have visited.,2013-12-30
1,2318,20,The service was very robotic and cold.,2013-12-30
1,2318,21,When we called the reception to arrange extra beds as we had requested at time of booking we were told that there would be extra charge.,2013-12-30
1,2318,22,After going to reception it was cleared but this should not happen for top class hotel.,2013-12-30
1,2318,23,I do not want to be forced to go down to get what I had paid for.,2013-12-30
1,2318,24,Restaurants,2013-12-30
1,2318,25,"We only tried the breakfast, which was one of the best I have had in a hotel before.",2013-12-30

1,2320,2,The staff would bend over backwards for their guests.,2013-12-29
1,2320,3,I requested a Mt. Fuji view and probably got the best view we could get.,2013-12-29
1,2320,4,"They also let us check in early, ~11am.",2013-12-29
1,2320,5,We showed up a bit earlier than expected and they accommodated us in any way we wanted.,2013-12-29
1,2320,6,The rooms are normal sized rooms for a Hilton.,2013-12-29

1,2320,18,We timed it.,2013-12-29
1,2320,19,If you are arriving at that station and plan on walking i would recommend printing a map for reference.,2013-12-29
1,2320,20,We used Google maps on our phone and it made it easier.,2013-12-29
1,2320,21,There is a shuttle that will pick you up at the station but it might be hard to find it first time.,2013-12-29

1,2338,2,So we did get our luggage transferred (for US$10 per piece) and it was very convenient as it arrived on the same day.,2013-12-08
1,2338,3,Plus we could do our last sightseeing in the city then moved to the Tokyo Bay area by train with only our day packs.,2013-12-08

1,2338,5,She had mentioned how convenient it will be for our family to travel away from Shinjuku by train as the hotel's basement is connected to the Nishi-Shinjuku station.,2013-12-08
1,2338,6,We always used the trains and at the end of each day it was really nice to walk in the warmth of that basement walkway as it got so much colder at night.,2013-12-08
1,2338,7,We booked a standard room and got randomly upgraded to a newly refurbished room!,2013-12-08
