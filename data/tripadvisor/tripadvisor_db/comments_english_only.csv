1,REDACTED,en,1,"We had a wonderful stay at the Hilton Tokyo. The hotel is lovely and elegant with excellent customer service. We traveled as a family with our 2 college aged children and would stay here again! 

The CONCIERGE STAFF IS THE BEST WE HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED!!! They speak fluent English and provided us with personalized detailed maps of every location we were interested in visiting. One time when we could not make it back to the desk to follow up on one of the sites, a detailed letter was left for us in our room with all of the pertinent information. They WOWED us! They also made our reservations home through Narita airport. 

The Hotel/Location: The hotel is lovely and elegant and the rooms are spacious. As a Gold member, both of our rooms were easily upgraded. The hotel is located in Shinjuku and offers a free shuttle (a large bus) to and from the Shinjuku train station every 20 minutes - see picture (last bus from station at 9:40 pm). There are also 2 train lines walkable and directly under the hotel. 

The only negatives are 1. In the room there was a combo bathtub next to the shower and the shower heads did not quite properly fit the shower even if adjusted. It was a little awkward to use the shower, and 2. House keeping generally cleaned later in the day which was inconvenient. We came back to our room a couple of times, early afternoon after sight seeing and wanted to relax but our rooms had not been cleaned. 

Buffet Breakfast: The buffet breakfast in (Marble Lounge Restaurant) was fantastic with many choices ($40 per person or free if your are a Gold HH member. You can eat breakfast in the Marble Restaurant in lieu of the Executive Lounge.). The only negative, which was minor, was that the coffee and cappuccino were not very good. 

Executive Lounge: The lounge is lovely with a great view including of Mt Fuji. It is large in size with many choices especially at breakfast. There is also a chef to make omelettes. Waki (staff) had so much personality and offered so many travel suggestions. There was an issue accommodating guests for cocktail hours (6-9 pm) and we had to wait on line to actually get into the lounge. A couple of times, we left our name on the ""list"" and they called us when a table became available. 

Staff: Overall the staff was super friendly, helpful, eager to please and most spoke fluent English. The only issue we had was at checkout when our bill was completely wrong. It still has not been resolved but I cannot fault the Hilton Tokyo. This is a Hilton Honors issue.",5,2018/01/11
1,REDACTED,en,2,"Recently stayed at Hilton Tokyo for 6 nights.
From check in to check out everything was smooth and the staff are very helpful.
The concierge desk is very very helpful and speak fluent English.
Had booked a room on the higher floor and was surprised with the size. Pretty large for Tokyo Standard.
Breakfast was super and all the dining options within the hotel were good.
Very conveniently located with the shuttle bus to Shinjuku station every 20 min is very helpful.
Great variety of restaurants and shopping below the hotel and a tube station below the hotel helps as well.
Airport Limousine bus transfers is the best way to get here. Very simple and the stop is at the hotel.
Overall fell in love with Tokyo and part of the reason is this property.
Will definitely come back.",5,2017/09/18
1,REDACTED,en,3,"Great hotel, near to two different subway lines and an efficient free shuttle to and from Shinjuku station. Rooms were spacious, clean and up to hilton global standards.
I couldn’t give it five stars due to the avaricious prices within the hotel however.
My bill for 6 chicken wings, hummus & bread and 2 beers was ¥8,800 (€65.98). 
In my almost 15 years of legally purchasing alcohol, this was the most I’ve ever paid for a pint of standard beer - €16.49. 
That put a dampener on my stay and I would be reluctant to stay there again because of it.",4,2018/01/11
1,REDACTED,en,4,"This was my first time staying in Hilton Tokyo. Hotel locates in Shinjuku, where it is at a walkable distance from Shinjuku station or there is free shuttle to & fro Shinjuku stat at every 20-mins. Also, you can walk underground from Nishi-Shinjuku or Tochomae station. 
The housekeeping of room, the service from front desk & the lounge are at Hilton standard. The buffet breakfast is the best among all the Hiltons I accommodated. The view from the executive lounge is also amazing, you can see the Mount Fuji when the weather is clear.",5,2018/01/09
1,REDACTED,en,5,We visited few different hilton hotels. My partner and I both surprised the quality and service level from Hilton Tokyo. Best friendly staffs ever from our stays. The room is tidy and spacious compares to other accomendation in Tokyo. Prime location to most of the popular places in Shinjuku. Highly Recommended to anyone if you prepare to stay around Shinjuku for couple of days.,5,2018/01/09
1,REDACTED,en,6,"It is winter in Tokyo and though it is not snowing, it is very cold. We have stayed at the Hilton for 5 nights and it has been lovely to return to this warm hotel after a busy day sightseeing.

The hotel is right above the Nishishinjuku Train station which makes it really convenient to get around.

The rooms are very nice and the staff were very accommodating to make sure we had an interconnecting room with our sons.

The beds are very comfortable, and our bathroom had a lovely deep bath, not to mention state of the art top of the range heated toilet with about 20 buttons!

The bar has a nice 3 piece band performing most nights and was also a very relaxing place after dinner.

The restaurants are expensive, especially for a family of 4, however there are alternatives in a round building next door, and some under the Hilton.

",5,2018/01/08
1,REDACTED,en,7,"The most impressive part of Hilton Tokyo to me was, the property indeed possesses qualities and styles that classic hotels all have, which sometimes often difficult to find from hotels in in Tokyo. 

Tokyo being very populous and expensive city, many hotels including top notch ones, only occupies top floors of skyscrapers, sharing mid and bottom parts with business offices. However this hotel has its building solely for its own uses, making the hotel feel more like comfortable instant home away from home. 

This hotel utilizes huge area for executive club lounge which offer panoramic views of Japan including Mt. Fuji and other famous landmarks (I wasn’t very interested much except the Mountain Fuji view but I could definitely tell one of the most valuable assets for the hotel is, good location which provides such good panoramic views in the heart of bustling city)

I heard the lounge is always so full, but I was lucky to enjoy good time without crowd, and I took breakfast at lounge all the time despite I heard breakfast restaurants on 1st and 2nd floors provides much more menus.

One bad thing was, restaurants the concierge recommended – classic Japanese deep fries course restaurants, wasn’t much to my satisfaction personally. The restaurants had many good reviews from tripadvisor I saw, but my own perception is, anything can taste good if fried and there are too many good stuffs to enjoy with the price of the deep fries course meal- I heard deep fries are one of the high-end meals in Japan, but hope concierge offers more options for the guests who ask for good recommendation.

The location is, I wouldn’t say, it is too perfect, because it requires hotel shuttle bus or quick taxi ride from Shinjuku and nearby stations, but the hotel has very good access from both Haneda & Narita airport. I usually do not like taking subways but in Japan, there are almost no options. However, you can take airport limousines from both airports (but it takes bit more than then taking subways), and hotel can book your return bus to airport. The hotel is also easy to go to Ginza, Omotesando, and other popular areas by subway (connected to hotel ground floor). 

As i heard, the hotel rarely gives gold benefit- anyway, I booked executive rooms because I wanted access to executive lounge as I ways do. The hotel say they are always full so I recommend to book the types of rooms you want even if you are a diamond or gold member. The hotel seems busy all the time indeed. 

I would definitely consider being there again. (some of reviews I studied before my trip had, some staffs are not very nice but for my stay, most staffs were very professional and nice, and provided excellent service with feeling of hospitality).",4,2018/01/07
1,REDACTED,en,8,"Simply a phenomenal Hilton property, the property is maintained to the highest standards and is immaculate. The suites are large, wonderfully designed, great showers, overall a five star experience. The exec lounge is one of the best on the globe, excellent assortment and best in class. Stay here with confidence.",5,2018/01/06
1,REDACTED,en,9,We just spent 5 nights at the hotel in two rooms and it was excellent. The location and shuttle service to Shinjuku really makes the place special. Breakfast in the marble lounge is a real treat with a massive variety of items to chose from. The executive lounge is outstanding and I felt like they really respected my diamond status with Hilton and I would like to personally thank all of the staff in the executive lounge for such incredible service and providing us with wonderful rooms. They remember your name when you walk in and even remember how you like your coffee. The main concierges are also very helpful and kind. Even the staff working the motor court and shuttle are so friendly and helpful.,5,2018/01/06
1,REDACTED,en,10,"We stayed at the Hilton for 5 days over the New Year period, the busiest tourist sean in Japan. 
Arriving on an early morning flight from Sydney we were offered an early room at 8am (not the room we booked but happy to take a room with twin beds to get early access at no cost). The hotel was booked out but managed very well to deal with the high volume. We had access to the lounge (being diamond members) which had good food and drinks and an amazing view of Mt Fuji.
We used their shuttle bus to Shinkuju station but its an easy walk (we bused it due to the cold).
We were offerred a traditional Japanese breakfast in a small room on the 2nd floor which was lovely.
There are a number of dining options in the hotel, we ate in the buffet once (ok, not brilliant) and the St George's bar (warning- they smoke in the bar) which had live jazz music each night. They have a gorgeous patisserie to buy take away cakes, highly recommended.

Didn't use the fitness centre or pool but both looked good.

Room was a good size (more than enough room for two large suitcases). Has a fridge and coffee making. Very quiet, didn't hear any noise from adjoining rooms. We used our Hilton Honors points so this wonderful stay was free other than food and incidentals. Have stsyed before and would stay again.
",5,2018/01/05
1,REDACTED,en,11,"I had stayed at Hilton Tokyo for 3 nights and I must say it was truly a pleasure.
The staff are extremely friendly and most of them can speak English fluently.
The rooms are quite large and absolutely spotless.
Their restaurants provide mouthwatering food that makes you come back crawling for more and don't get me started on their Strawberry Buffet it has everything from cakes to chocolate fountains.
It was truly a extraordinary experience and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a comfortable stay.
100% confident I'm coming back.",5,2018/01/05
1,REDACTED,en,12,"This hotel is very well located, the rooms are spacious and clean and the staff is just great. In particular, Mr Yuhsuke Kasano, Duty Manager, was very accommodating and wanted to make sure that we were satisfied with our stay and that our room and experience met our expectations. Our experience could have been very different but this gentleman took good care of us. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Tokyo for the first time or repeat visitors. The concierge staff was also pleasant and accommodating. Overall great experience.",5,2018/01/04
1,REDACTED,en,13,"First time in Tokyo and this was a Great place to explore the city from. Convenient to subways, shopping, and food! The rooms were very clean and the hotel has nice amenities as well as a really cool view!",5,2018/01/03
1,REDACTED,en,14,"This hotel was more suitable for business oriented people than for a family of 5 like us. Apart from the awkward location, we still like the hotel for their people and service. They are so polite and nice.",4,2018/01/03
1,REDACTED,en,15,"Spent 5 evenings during Christmas at Hilton Shinjuku. Overall it was a good experience with efficient check-in/check-out process, convenient location to main shopping areas / restaurants / subway stations. Staff was friendly and speaks good English. The only improvement point was the housekeeping service. The daily make-up room service was rather late (usually came around 3pm to 4pm) and the cleaning was not thorough. Used utilities and vanity kits were sometimes not refilled and the bathroom could be cleaner (especially the floor).",4,2018/01/03
1,REDACTED,en,16,"A great hotel to stay in Tokyo.
Very well appointed rooms with an excellent club lounge.
Stay in the higher rooms but it is a very close mfortable hotel for a family in a very handy location.
We stayed in the newer rooms so ask for them when booking.",4,2018/01/02
1,REDACTED,en,17,"This is a huge hotel and we were there at an incredibly busy time over new year. There were issues we faced and they brought my rating down. The physical hotel is nice. Standard rooms are comfortable and whilst bathrooms are small with showers in the tub, they certainky worked well and were clean.

Service is where it becomes hit and miss and it seems the excuse is ""It's a big hotel"". 

Gold upgrade not provided. I can understand during busy periods however I believe the reason why they couldn't accomodate us was simply that they don't plan properly and advised me they totally ignore the online check in. Why ask guests to check in, what time they will arrive and also confirm that early check in which provides room assignment automatically (and gave me no choice) will not impact upgrades. When i arrived I was offered a twin upgrade after booking a king with a confirmed kids bed. I was told that I had selected a room already (complete contradiction to the online system), I was told one cannot book extra beds (it in facts states you must when booking) and when I challenged this I was asked to prove it which I did. I was then told if we keep the standard king room then we wouldn't be entitled to lounge access and breakfast. All in all not a good start. Basically in the end they ""generously"" offered ""something they never do"" which was lounge access. What I feel is a gold card entitlement. After all this they then said they were moving us to a different room which was a little more spacious. What I don't understand is how then they managed to get the extra bed into the room in the minutes it took us to get upstairs. Something was off. They had said they would send up amenities For the extra person with the bed. We waited 2.5 hours until 10pm to get a bath towel. The whole thing felt sordid.

This was followed by concierge failing to assist effectively with restaurant reservations leaving us stranded and forced to eat in a smokey Hilton restaurant that was like a zoo with very average food and highly over priced.

There were too many dropped balls and the underlying issue seemed to be that everyone wanted to argue about everything rather than take responsibility and make it right, as the promised. Room service was awful with poorly cooked food. Cold fries and 90 minutes to eventually recieve over priced but edible food. Again they new there were issues as they had to replace food twice yet no one made it right.

They tried on check out but that's too late.

I have had too many sub par experiences with Hilton who it seems are struggling world wide to compete in terms of service and the ""make it right"" philosophy is great if delivered on.

It's a shame as the hotel has all the makings of a great experience but in all honesty the team need to stand up and be responsible for the short comings.",3,2018/01/02
1,REDACTED,en,18,"Stayed here for business. The staff was friendly. The breakfast was one of the best I have had. The food options were amazing. The rooms were clean and plush, although a tad small by American standards. The bathroom shower/tub/steam combo was lovely. Suggest reserving rooms well in advance. I had one small hiccup where I tried to extend my stay by 1 night. After checking with hotel front desk staff numerous times, and being told hotel was sold out, I discovered rooms were available online. When I checked with the front desk, they confirmed I could stay one additional night at DOUBLE my nightly rate. I had to switch hotels to the Westin, which was amazing but across town. 
The hotel is in a nice neighborhood, has close access to the subway system and is walking distance to parks, etc. Great stay.",5,2018/01/01
1,REDACTED,en,19,"I had tried to call in earlier and requested to have a higher floor for my junior suite. Was told it was subjected to availability. On my arrival, I was told that there are no rooms on higher floor available as I’ve book for a week and they don’t have any room on a high floor. Instead I was put on a very low floor with no privacy. It was obvious that the room was not used for a long time, my sensitive nose was sneezing all the way when I was in the room. Had to resort to wearing mask in the room. Terrible experience.",1,2018/01/01
1,REDACTED,en,20,I simply loved this hotel . We stayed here for the New Years this year and we had a great time . The staff are really friendly and helpful and the hotel really clean and spacious .

1,REDACTED,en,21,Excellent location. Beautiful views of the cities. Great staffs service. I wouldn’t stay anywhere else when I visit Tokyo. Thank you Hilton Honor Members service. Hilton has done a great job in this facility.,5,2017/12/31
1,REDACTED,en,22,"Fantastic all round. Will go back. Shuttle fabulous although the walk to Shinjuku is about the same - great location. Happy, dedicated staff who are professional and lovely people. For the high prices you pay anywhere in this area of Tokyo, the Hilton was definitely the best choice.",5,2017/12/31
1,REDACTED,en,23,"With so many great options to choose from in a massive city like Tokyo, this hotel is a great option. From its newly remodeled rooms, to its convenient location to vibrant Shinjuku, and direct train access, it’s a winner for sure!

My opinion is also based on the fact that we had a lovely good sized suite with a decent view and nicely appointed. While the bathtub was small and deep the shower made up for it. The sliding door between the bedroom and living room also made it comfortable and more private for us traveling with our kid.

We had access to the Executive Lounge which always proves useful for less crowded breakfasts, lunch snacks (which we were never around for) and pre-dinner drinks and light food which was great though we were rarely back early enough to truly utilize this.

The amenities were all good including the pool, spa and gym.

There is one absolutely massive downside to the hotel and that is undoubtedly it restaurants, which while they seem to be very nice, the prices are simply outrageous and unjustifiable. We ended up eating outside of the hotel and on several occasions at competing properties which offered equally good options and normal prices. 

An extra appreciation to Kasano the duty manager when we checked in who was exceptional, accommodating and went the extra mile to ensure we had a great stay.",5,2017/12/31
1,REDACTED,en,24,"The room was clean. Bathroom was really small. I stayed with my family ( 2 Adult,1 Youth, 1 6yr old ). We were given 2 single beds. Housekeeping took 58 seconds to respond to my call. The front desk people could speak fluent English.",4,2017/12/30

Good job !

1,REDACTED,en,28,"I stayed here for two nights on business. First impression was “uh oh - this is a zoo” as the lobby was very busy. However, don’t worry as soon as you approach the desk, calm, friendliness and efficiency take over and from then on the experience was completely perfect.

The front desk was helpful and friendly. I was upgraded to a room with executive lounge access (Hilton Honors) and allowed to check in early. The executive lounge was perfect with a great view of Fuji San. It was a lovely place to work, with nice food. I noticed that it was also great with kids.

If you are able to get Executive Lounge access, breakfast is stunning - either a nice buffet or an incredible full Japanese breakfast.

If you don’t get Executive Lounge access no matter as there is a very nice lobby lounge (good hot chocolate) and a wide number of very good restaurants and bar. I visited the cocktail bar, which was cozy and stylish. There is a good gym, with the usual equipment and some I hadn’t seen before.

The hotel is in the Skyscraper district of Shinjuku. I got lost in Shinjuku the first time, although there is a free shuttle to the hotel that I could have used. Shinjuku is crazy .... but amazing. The hotel is in the “relatively quiet” part.

Excellent hotel in Tokyo. Good place to stay on business but would be more than happy to stay there on vacation too.

Location for the hotel is good and you can access the Maranouchi underground line from hotel. Shinjuku station is a short walk away. Lots to see an do around the station especially on the east side. Added bonus is shuttle that runs from the station to the hotel - very handy when hauling baggage.

It's certainly a popular hotel, especially around the holidays, and one of the managers told me they are booked almost full through 2020 (as per the upcoming sports events and Olympics). So as it is recommended, know that you'll need to book in advance (including one of the dining rooms, seems to be a popular place for locals to have a nice meal).

1,REDACTED,en,41,"This is a large and busy hotel with crowds everywhere and at all times of day. If you're looking for omotenashi, then this is definitely not the place where you can find it. If you wish to remain anonymous and feel like you are nothing but a room number, then this is the perfect place for you.

I was assigned one of the rooms that were not renovated and it was dark and dated, nothing like the photos on their website. Breakfast in the main restaurant had great variety but the hostesses always wore sour faces and didn't seem very happy to see us. The service staff was much nicer but service was just as awful, it was clear that they were shorthanded. If you have access, then breakfast in the Executive Lounge is the way to go, way more peaceful and not that much difference in selection and variety. Japanese breakfast at Junisoh was a great experience too, definitely a must try if you have access.

Executive Lounge was another disappointment. Service during Breakfast hours was great and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Came the afternoon and evening though, it felt like a completely different place. It was an absolute madhouse every evening with increasingly boisterous crowds. I didn't get what the draw was since the offerings were very poor for Asian standards. The staff also seemed to have given up trying to provide any kind of basic service in the evenings.

Thankfully, the hotel does provide a special private lounge down the hall from the main lounge to qualified guests. The staff didn't proactively advertise about the existence of this private lounge though, even to qualified guests, so make sure to ask the staff about it if you are qualified.

Overall the whole experience was very underwhelming. I will not recommend the hotel unless you are a Gold or Diamond Hilton Honors member for which you will get additional benefits. For everyone else, I imagine there are much better options for this price point.",3,2017/12/16

We also got good guidance for transportation arrangements to some of the scenic spots and an onsen hotel in Gunma. This is very helpful. 

Despite there was a miscommunication in our booking to Sushiyanashi Jiro Honten in Ginza, we were able to enjoy the sushi dinner coupled with a little surprise gift from Sato san and her follow-up when we returned to the hotel that evening. We appreciate your efforts.

One improvement is the glass shield in the bath tube which caused a big problem whenever we have shower, the water kept flowing from the bottom of the shield (where there is a gap between the glass and the bath tube) onto the floor. And the size of the glass shield is just 1/3 of the length of the bath tube that would not work as effective as a shower curtain, water just splashed onto the floor as I moved around during shower.

The hotel got provide free shuttle bus to shinjuke station, and Toei and marunouchi line just under the hotel which easy for us to travel in tokyo, and limo bus stop right in front hotel which is very helpful for us go to airport.

only problem is the breakfast option is variant, but everyday is same variant, it will getting bored when you stay longer time at there but overall is still good.

Will definitely come back.

1,REDACTED,en,49,"Stayed here for a week at The beginning of December on leisure and can highly recommend the Hilton Shinjuku as a solid choice in Tokyo for business or leisure. Located in the business district, they provide an efficient complimentary bus shuttle to Shinjuku station every 20 minutes, which is also walking distance and where you will find a vast array of restaurants and shops.

I emailed my room preferences and requests in advance and everything was taken care of by the guest relations manager Ernesto swiftly. He was extremely helpful and reassuring. I booked an executive suite and would definitely recommend going with an executive room or suite, the benefits are certainly worth the extra. The executive lounge serves a great breakfast and afternoon tea. The evening fare is good too, yes not as much of a spread of food as other Hilton lounges in Asia, but they have an ample selection of drinks and the canapes are constantly replenished. It's the staff though that set this lounge apart from others, they were all so polite, kind and courteous at all times. Nothing ever seemed too much trouble. I was blown away when my suitcase broke on my check out date, the lounge manager Keynon went above and beyond, he took care of everything and personally went and got it repaired for me. Such caring and genuine service is rare to find in this industry. In fact the whole team in the executive lounge; Tsukuda, Makoto and Chihiro are all a huge asset to this establishment. The views of Tokyo from the lounge were stunning and mesmerising.

Facilities at the hotel were excellent, from the vast array of restaurants and bars (choices to suit all tastes) to the well equipped gym and fitness facilities. Breakfast in the marble restaurant was always a pleasure and catered to all tastes.

Every single member staff I encountered was polite and spoke English or tired to help. From concierge to housekeeping nothing ever seemed too much trouble.

The room had all the amenities one would expect and was a decent size, complimentary Wi-Fi (which was excellent throughout the property), tea/coffee, large TV with English channels, a safe and plenty of storage space. The bathroom wasn't huge but served it's purpose.

I look forward to returning and would recommend staying at the Hilton Shinjuku without hesitation. It really was a home away from home.",5,2017/12/07

1,REDACTED,en,53,"Hilton Tokyo is a very busy hotel with lots of crowd at all time. 

The hotel room is rather spacious for Tokyo standard but sadly they do not provide different choices of pillows for guests to choose.

Only deluxe room provide standing shower and bathtub separately. For the standard room they only provide one bathtub with half glasses covered standing shower. The bathroom is pretty small for Standard room. 

The water pressure is very strong but the water pipe might be too light which cannot hold it properly the water will keep spinning at the different direction. I have raised my concern to the management to get it fixed but it didn’t do a good job. This would be the most disappointing experience I have in my room. 

The hair dryer is very weak. I would highly recommended ladies to bring your own hair dryer especially if you have Long thick hair. 

The hotel location is not exactly close to the shopping area, need at least a 15 to 25 mins walk. There is no 24 hours convenient store like Seven Eleven, Family Mart or Lawson around the hotel area. They do provide free shuttle bus between hotel and Shinjuku Station with limited timetable availability. 

They have direct limousine bus between airport to Hilton Tokyo, due to the high demand please do book the return limousine bus ticket upon check in.

1,REDACTED,en,54,"Hilton is never a low-end choice, but never expecting a low-cost option. If you are willing to pay more for a wonderful experience, try the occasional promotion for the Executive Suites, in particular where you can enjoy the fabulous Executive Lounge. Free access to the executive lounge situated at 37/F is an exceptionally value-added service. For westerners and wine-lovers, the choice of wine is more than expected. For budgeted travelers, the food is more than expected. But for tired tourists, the opening hours is disappointing (closes at 9pm). Despite the hotel provides free shuttle bus to the city centre (as it is a bit remote in terms of walking distance and that there is no shops around), usually couldn't return to hotel before 9pm if you were a tourist in Tokyo shopping here and there. Yet the overall experience is wonderful and worth a stay.",5,2017/12/04
1,REDACTED,en,55,Tokyo was the most amazing place - off the scale - so much to enjoy there. The hotel was in the main hotel dsictrict and close to Shinjuku Station which is an experience all of its own. The rooms are smaller than you get in Kyoto or Osaka but the place makes up for that. Our hotel had a Tennis court on floor 5 and a full gym and pool. the breakfast - you couldnt ask for more choice. Staff were really helpful when we need their help. they knew lots of places to go.

Thank you everyone and everything.",5,2017/12/01
1,REDACTED,en,57,"While it's definitely not a bad stay and I would recommend it to the right type of people, there's small things with room for improvement. It's Hilton, it's not cheap, my expectations are gonna be higher than if I was at a small budget hotel in the city.

The pros: 
-Large rooms by Japanese standards. Great for families or your American grandparents visiting Asia for the first time. If you still think their rooms look small you need to go to Four Seasons or Peninsula in Tokyo and I'm not being sarcastic.

-All the amenities/services from a big brand hotel: gym, pool, sauna, different restaurants, a team of concierge. Everyone spoke great English, had no problem with communication. They also sell the day passes for Tokyo Subway at concierge.

-Direct access to underground for the subway, or there's 3 shuttle/hour to JR Shinjuku train station. Many people complain about this hotel not being near Shinjuku JR. Note that there are no big roomy hotels near Shinjuku JR. It's either nice spacious rooms here, or you're walking distance to the JR station but staying in a small cramped room. This is as close as you can get to it for this type of hotel. Personally as a tourist I prefer getting around Tokyo using subway vs JR whenever possible, since they offer a foreigner day pass at 800/yen day which is a fantastic deal.

-Airport Limousine stop onsite. When you are going home with bags and bags of stuff you bought you don't need to stress about how you're gonna get on the train to the airport. Also great if you want zero hassle with getting to hotel from airport.

-Beds were very comfortable, great view of the city lights. Good closet/wardrobe space for storing things.

The cons/room for improvement:
-Amenities are not bad but lacking compared to its neighbor Hyatt Regency. Across the street at Hyatt they have a convenience service that'll deliver anything from humidifiers, charging cables, down to bath salts, nail clippers and skin care products to your room free. Hilton offers no skincare products, had a nice bathtub but no bath salts (only shower gel). No coffee machine and only instant coffee mix, I find that unacceptable at this price range. Tea selection not very thoughtful seems random. So the rooms look nice on the Internet, but once I was inside the room all these small things started popping up which detracted from the experience.

-Wifi is free only if you sign up for their membership. I understand the membership is free, but still this is a hassle, just give me the password and let me get on the internet. It's 2017, not all of us are traveling on business and can charge to our company so stop nickel and diming people.

-I wish the shuttle ran until 11 p.m. With the amount of activities at night in Shinjuku it would be a very nice touch to extend the hours a little.

Overall it's still a good hotel, I still recommend this place to families or people looking for a comfortable stay. Also, if you are a Hilton regular/have rewards points then stay here. I hate to say it, but Hyatt Regency across the street offers everything here and a little more for about the same price. If I were to stay in Shinjuku again I'll most likely choose Hyatt Regency over Hilton unless there's improvements, sorry :/",3,2017/12/01
1,REDACTED,en,58,"Hotel concierge was very responsive. When we arrived there, concierge directly walk and help us to check in. It was an early morning around 10.40 when reception was full for guests to check out. One guy stand in reception came out from reception counter and offer a help to proceed my room. 
Room was clean and tidy. Stay at 26th floor where you can see the city with xmas decoration down there. 
The hotel offers free shuttle to and from train st to hotel area. Easy access from tokyo JR lines shinjuku to the hotel building.
Behind the hotel, there is one train station called Nishi-Shinjuku (if am nt wrong) which can be reached by 1.5 mins walk. So conviniwnt to access. It stop at tokyo station as well which eneasy us to access shinkansen train.

1,REDACTED,en,64,"I had booked an Executive Room for 5 nights in mid November ( I have Hilton Hhonors gold). Check in was quick and was given 2224 ( the executive lounge was on the 37th floor). Although my profile requests a room away from the elevators , the room was right across the hall from the elevator lobby but I did not hear any noise.
The room was large, quiet and well equipped with night and a cafetiere as well as ordinary instant coffee.
Two aspects of the room design slightly disappointed me;
(1) a lack of drawer space and located under the tv and by the door entrance
(2) poor design of the bathroom. Although the bath/shower wet room was huge as the door opened outwards towards the wc you had to virtually step out into the hallway then close the shower door to access the sink

The Executive lounge was excellent with excellent and friendly staff. Breakfast was excellent with a fresh orange juice machine and a made to order omelette station. The lounge has two views one towards Shinjuku and one facing towards Mt Fuji (which you can see on a clear day)
Afternoon tea was excellent with a great range of sandwiches cakes and snacks and evening drinks were good also.
The fitness centre and pool were excellent ( on the 5th floor)
There is a convenience store in the Hiltopia complex accessible via the basement of the hotel.
The hotel is about a 10-15min walk from Shinjuku station ( shuttle bus available from 8am) and is close to the Shinjuku city park and the Metropolitan Tokyo Govt buildings ( two free observation decks in the north & south towers.
There is a Limousine bus to Narita airport ( first bus at 520am) I took the 550am bus and was at T2 Narita at 725am.

It rivals the experiences I have had in Hilton properties in London, Rome and Istanbul. I loved it! The people are kind and we all know the employees make or break the hospitality industry. 

I would like to recognize Ernesto in the guest service department for going above and beyond to make my award stay as a diamond member seamless, unforgettable, fun, and every other positive adjective imaginable. He not only recognized my diamond status from the moment I arrived, but fully explained all of the wonderful and unique features of the Hilton Tokyo. He encouraged me to sign up for the traditional Japanese breakfast, upgraded me to a penthouse level tower suite on the 38th floor (yes, you read that right!), hand delivered my luggage to my room, drew me a map complete with subway instructions, shopping recommendations and even found me a great spot to eat dinner. He is a fantastic employee who deserves to be recognized for his efforts. He goes above and beyond in every guest encounter. Even in the 10 minutes I stood with him he held the elevator door for guests, asked everyone around them how he could help, and had a huge smile on his face.

(4 blocks) We were told at the information desk to buy a subway ticket at the machine for Tokyo station (but you don't need to) At the ticket office, next door) we got the tickets for the subway (rail train) and bullet train together (and she refunded our subway far that we had just bought). We bought reserved seats on the bullet train so we could sit together but what we didn't realize is that made us commit to the departure time from Kyoto. ($500rt). You can do non-reserved seats for the bullet train for about $12 less. You aren't committed to a time/train but you might not sit together. We spent 20 min (typing translating on an iPad) to actually figure all this out and buy the tickets because we were unfamiliar and language barrier) Even then we made it from the hotel to Tokyo station (and bullet train) in about an hour. We should of asked for a window seat though because she gave us a center and aisle seat and you can't change seats once you board or pay without a fee. The subway (rail train) ride to Tokyo station is only 18 min). We asked a nice man on the subway how to find our way to the bullet train and he decided to escort us (saved us a ton of time).

The busy city center is approximately 1 kilometer walking distance from the hotel, which was a nice stroll to see the older parts of Shinjuku. 
The morning breakfast buffet was quite nice, offering sushi all the way to french toast and strawberry smoothies. Omelette bar and impeccable staff make the breakfast a must.

The St. Georges Bar on the first floor has a gorgeous setting and a very talented bartender.

1,REDACTED,en,95,"The Hilton Tokyo is a gem of a hotel. During our 5 nights stay we enjoyed every minute in the hotel. The rooms (we had booked 2 rooms) were large, not only by Japanese standards. The interior is well-maintained and looked after meticulously. The Executive Lounge comes second after the Lounge in Berlin, Germany, concerning service, choices, general layout, comfort. In the St. George's Bar with its excellent drinks and live entertainment you are about to forget the time. Breakfast is busy, but again marvellously managed by the entire service, from being promptly seated to constantly refilling items. Hilton Tokyo - highly recommended.",5,2017/11/10

The staff are incredibly helpful and the hotel itself is extremely well-appointed. We were fortunate enough to stay in the Executive Tower Suite for a week, and we are now having trouble re-adjusting to our regular lives! Being able to start everyday in the hotel's Sento (in the fitness centre) was nuts! Hot bath, cold bath, sauna, cold bath! The most amazing hangover remedy ever. The breakfast was overwhelming in its size and choice, and open till 10:30-11am which is, again, really great for a hangover (don't judge, we were on holiday). Get the breakfast if you can. The St Georges Bar do incredible martinis, which is a great way to start the evening, then you can head to the Nishi-Shinjuku metro station from an underpass inside the lobby and start working on tomorrow's hangover. Perfect! Cannot wait to come back here. A really memorable stay.",5,2017/11/06

The other issue was with mixed messages from the concierge and front desk. One said just ask for a large taxi when we were checking out to depart to Kyoto.

Fortunately, our stay at the Tokyo Hilton was a bright spot. First plus is the hotel's location. From Haneda airport, we took the Friendly airport limousine which deposited us right at the Hilton's doorstep. The hotel staff greeted us warmly and we were checked in at a reasonable time. The room was adequate in size and while smaller than other rooms in other countries, keep in mind this is Tokyo where space is a premium. We found their gym fullyequipped with treadmills, statio bikes, cardio machines, and a small pool and made use of them on a daily basis. We did not have an opportunity to eat at the hotel but enjoyed the nearby districts' eating places which are numerous. I also appreciated the staff's help in booking our Hakone-Mt Fuji tour and reservation with the airport limousine back to the airport at the end of our trip. For our transport, we had a choice of taking the subway which had an at the hotel or a shuttle which will take you to the Shinjuku station. Form these points, you are connected to almost anywhere. Btw, we got the bundle transport from the airport which had roundtrip bus plus 72 hour subway use which cost us about 3500 yen.

1,REDACTED,en,109,"I had the chance to stay here for a few days and the hotel was very good. I say very good instead of excellent because of the staff. While they weren't rude or even impolite, they just seem very impersonal. They were hard to find at the restaurants and they always seemed busy instead of attending to the guests. If you like for them to stay away, then this would be great, but for a 5 star hotel I would expect the service to be the best. I have stayed in another Hilton in Japan and they always had a smile and seemed happy that you were staying at their hotel.

Other than they, the hotel room was excellent, the bathroom was a bit dated, but otherwise it was spacious. There were several English channels, which the other Hilton did not have. The breakfast buffet was very good.

And like others have said, the transportation options were great. There was a bus to the airport, Shinjuku station was a 10 minute walk and they had a shuttle to go there was well. The area was near to restaurants and bars.

1,REDACTED,en,113,"We recently visited Japan for two weeks first with a tour group and second by ourselves touring the country for a week after. We really enjoyed the country and after the 12th day in Japan, it was great to end our vacation at this property. First and foremost, while the language was an issue in most of the local hotels, at the Hilton, we were able to speak and communicate fluently in English... happiness! The location of this property is fantastic as we were close to the heartbeat of Tokyo...Shinjuku. Shopping, restaurants, shows, and most importantly, the Tokyo metro station was a stones throw from the hotel. While the lights and action of Shinjuku would have been enough adrenaline to keep you 
awake, the hotel was nicely placed in a quiet neighborhood far enough away so that when you did retire for the evening, it was a peaceful sleep. 

What was great about the hotel was the friendly staff and the room which was at the standard of what we were used to. A king size bed instead of the traditional Japanese setup of two twin beds. Views were amazing and the decor of the hotel was in line with what one would expect in a great city as Tokyo was. The complimentary shuttle transported those that wanted to get to the shopping district fast, but with the great facilities for pedestrians in Tokyo, we walked everywhere. The Tokyo metro station is connected to the hotel which was very convenient. When our stay was over we boarded a shuttle bus that took us directly to the airport without ever leaving the property.

1,REDACTED,en,114,"Stayed 3 nights in October on the 31st floor, in a King Executive room. 

Narita to hotel: The airport limousine took about 1.5 hours to arrive at the hotel. Usually it should take 2 hours but perhaps the traffic was light due to Typhoon Lan. 

Location: A 5-minute shuttle bus ride to Shinjuku station. Last bus leaves at 9.40pm from Shinjuku. Frequency is every 20 minutes.

Room design: Modern and chic. Absolutely won't disappoint! Nice unblocked city view.

Room amenities: For some reason, there is no bath robe?! And there is no complimentary WiFi, which is puzzling for an expensive hotel. 

Bathroom: Small but unique design. Water pressure is good. Generous with bathing set, which is from Crabtree & Evelyn.

Sleep quality: Excellent! The room is very quiet and the mattress firmly supports your body. Pillow height is just right, and did not give me any neck ache (which is common for cheaper pillows).

Service experience of staff: Top notch service! Staff are definitely well-trained to be courteous, respectful, proactive and helpful. All speak good English. 

Overall rating: Highly recommend!",5,2017/10/26

-free use of gym, sauna and Japanese bath
-quite clean

Cons
- noisy lobby
-Tried to try the Japanese bath but it’s a turn off. we suppose not to wear anything in ofuro but 2 Mandarin speaking women wearing their underwear and bra for the bath and sauna which made me very uncomfortable and they left some garbage at shower area.

The hotel is lovley, has a nice welcoming feel, staff are very pleasant, speak a variety of international languages. Check in was very simple and easy. 

Room is well appointed - fantastically comfy bed. All spotlessly clean. Bathroom was an interesting japanese/European thing going on, I did enjoy the deep bath, Great to have a soak! 

We had club lounge access which was worthwhile as (alcoholic) drinks in hotels are damn expensive, was also lovley to see tokyo from up high as it was getting dark.

Breakfast in the ground floor restaurant (I can’t remember it’s name) was very good.. quite busy but a constant supply of very fresh produce.

We had access to the executive lounge which was a great way to start your night as they had drink and light snacks available.

Yes the wi-if access is bit disappointing but you can use the freely sth the lounge and lobby areas. But access to free wi-if in japan isn’t too hard when most places are free. 

The buffet breakfast was delightful! Definitely one of the best waffles and French toasts I’ve ever had! The breakfast was extensive with western and Japanese cuisines and should cater for most people. 

The hotel gym had a good range of equipment available and was well spaced out. We didn’t get to use the pool or tennis courts but they looked pretty good. 

The hotel provides a free shuttle bus to Shinjuku - ask for the schedule at check in and the hotel is the last airport bus stop too.

1,REDACTED,en,120,"I booked Hilton Tokyo for the last 3 days of a two week holiday as I wanted to stay somewhere special for my birthday but I was disappointed. I made the mistake of booking through a third party agent (they had a good deal) - this meant that I was not eligible for free wifi in my room as Hilton only offers this to members of their HHonors program and only if you book directly through the hotel. The daily charge for standard wifi is 1000 yen. 

They do offer free wifi in the lobby if you can be bothered going down there - a lot of guests hang around (probably the ones that were not eligible for free wifi in their rooms).

The day before we were due to check out, I called the guest services hotline to ask the best way to get to Shinjuku Station so we could catch the Narita Express train to the airport but was told that the only way to get there was to walk (I thought this was strange, as I knew there was a free shuttle bus from the Hilton to Shinjuku but thought maybe we weren’t allowed to take luggage on the shuttle). On my way out, I asked the concierge desk to double check and they said we could take the free shuttle even with our luggage. Not sure why the information is inconsistent. 

It is also not conveniently located if you want to stay out late. While it is connected to Nishi-Shinjuku station, there is only one subway line passes through here and the walkway closes at around 10pm, which means if you want to get to other parts of Tokyo you’ll have to make a few transfers. 

The rooms are clean and quite spacious, but I didn’t feel like a valued guest here. There are other, more conveniently located and better value for money hotels in Tokyo. 

Had I known all of this, I probably would have booked elsewhere.",2,2017/10/22

I was sick on the day of my departure and I asked one of the staffs at the executive lounge for the nearest pharmacy from the hotel and the staff suddenly took pen and paper and noted down my symptom in Japanese without me having to ask for it, so I was able to just show it to the pharmacist and I got the medicine I wanted. 

However, there was one concern that I particularly disliked is that the hotel did not have a turndown service, despite staying at their top suite category. I kinda expected something more especially when you are paying for USD 800 a night, perhaps a personalized welcome greetings / special amenities, which would certainly create a much memorable impression for us. Definitely, a turndown service should be implemented!",4,2017/10/22

You could tell that it was a business hotel given the surrounding neighborhood. We were greeted by Fukuda san at check in. She was very nice and professional. She was able to upgrade our room to the Executive Class in which we never expected even though I’m a Hilton Honors Gold Member. Not to mention that she paid full attention to when we were departing and was able to get us a late check out since we were departing later at night and use of the executive lounge to relax in. She was able to book our shuttle as well. Fukuda san was spot on! Probably the best check in I ever experienced and I travel quite a bit! The room we arrived in was a chic renovated room which was awesome! The size of the room was smaller than Odaiba but we didn’t mind. The executive lounge was a great experience!

Or if your going to north end of Shinjuku you can walk it in 10 to 15 min
The room was immaculate, breakfast buffet was a great selection and fresh 
The concierge was very helpful

First day to recover 
Second day we used a local walking tour guide for 4 hrs who showed us how the trains and subways work and took us around local areas that made the rest of trip much easier as we didn’t look like confused rabbits trying to navigate the local transport system 

Wifi I used japan wireless service which was fantastic : cheap , no data cap : lasted about 10-12 hrs

From the hotel, you can walk to a number of places of interests (e.g. the Observatory at the Government Office, the Shinjuku shopping area or train stations). However, there is a hotel shuttle bus that takes you to the key spot in Shinjuku. This makes your stay all the more pleasant. And if you get in very late like we did, besides their room service, there is also a well stocked 24-Hour convenience store in the basement level.

Hotel is amazing and truly recommend. A little pricey but worth every dollar, or should I say YEN :-). Luckily we got the 50% off deal which made it affordable 
We booked the King Jr Suite with Executive lounge
The room was very spacious and open and very clean. The staff were kind enough to provide a rollaway bed for our 5yr old so we were very thankful
The shower in the bathroom had a glass leading into the bedroom so there was plenty of light and made it an open room for those who don’t like dark spaces

We had buffet brekky daily and the spread was quite diverse. We travelled with two families and we all agreed that the omelette station was the best by far. They made it so moist and yummy that no other hotel compares. I would spend every morning studying on how the chef was preparing it as my wife has basically told me that I need to prepare the omelettes this way from now on 

Unfortunately Hilton Tokyo was our first stay for a 3 week trek through Japan and we couldn’t seem to compare any of the hotels to this one. On my return trip, I will ensure to book Hilton Tokyo last to have something to look forward to

Well done to the staff and the management as this is truly one of the best stays in a 5 star hotel if not the best I have encountered

After plenty of walking during the day, I need massage to refresh and recharge myself or else I could not sustain days of happy trotting every day. The massage services available in the hotel were well managed, in professional hands, and with good value for money.

The hotel's convenient location allowed me to take the underground very easily, and the hotel had shuttle bus to Shinjuku Station. Limousine bus to the airport made it most convenient for travellers, and gave us certainty and comfort on the way from airport to hotel and vice versa.

1,REDACTED,en,137,"My husband and I checked in on Thursday for a 3 night stay. The 1 star is for the helpful concierge and decent breakfast. However, that is where the good points end. We booked our hotel room through an online agent, Japan-Ican. My husband is a Hilton Honors gold member and when we tried to register his membership number to the room, we were told that since we booked through an agent, showing his card has no effect. Meaning that his patronage would not even be acknowledged. I can understand that no points may be counted, but to acknowledge a paid visit would seem to be appropriate if the hotel would like to establish any long-term relationship with it's loyal guests. Further disappointment came when we requested to extend check-out time from the usual 12pm to 2pm. Again, we are told that due to the booking being made through an agent, that the request will not be entertained. That is perhaps the worst and most absurd reason to refuse late check-out. So the hotel wants to make it clear that it doesn't like us or any other customers for booking through an agent. If you don't like agents, then don't sell your rooms through them. Why compromise good service and act in such a petty manner? This will be the very last time that we patronize this establishment or any of it's chain hotels. We don't like places that don't appreciate our business.",1,2017/10/14
1,REDACTED,en,138,"We were excited to stay here on our last night in Tokyo and spent quite a bit of money (by our standards) to splash out in a 5 star hotel....we were very disappointed!
We checked in at 3.10pm and were told that our room was not ready and that we were getting an upgrade. Not sure what our original booking would have looked like but when we arrived in our 'upgraded' room we were disappointed to find it was tiny, drab and tired. We were perplexed as to how they were going to fit an extra bed in also (there were only two in the room and a third was supposedly being sent up right away). We were forced to go out and look around shinjuku (although we wanted to sleep) as the third bed never eventuated. 7 hours later at 10.30pm it was still not there, at which point we enquired as to where it was - we then still waited another half an hour for this mysterious bed to arrive, which it finally did 8 hours after we checked in. It was shoved into the only remaining spare space and the only chair in the room was taken away, leaving no room for bags or to walk around. 

Service was slow, internet was only free on the 1st and 2nd floor of the hotel which is unheard of in this day and age.

Would definitely not bother staying here in the future - there are much cheaper and better quality hotels!",1,2017/10/13
1,REDACTED,en,139,"Located in the happening area of Tokyo, called Shinjuku, this hotel offers large comfortable rooms with excellent service.
It is a 5 minutes walk to Shinjuku train station and also a five minutes walk to the happening geisha area with glittering lights and large billboards, giving it a real feel of a city hotel.

Rooms are large and very comfortable and modern with all the facilities that one can imagine. Room service is available 24 hrs.

It also has many restaurants with many cuisines to choose from. Breakfast has a very large spread from Western to Japanese breakfast. Omlette station can give your choice of egg white omlettes and if you are a vegetarian tbey can take care of you.

Shinjuku is the area to stay in as it is centrally located and is like 20 minutes to most of the sites to visit in Tokyo.

Check in referred me to the concierge team and they checked with train station and reported it to the police. I got all squared away and by the time I got to the police station, they had already found it. This experience and my interactions with the Hilton - Tokyo staff made me fall in love with Japanese culture and people. My room and Lounge access also made for a pleasurable experience.",5,2017/10/11

1,REDACTED,en,143,"I booked a three night stay in the Hilton sale and my only disappointment with this hotel was that I was not able to stay longer!

I arrived at the hotel after a protracted flight early in the morning and as with the majority of hotels, I was aware that the official check in time was 3 pm, and I was really hoping that I could check in early.

I arrived at check in and the gentleman who was operating the reception/check in area could not have been more helpful.

It would have been so easy for him to confirm that check in was not until the afternoon, but he checked through his system for a while to not only find me a room, but due to my Hilton Honors status, I was upgraded to a suite. This was way beyond my expectations as I would have been quite happy to have been allocated my standard club room that I paid for.

The location is excellent and having been made aware of the shuttle to the station, I always walked the relatively short distance that enabled me to explore the surrounding area.

The room itself was spacious, clean and very comfortable - particularly the bed.

What I also discovered was that the staff throughout the hotel were amazing. Nothing was too much trouble, and everyone seemed to speak excellent English - and also understand my North East England accent!

I had lounge access and again, the staff who serviced it were really good and exceptionally helpful.

Due to my limited time in Tokyo, my sightseeing schedule was a little hectic and the exec lounge was a great place to chill after a hectic day.

My brief time at the Hilton was made more exceptional by the staff who work there and factoring in the other aspects of the hotel such as rooms and other public areas, I would have no hesitation in staying here again and I would certainly recommend this property to anyone considering visiting this magnificent city.",5,2017/10/09

1,REDACTED,en,146,"From the moment we arrived we experienced excellent service. 

The shuttle bus from the station was perfect and was much better that dragging our bags with us.

The check in process was simple and a room upgrade was a lovely surprise. The room was much bigger than I expected (after reading how small Tokyo rooms generally are) and had some lovely inclusions such as a nespresso machine and bottled water.

The executive lounge was worth the extra cost and a perfect place to relax after a long day of touring. The breakfast was delicious especially the omelettes!

The were sad to leave, but the check out process was simple and the staff continently organised for our bags to be delivered to Kyoto. 

The staff overall could have not done more for us and were fabulous with our children.

If we return to Tokyo, we would be sure to return.

1,REDACTED,en,148,"My hotel was chosen by the company I was visiting so I did not have a choice but I would not change a thing! From the moment I arrived on the bus from the airport I was totally pampered and made to feel like visiting royalty. I can honestly say that this Hilton is the best Hilton that I have visited. I was on one of the executive floors so had access to the lounge and all its features. Boy was that great and everyone was so helpful. I needed to print some papers and asked for directions to the computer room. The girl at the desk in the lounge said she would take care of it if I allowed her. She took my USB and printed everything perfectly. All I had to do was sit around and be waited on. No problem at all! Whatever I needed was available or obtained. 

The staff at the Hilton are all so helpful and knowledgeable. I cannot say enough good things about them. If you want a place to make you feel like you are the long-awaited royalty visiting this is the place to go. They are perfect. The beds are sumptuous and luxurious. The bath is spectacular! I did not ask for a view but I understand that the room with the mountain views are great also. I will ask for that my next visit but I will definitely be back again and again. Thank you everyone at Hilton Tokyo! You made my business trip feel like a vacation.

1,REDACTED,en,150,My husband and I stayed at the Hilton Tokyo for 2 nights. I'm so glad we booked this hotel as our first 2 nights in Japan. We had jet lag pretty bad and woke up at 2 am unable to go back to sleep. So we went to the gym very early. The Hilton has an amazing gym that was open 24 hours. We also got breakfast with our room and it was a great buffet with both western and Japanese items. We upgraded our room to higher floor and it was modern and quiet. Very nice base for exploring Tokyo and fighting jet lag.,5,2017/10/04
1,REDACTED,en,151,"I have been staying at this hotel since it first opened in the early 1980s and it has never let me down. In fact, between all of my stays during the 1980s, the 1990s, and into the 2000s, I am certain that I have spend more than one year of my life living at this hotel. So, that lets you know my overall feelings about his establishment.

This hotel is very nice and it is easy to get to from Narita International Airport (NRT). There is direct limousine bus and they drop you off right in front of the hotel. Then, the bell men quickly grab your bags for you.

The front desk staff is always nice. Checking in is easy and there is always a very nice person who escorts you to your room. 

Though it is not really customary to tip in Japan, (as some employees find this offensive), this is a Western hotel chain and it seems that the staff have become accustomed to tipping. Though it is not required, my recommendation is to give the bell man somewhere in the neighborhood of five-hundred to one-thousand Yen. They always smile and they never turn it down.

The rooms are always great at this hotel and well maintained. If they do not give you a room on one of the higher floors when you check in, my suggestion is to ask for one as this hotel provides you with some great views of Tokyo and beyond. You can even get a view of Fujiyama if you are on the right side of the hotel.

More than just a place to stay, this hotel has a few very good restaurant, a nice bar, and a fun shopping arcade on its basement level. Check them out. It will be worth your time.

This hotel is located just a few blocks from Shinjuku Station, so getting around Tokyo and beyond is very easy. It is also just a few blocks from the Shinjuku entertainment district. So, again, you are close to having something fun to do. Take a walk, that is one of the best things to do in Tokyo! You never know what you will find.

Whether it is for one night, one week, or longer, this Hilton is always my first choice for hotels in Tokyo.

Great location. Great service. Highly Recommended !!!",5,2017/10/04

But the best part was the customer service, the people from the front door to the front desk and housekeeping were so incredibly kind and caring! While your room is very quiet and peaceful the downstairs often had live music and just feels like a really fun happening place to be!

1,REDACTED,en,155,"While significantly less expensive than its neighbor, the popular Park Hyatt hotel made famous in the movie ""Lost in Translation,"" the Hilton Tokyo doesn’t stint on comfort, aesthetics, or service. I had Visa troubles here in Korea where I live and found myself planning a last-minute trip to Tokyo for an overnight trip and arrived during a typhoon, but my frazzled nerves were instantly soothed when I stepped through the doors of the Hilton. The entryway air is laced with some softly sweet fragrance (rose maybe?) and I found myself relaxing right away. The lobby is spacious and grand but also divided into smaller areas in a way that prevents that “Grand Central Station” feeling you get in so many corporate hotel chains. All the service I encountered was exceptional, from the warm and efficient check-in and check-out, to the bell desk, room service, guest services, executive lounge breakfast, to the the doorman (actually a woman) who called me a taxi when I departed. My room was beautiful, spacious, and had some nice design touches like the fact that you could see through the shower/tub room’s glass walls from the sink to the bedroom and out the window beyond. Of course there were screens you could close for privacy, but I was traveling alone and loved the sense of light and airiness. The bed was super comfortable (and I’m super picky about my beds!), the room was perfectly soundproofed and the room had all the amenities - tea kettle, TV, steam iron, etc. It’s a short, beautiful walk to either Shinjuku station (and all the amazing shopping and dining around there) or a relaxing, leafy green park with a lovely Shinto shrine in it. Its a slightly longer walk (20 minutes maybe?) to the Meiji Jinto and Shrine, which is a must-see on any visitor’s itinerary. If you keep walking through THAT you find yourself in Harajuku where the shopping and people watching is second-to-none. Absolutely perfect location! I will definitely be back!",5,2017/10/02

If you follow signs for the Tokyo government building, that gets you on a nice underground pathway most of the way. 

As a gold member, we had lounge access and this is one of the best hotel lounges I've ever seen. The evening hors d'oeuvres were fine, but the breakfast was just fantastic. Maybe it was the jet lag, but we loved it every single morning. They do made to order omelets, plus a seemingly never-ending buffet of both western and Japanese food.

Plus:
Nice room

Friendly airport limousine service pick up outside the hotel
Shuttle service to Shinjuku train station
Lounge had nice champagne

Minus:
Location for us was not great and having to depend on shuttle was a bit annoying for us (we stayed in other hotels in more convenient locations for your liking)

Lounge.. where to start.. it wars VERY CROWDED at pretty much all times we were there and of course at major times like breakfast, afternoon tea and happy hour. At one stage we were turned away and had to go to our room until they called us when there was a free table. Breakfast was very busy and hectic.

The food offerings was crap for vegetarians or anyone with any specific dietary requirements. Very poor labeling as so often. But I do expect different from an international hotel. 
There was hardly any food for vegetarians (again, international hotel.) also e.g. At breakfast the cheese was in the same box as the salmon, which is a big no no as people who are not considerate would use the same serving device for cheese and salmon. I tend to use my own fork and pick cheese from the very back, hoping it has not been touched by meat/fish serving devices.

Hotel restaurant and bar were soooo expensive. I know it's the area but honestly. Usd 14 for a small beer??? That is just a rip off. Btw there is always beer available in the lounge, not just at happy hour

There's a few restaurants in the underground, one is an Indian which does the usual veg option and they speAk English, also a Starbucks is round the corner fro the hotel. 

Would we stay here again, probably not.. 

Lounge hours
Breakfast till 10

The executive floor lounge had great variety for food and drinks. I wish there more typical items like sushi. It would be difficult to beat this place,",4,2017/09/13
1,REDACTED,en,190,"Looking for a hotel that would work well for business and leisure I booked this hotel based on reviews inc on TripAdvisor. It was/is a great choice as I here now.

From arrival and check in the servoce has been imaculate and generous, the restaurant are some of the best I have seen in any hotel in the world and very popular with Tokyo locals, especially the themed afternoon teas where people come in theme dresss. Speaking with the German Exec Chef Thomas they serve some 400 afternoon teas per day. 

Pool, gym, Exec lounge all good and exceptionally well connected to the Tokyo subway/metro",4,2017/09/13
1,REDACTED,en,191,"A very good three night stay whilst in Tokyo. The Hotel is in a very handy location for all facilities, the hotels free shuttle bus, which runs like clockwork, can have you in the City Centre within minutes . We had a Club Room which was in excellent condition and allowed us access to the Club lounge, a great facility for breakfast, afternoon Tea and Pre dinner drinks and refreshments. The hotel hosts a number of good restaurants and eatery's well worth a look. In all the hotel was very good value for money.
The only downside to my stay and is a warning to others using a Qantas Cash card for payment is: I had the local currency ""Yen"" loaded for payment on my card to pay the bill, I obtained my bill in Yen and payed in full. However this Hotel Group prefer to be payed in US dollars and their system through Mastercard took the other currency's ie US and Australian dollars out of my card instead of the Yen I had authorized, this leaving me with only the Yen for my next bill in another country.
Check fully before you leave, as it is a nightmare after. I have since cut my Qantas Card up.",5,2017/09/11

Anyway, we stayed here at the beginning and end of out tour and the service from start to finish was excellent. We used the limo bus from Haneda airport which was convenient and as to be expected in Japan, very efficient. Check-in was rapid with our room being made available before out allocated time. One thing I can highly recommend is the Japanese breakfast, this requires booking in advance but was absolutely delicious.",5,2017/09/10

Well, this hotel is a knockout from the food to the more than friendly service from the wonderful staff. We were booked to leave on Green Tomato and the service when leaving was just as good in leaving as arriving. Breakfast was probably the best we had in all Japan and we stayed at quite a few hotels.Rooms were well appointed and beds very comfortable. The only bit of a pain, it is located in the heart of the business district and had to either get the free shuttle (every 20mins) or get a cab. The shuttle ran like clockwork and was not a real hassle.",5,2017/09/08
1,REDACTED,en,196,"We had a great 2 night stay at the hotel on our 8th time to Tokyo. Location was great, an easy 5 minute walk from Tochomae and Nishi-Shinjuku metro stations and a 15 minute walk from the hustle and bustle of Shinjuku. The surroundings were quiet but we had plenty of options for food and drinks in the area a short walk away. 
Service in the hotel was good and prompt and staff spoke English well so no issues with language barriers there. Gym was well equipped with an adjacent indoor pool and we had a great view with a quiet room on the 18th floor. 
Only negative was that third party sites were offering better rates than the Hilton site, otherwise no other issues that we could think of. Would stay there again the next time round.",5,2017/09/07
1,REDACTED,en,197,"This is one of the best hotels I have stayed, since the service is great, the facility is well maintained and the cleanliness is impeccable. It is a fancy hotel, which is quite expensive, but it was so comfortable staying there. My wife and me stayed for a 7 days and would stay there again.
This hotel is closer to the Haneda airport, than the Narita Airport. It has convenient location to use the metro that gets you anywhere in the city.

Its perfect situated quite centrally and provides good walking access to a lot of popular destinations, such the city, and shops and off course good restaurants, the Shinjuku subway station is only a 3 minute walk. The check in was charming and the room was spacious and comfortable with a very comfortable bed, with a nice bathroom. The view was amazing from our 22nd floor, and off course the fitness area was sensational, with a 2 lane lap pool, spa, sauna, and fitness room, all you wanted to keep fit. Generous Breakfast buffet on offer had an incredible range of dishes, both Japanese style and Western. The staff where extremely helpful and friendly, could not do enough for us. This is one of the best hotel in Tokyo. I would absolutely stay here again because of its location and quality for the price. Have no hesitations to recommend to our friends.",5,2017/09/02
1,REDACTED,en,200,"Our one night stay here was awesome. The room was clean, the beds really comfortable, nice bathroom.We had a great view from 22nd floor. If anything is wrong with your stay they will try to fix it, even the zipper on my case! The staff are amongst the best I have encountered anywhere. The fitness area was great, with a 2 lane lap pool, spa( very hot), sauna, fitness room. Breakfast buffet had an incredible range of dishes, both Japanese style and Western. If travelling there I would recommend the easy 3 minute walk from nishi-Shinjuku subway station rather than the much larger and busier Shinjuku. There are shuttles to both airports, reasonably priced. If you want a quiet area, there is a nice park nearby with a small waterfall, turtles, beautiful chiming bells, flowers, very peaceful. Highly recommended hotel!",5,2017/09/01
1,REDACTED,en,201,"The hotel is situated less than 10 minutes away from Shinjuku Station (worlds busiest). With a free shuttle bus from the station (west exit in front of Keio Department Store) to the hotel was a great advantage. 

Arriving at the hotel, staff were friendly and made check-in a breeze. Hotel in general was beautiful with a great atmosphere.

Our room on the 30th floor was immaculate and gave us a great view of the hotels surrounding.

We booked from JAPANiCAN.com which was a lot cheaper than through Hiltons own website.

Definitely recommend if your looking for a great place to stay with great food in Tokyo.

We were offered free upgrade to a Jr. Suite.

1,REDACTED,en,205,"My girlfriend and I had a great stay at the Hilton Tokyo. The hotel is very clean with lots of amenities. What stuck out to me the most was how the staff went out of their way to ensure our stay was as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. The concierge desk especially was extremely helpful in making restaurant reservations prior to our arrival, recommending restaurants during our stay, and even making phone calls to a pharmacy at 5am to ensure the pharmacist understood which medicine I needed when I arrived at the store. I highly recommend this hotel!!",5,2017/08/26

It is in an awesome location and has a nice bus that you can take to Shinjuku, though it is a pleasant 25 min or so walk to the area. lots of great food and things to do in the area. my only issue was with the lounge it was always very crowded, and even the ""diamond"" lounge was very crowded. but this is a petty gripe. The hotel and staff are awesome and I will definitely be back.",4,2017/08/25
1,REDACTED,en,208,"I was in Tokyo by the end of May and I spent 5 nights at this Hilton property. In short it was an excellent stay. The hotel is well located, just a short walk to the public transport and Shinjuku Station (a shuttle bus is also available) and also part of the Limousine Bus Stops from Narita. Modern, efficient and clean. The staff is wonderful: always ready to help with a smile and the right tip. For those with an Executive Room, check-in and check-out formalities can be arranged in the executive lounge on the 38th Floor. The room was very well kept and very cleans, the bed very comfy and the view amazing. The lounge provides excellent refreshments and great breakfast (egg dishes are cooked on demand and served at your table) with a breathtaking panorama on the surrounding skyline. The Pub downstairs is a nice meeting point with live music and a nice selection of drinks, the steakhouse was nice with an impressive setting though I had better steaks to be honest.
A gym is also part of the establishment as well as a PC corner
Thanks to the Japanese hospitality my stay was just perfect; I felt safe and well looked after. I will definitely be back again when in town and with no doubt I can recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2017/08/25

Airport Limousine bus dropped us at the hotel. Breakfast was amazing. Nothing to complaint, we will come back",5,2017/08/21
1,REDACTED,en,213,"The Hilton Tokyo places a decisive emphasis on guest experience. From the moment you are greeted at the curb to the day you bid farewell, you and your experience of the property is the staff's top priority.

Rooms are well appointed in an understated and tasteful way. The desks are spacious for work and have good lighting. Bedding is lush and the pillows are very good. The washrooms are fantastic (as one would expect in Japan) featuring a Toto Washlet, a lively shower and a deep, relaxing tub.

The cocktail lounge on the hotel mezzanine is not its strong suit, but there is so much else to do in Tokyo that you shouldn't be spending all your time in the hotel anyway. Although, I would suggest a few nice drinks in St-George's Bar in the lobby - it's quite an interior design experience.

Before heading out for a night on the city, pop by and see the nattily clad concierges for recommendations and hand written notes that you can show your cab driver so that you get to your destination (and back to the Hilton!)

You'll be sad to say goodbye to the warm and friendly staff at the Tokyo Hilton, but if they've done their job right (and in my experience they always do) you'll surely be back again soon.",4,2017/08/20
1,REDACTED,en,214,"When i started my visit to Japan. I was scared by everyone that its very expensive. Yes it is of you are not wise! I was wise and got Hilton Tokyo a bit at higher cost. But then be wise and search for more options. You will get many budget luxurious hotels in good price. Eat wise and travel wise and you save money for sure. Hilton was really nice to me.

Japan is a country full of enthusiasm and colors.",4,2017/08/20

- Some of the furniture looked a bit outdated.",4,2017/08/18
1,REDACTED,en,217,"We had a really good stay here !Our son lives here and works nearby so he could come for dinner out with us several times. We had a BIG room on the 36th floor with a wonderful view, enormous bed,slept great each night!The only thing I could fault in the room is not loads of space.This would not bother me ,but we stayed a long 10 days. I do not think most folks stay that long just in Tokyo itself.Eyeland across the street had loads of restaurants, the hgotel has a shuttle to the Shinjuku Train station that takes 5 minutes to get there, and next to that are worlds of department stores.The weather was horrible(August always is) but the room was cool and refreshing. I used the pool and that was great too. Staff is friendly. The breakfast is probably the best I have ever had in a Hilton,which are always good!
The only things I was not crazy about were in the lobby. It is a huge hotel and huge lobby,and there are 9 bench seats and one chair.People do not sit here after shopping or have a visit.Some friends came for me and we had to go directly out in the heat.The other thing was the super lemony tea smell in the lobby, like a beauty parlor hair spray in the 50s.. Horrible. Rooms had no smell,thank heavens,LOL.My husband went to a conference for 5 days a couple blocks away, perfect easy walk.",5,2017/08/17
1,REDACTED,en,218,"My family and I stayed here for three nights on a quick vacation. It was technically a layover as we were moving home, and we decided to stretch the layover into three nights to allow for sightseeing and to stretch our legs before the long flight home.

I booked this hotel online with our Hilton Honors membership, which is free to join. With Hilton Honors you get free in-room wi-fi. 

The cost for three nights are in a King Deluxe room, advance pay (no refunds or cancellations), with breakfast, was 126,302.90 Japanese Yen, which was about $1,139 USD. That comes to about $380 per night. I generally refuse to pay this much for hotels. However, I figured Tokyo is in general an expensive city, and I wanted something comfortable and easy. 

I looked into many options to get from Narita Airport to the Hilton and settled on the Airport Limousine Bus. I was concerned about how to reserve these tickets in advance, but I ended up just getting off the airplane, going though customs, getting my baggage, and getting in the line at the Airport Limousine Bus counter. There are three counters in Terminal 1, two counters in Terminal 2, and one counter in Terminal 3. There is also one counter at Haneda Airport. It was easy to find the counter. I simply stood in line and bought the tickets on the spot. I had also been concerned that there wouldn't be enough seats on the bus and we would have to wait around for a later bus, but that didn't happen. I bought the tickets around 4:05 pm for the 4:30 pm bus, which gave us enough time to use the restroom, buy some snacks at the convenience store, and wait in line outside for the bus and get our baggage tagged. We had six pieces of luggage plus a stroller which is why I opted for the bus over the train. The bus goes directly from the airport to the door of the Hilton Tokyo (with a few other stops in Shinjuku, the area where the Hilton is located). It was very convenient. One round-trip ticket is 4,500 Yen. I bought a round-trip Narita ticket combined with a 72 hour subway ticket (on all Tokyo Metro and Toni Subway Lines) for 6,000 Yen. I also bought a ticket for my toddler because of how much baggage we had (I think the bus permits 2 pieces of baggage per person), although she could have sat in my lap at no cost. Going to the Hilton the ride took 1.5 hours. Going to the airport took 2 hours (45 minutes of that was picking up passengers at other stops in Shinjuku). I would definitely take the airport bus again if I had a lot of baggage or wanted an alternative to navigating the train/metro upon arrival. 

Check in was easy. I had purchased baseball tickets in advance and the tickets were safely with the concierge. I had a room request that I made in the online reservation and it was remembered. The Hilton check in representative even gave my toddler a little bag with a coloring book, crayons, a child's toothbrush and toothpaste, and slippers. 

There are six elevators that serve rooms on about 37 floors, so the elevator lobby is always busy and sometimes you have to wait for a second elevator. 

Our room was on the tenth floor. There was no special view. The view from the window was of some nondescript buildings. The Crabtree & Evelyn Verebena & Lavender toiletries were a lovely touch. The windows had a Japanese type sliding cover, and for black out purposes there was an even heavier shade to slide over the windows. I appreciated both shades and used both quite a bit. There were disposable white slippers, an iron with a cute plastic cover, fresh white bath towels, and two bottled waters replaced at no charge each day. The bed was comfortable. The room is small by western standards, but I was still able to fit 5 large pieces of luggage, a stroller, and set up my toddler's pack and play in the corner. It was a tight fit but we managed. 

The Hilton is in a good spot for taking the subway. I was intimidated just looking at the subway map, so every morning I would first check with the Hilton concierge regarding my route, and they were all friendly, clear and helpful. We took the subway to Roppongi (four stops away from Shinjuku station on the red Marunouchi line) for lunch one day at the Grand Hyatt to eat Kobe steak. We took the subway and JR train to Chiba, where we watched a baseball game (we passed Disneyland to get to Chiba and saw Cinderella's castle from the train window). In the hotel lobby, you can take the escalator down one level and walk via an underground walkway to the Nishi-Shinjuku subway station. This is how we got to Tokyo Station (about 10 stops away on the red Marunouchi line), which is where we caught the JR Keiyo line. We walked to Shinjuku station one morning to explore. 

Taxis are not cheap in Tokyo but they are convenient. We've been spoiled by low cost Uber in Southeast Asia. But taxis in Tokyo are safe and clean. The doors even open automatically- just stand/sit there and the driver will press a button to open your door. We took taxis to two restaurants in Roppongi. We took a taxi to a batting cage one morning.I also took the taxi to Shinjuku station (the Keio Department store) one morning when I was in a rush to buy some last minute souvenirs before our flight (less than 1,000 yen). I also took a taxi to the Tokyu Hands store which is next to Takashimaya for souvenir shopping. It was fun walking back to the Hilton at night because the air was cool and the streets were busy and there were lots of shops and restaurants to pass. 

There is a 24 hour mini supermarket about a 3 minute walk from the hotel. There is also a nice park about a 2 minute walk from the hotel. At the park's southern end there is a children's playground. It's a further walk to the playground and we only stayed for about 30 minutes because the cicadas in the summer are so very loud (loudest insect in the world).

Breakfast was filled with options but always very busy. It runs until 10:30 am. There is an omelette station which always had a line, many types of breads, pancakes, French toast, juices, fresh kale juice, smoothies, soymilk, fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, an assortment of Japanese breakfast items including salted salmon, and some Chinese breakfast items.

I would absolutely stay here again assuming I had the resources. It's convenient location, cleanliness and the friendly staff make it a comfortable choice.",4,2017/08/16
1,REDACTED,en,219,"We stayed here as a family whilst I was on a business trip and we really enjoyed the hotel. We were able to check in early and our room was well appointed and relatively spacious (most hotel rooms in Japan are on the small side but this was quite big).

The hotel is very handy for both Tochomae and Nishi Shinjuku underground stations, though you can get a free shuttle bus which runs every 20 minutes from the western side of Shinjuku Station (and wasn't particularly well advertised anywhere). From either station you can actually remain underground as you walk to the hotel, which is a bonus in the heat of the summer.

I walked west, into the more residential area of Shinjuku, and found lots of nice places to eat and a supermarket - as well as a really good, 24h, coin laundry, which has a nice Indian restaurant next door. 

We enjoyed the huge selection available at breakfast, but didn't eat in the hotel otherwise.

Would stay here again.",5,2017/08/15
1,REDACTED,en,220,For a Hilton I'm very disappointed. Most my make up and bathroom necessities had to be on the floor as the entire bathroom was the size of a toilet cubicle in an airport.

1,REDACTED,en,234,"It was my first stay at a Hilton in Japan (2 more Hiltons to visit within Japan this week) and was pleasantly surprised when I was given an upgrade from my plain jane king hilton reserved room to their largest corner suite room.

It really pays to be a diamond member here, and will continue to stay at this hotel for my future visits here.

Kudos to the front reception team that still managed to welcome me with the warmest smile when I checked in near midnight.",5,2017/08/07
1,REDACTED,en,235,"For a chain hotel this place was head and shoulders better than anything I expected and the norm.

Staff throughout were first class, friendly and professional across the board.

I was lucky enough to be in a suite and space was very good, comfortable bed, plenty of sockets and if needed iron and ironing board. Bathroom great, water pressure in the shower really fierce, toilet seat something to sit and ponder on.

I also used the lounge and breakfast offerings very, very good.

Direct bus to the door from Narita Airport.

I expected a normal Hilton experience and was very pleasantly surprised.",5,2017/08/03

1,REDACTED,en,238,"How often do you find a hotel in Tokyo that gives you a 5 class experience on your 3-4 class budget? Not often. Perhaps never. Hilton Tokyo did just that. It delivered and then some. Having stayed all over the world and experiencing so many different tourist destinations, it is not often that our family decides to forego a trip or delay the start of a tour or rush back early from a day of exhausting sightseeing to get back to our beloved hotel. But this was the case here. The executive junior room with the breakfast included for 8 days and 7 nights was pure bliss. The room was spacious and oh so clean! And those remarkable Hilton beds. Sinking into it at the end of a hot summer day in Tokyo was exactly what the doctor ordered. The next morning we would rush to the marble lounge for breakfast. My kids who never wake up early did so for this hotel's amazing breakfast. And did I mention the subway is attached to the hotel?! Attached!! From that subway we traveled like true Tokyo natives all over the city and even to Kyoto! Want to shop when it's raining outside? Don't worry. Hilton Tokyo has you covered literally. They not only have the subway metro right under your nose but they also offer complimentary shuttle buses to Shinjuku, a thriving shopping district. My husband and I woke up early each morning for the marvelous gym(food in Tokyo can add up to those calories!) and my family so enjoyed the pool. Every request we had and every whim was granted. And the concierge was perhaps the best I have ever experienced. Especially Sato. She gave us the best restaurant recommendations and they were spot on every time. 
All in all, we would never stay anywhere else. Hilton Tokyo- you are a winner in this family's eyes!",5,2017/08/02
1,REDACTED,en,239,"I had a pleasant one night stay.
Well appointed rooms. Decent size...everything you need is available.

It is a very busy place. Make extra time for everything you do because there will be a line: elevators may be full, breakfast is packed and check in/out will add 10 minutes to any tight schedule.

I did enjoy the bar downstairs- St.George Bar was open until midnight and offered nice drinks and cigars while watching a small band. Good way to top off a busy day.

It's about a 20 min walk from the train station depending where you exit. I took a cab once and it took about as long.

Would consider staying again but there are other options as good and maybe a touch closer to other activities and the train station.",4,2017/08/01
1,REDACTED,en,240,"We stayed at the twin executive junior suite for 3 nights. The extra bed was comfortable enough, although it was placed at a rather awkward position. The room is nice and we enjoyed the access to the executive lounge.....for drinks....and a little afternoon tea....and of course the view. We loved the special Japanese breakfast as well as the huge buffet breakfast selection at the lobby. Checking-in at the lobby was swift. And checking-out at the lounge was even better. The hotel has a regular shuttle bus to Shinjuku station. Just that the bus was very crowded, especially if you happened to be there for the weekend, since the bus is not reserved strictly for hotel staying guests only. We realized that many Japanese take the bus to the hotel for its restaurants and events. Fortunately, there are 2 subway stations within walking distance. The hotel was so busy during the weekend, there was even a need to queue for the lifts....and taking the lift was like taking the subway during peak hours.....not very nice when being pushed from behind! Good stay overall but we would definitely prefer a quieter hotel.",4,2017/08/01
1,REDACTED,en,241,"I stay here every year with my family. This time for 8 days. Staff as usual is super professional and helpful. Quality of the rooms and overall hotel is always on point. I stay at Hilton brand hotels around 4 months out of the year and this is one of if not the best one that I've come across on my travels. In a dreamworld, only change I would suggest is getting rid of the tennis courts and making it a heated outdoor pool. This would make the hotel a worldwide destination. Current pool simply too small for that size of a hotel.",5,2017/08/01
1,REDACTED,en,242,"This is a great base when staying in Tokyo. There is a link walkway underneath the hotel building which takes you to the subway, which we used all the time. The hotel also runs a courtesy bus to and from the centre of shinjuku (about 10 minute walk), which is another great service.
We had breakfast everyday in the hotel. There is a massive selection of foods from all over the world and the quality of food is very good.
We stayed in a standard room which was a reasonable size.
The staff are really lovely, especially those working at the concerceige desk who go out of their way to help organise trips, make restaurant reservations and offer advice regarding getting around and seeing Tokyo.",4,2017/08/01
1,REDACTED,en,243,The hotel is strategically located.It is near MRT stations and walking distance to the Shinjuku shopping district. The lobby is big and smells good.

1,REDACTED,en,244,"The Tokyo Hilton is a full service hotel in one of the business areas in Tokyo. It is very clean, the rooms are quite comfortable, and the services complete. The staff are extremely helpful and responsive. The lobby restaurant was quite good, with a morning buffet (that was included in our rooms) and full service menu at other times. The meeting spaces on the third and fourth floors were excellent. The gym and facilities on the fifth floor were well appointed. The only criticism I have is not one that is under their control, but the hotel is designed such that the lobby is quite crowded at all times, so there is not really a relaxed, quiet feel to the place. In fact, there were almost always lines to check in or out or lines to get into the first floor lounge restaurant. I would stay here again and do recommend it.",4,2017/07/30
1,REDACTED,en,245,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights for a conference in June, the hotel is huge and the staff were nice, but the location is a bit away from the main Shinjuku station and no shops or restaurants nearby. There were shuttle bus pickup at the subway station every 20 mins and took about 10 mins to the hotel, but there was always a long queue waiting for the bus, so be there as early as possible. Or you can walk to hotel for about 20 mins. 

Asked for a nicer view but overlooking at the hospital next door. The room itself was huge, the bed was comfy and everything was functional, but the down side was that you have to pay for the in-room wifi or you have to register for the Hilton Honor membership in order to get free wifi. The breakfast buffet was good, with many varieties but almost the same every day. Will stay at other hotels that are closer to the tourist attractions next time.",4,2017/07/27

1,REDACTED,en,247,"Right in the hub of Shinjuku but on a side street and has this tranquility regardless of being in the centre of a huge metropolis. As always with Japanese establishment, super-efficient. The airport shuttle starts for the hotel which is very convenient. Guests from nearby hotels need to trek to the Hilton with luggage to get on shuttles. Restaurants are very expensive but numerous eating places within walking distance where one can get value for money meals. Rooms are nice, usual Hilton standard.
Whilst the lobby area was massive, there was no seating for guests apart from s small sofa with a seating capacity of around six, inadequate for such a large hotel. Maybe it is to encourage guests to go to the lobby restaurant.",4,2017/07/26

1,REDACTED,en,250,"Hilton hotel in Tokyo made me really upset! 

Main Issue; Credit Card charges procedure and blockage. Food and Beverage.

They charged me US 508 extra upon checking out and they did not use the blocked amount made from reservation office which was also US 508.
The most frustrating part is that upon checking out I was actually talking to the front desk agent and she confirmed that she will use the blocked amount to complete the transition. She charged me the balance and gave me the receipt.
Just 5 minute after I left, she made a NEW transition and charged me again US 508 without providing a receipt.
In the end I have to wait 15 days for the amount to be released

Metropolitan Grill.
Menu does not match the actual dishes served, the Cob Salad was actually a duck appetizer 
Cesar salad was shocking and pork ribs uneatable.
I had to call for extra Champagne and extra bread.
Terrible service.
Paid ¥ 51.000 - what a crime, no value for money at all.

The hotel was full with organize leisure group mixing with business and families like us, breakfast was not an experience but more like an Olympic run to get the food, we walk out.

My wife met a friend in the lobby after a very long time. They could not get tea or coffee and once the waitress finally reached the table the service was really bad. 

While I was checking out, a polite manager in the lobby asked me how was my stay, I try to explain but there was way too many issue....

1,REDACTED,en,251,"We stayed at this hotel twice. The first leg of our journey was for five nights and for our last night in Japan. We stayed in an Executive King with an extra bed brought in. This is part of the reason for the loss of a star. It seemed as if adding the bed was to accommodate us, a family of three and not for comfort. The extra bed made the room cramped and uncomfortable to enjoy the spacious seating provided. All magazines and welcome info was only in Japanese. Secondly the bathroom. It was very small. To get out if the shower you needed to skirt around the toilet and the door opened out into the bathroom dripping water onto the floor. The bathroom garbage pail required a foot to depress a petal to open. It was awkward.
The beds were very comfortable and the amenities were well stocked. The robes and pajamas were a welcomed comfort. The cleaning staff did a wonderful job.
We had access to the executive lounge on the 37th floor enabling us to have breakfast there or on the first floor. The benefit to this was it was open all day to us to enjoy light snacks all day. Plus you could enjoy beer, wine or other spirits free between 5-8pm. 
On the last leg of our trip they extended our check out for us and additionally allowed us to use the lounge until our taxi arrived.
The staff was very pleasant compared to what other viewers mentioned. We only received top notch service.",4,2017/07/23

When we arrived at the Hotel, the manager congratulated us on our wedding and he upgraded to a higher class room and added breakfast for us at no extra charge which was a very nice thing to do! Other hotels dont really bother. The room was very nice and spacious with a lovely view. The bathroom and the whole room were very clean! We love this hotel and will be coming back to it next week!",5,2017/07/21
1,REDACTED,en,255,"We opted to get a suite and am glad that we did so as the room was excellent except that the bathroom was too small. The AC was cold and the beds were very good.

This hotel is extremely busy, so much movement in & out of the hotel. Elevators took very long and breakfast lines were long. Glad that there is an executive lounge as an option.

First time I ever encountered a hotel not assisting in booking a taxi to the airport without them getting a commission. We asked the concierge to book a taxi with our preferred taxi company for the day of departure to Haneda airport. They cannot do this as it is against their policy and they can only book for 13,000 yen for a van. (It only cost us 8,500yen from Haneda to the airport with bumper to bumper traffic in the tunnel so I basically knew it shouldn't couldn't cost any more than this) Likewise, as I frequent Tokyo; I've never encountered a hotel on failing to assist in booking them as I need their help due to the language barrier. In the end, lo and behold there is UBER now available in Tokyo. For 8,100 yen was able to get an alphard van and excellent service.",3,2017/07/20

The hotel offers shuttle buses to Shinjuku station as well as the airport, but book early as they filled up. There are some interesting breakfast and meal options, but we opted to go elsewhere downtown. We did not get the room we had booked - a room with a top floor view - and were disappointed with the one we got. Make sure to double check the room you get is the one you paid for. Overall, we enjoyed the other Hilton in Tokyo, near the Rainbow Bridge, better.",4,2017/07/20

A pool is a must when it is hot outside and it was Nice to go and have a swim after a long Day of sightseeing. The conciegers were helpful and recommened a brilliant sushi place for us where we Got to experience a Real Friday Night out at a lokal sushi place. 

The breakfast is good and we loved the doormen who always were super kind. 

Thx for a Nice stay",4,2017/07/19
1,REDACTED,en,260,"Centrally located in Shinjuku - it's an easy 10min walk to the shopping distance, and Shinjuku station. 

We found that the concierge's knowledge was not entirely up to date - we were told that it was 'impossible' to buy a JR Rail pass in Japan, yet upon hitting the station, we found out that it was actually possible.

However - master chef in the executive lounge fries possibly the best eggs you'll ever have. He's the older one of the three we saw on rotation during our stay, and most mornings, we waited until he was on station to get our daily eggs. 

Staff were friendly and helpful.",4,2017/07/18

1,REDACTED,en,262,"We stayed for 8 nights in the King Executive Junior Suite at the end of our 3.5 week holiday in Japan. What a marvellous way to end our trip! The service was top of the class from the very moment we stepped into the property, someone pointed us up to the executive lounge on the 37th floor to pick up our room key cards as online check-in was already done the day before. The staff were all very courteous and most helpful and never failed to greet you warmly. There was a good selection on the buffet breakfast at the Marble Lounge. There was also an option of breakfast at the executive lounge and Japanese breakfast at Junisoh, the Japanese restaurant. Needless to say, we really appreciated all the extra space in the bedroom (44sqm). The room and furnishing looks new except for a few minor brown stains on the carpet. There is a free shuttle bus to/from Shinjuku Station. It tends to get quite crowded coming from Shinjuku Station because the hotel runs many special lunch/afternoon tea promotions. There were one or two occasions where we almost couldn't get on the bus. The hotel could possibly consider utilising a bus with a larger capacity during anticipated busy hours. 
Alternatively, it is a pleasant 3-5 minute walk underground to the nearest metro/subway station from the hotel. The Airport Limousine Bus for both Haneda and Narita also come to this hotel which makes it really convenient especially if you have a lot of luggage.
On a slightly negative note, there are 6 lifts that service 38 floors on this property and they get very busy during peak hours. Imagine trying to get down from one of the higher floors, in a very full lift and stopping at every other floor. 
And the swimming pool was rather small and nondescript for such a big hotel but who comes to Tokyo to swim right? 
In summary, the Hilton is an excellent hotel with impeccable customer service. We would definitely come back when we visit Tokyo again.",5,2017/07/18

From check in to check out everything about this hotel was excellent.

My husband is a diamond member so we were lucky enough to get upgraded and our suite was spacious and boasted fantastic views. The room was clean, well maintained and all the amenities we needed.

It is located approximately 10-15 minute walk from Shinjuku station and we found it easy enough to navigate around. Recommend trying some restaurants nearby or in neighbouring areas.

My husband enjoyed the pool area, though on the smaller size.

The executive lounge was one of the best we have encountered in the many Hilton hotels we've stayed in.

We decided to try the Japanese breakfast which we thoroughly enjoyed.

The breakfast buffet was great, as was room service. The Japanese bath and sauna were dreamy. The only caution I would offer is that this is a very international experience. If you were looking for something authentically Japanese, this won't be it. But if you are looking for a highly comfortable place to stay in Tokyo, I recommend it.",5,2017/07/15

1,REDACTED,en,270,"Stayed in a King Deluxe room for 5 nights with our 3 year old. This was by far the best and largest room we had in travelling to six cities in Japan. It was a good size and all amenities were provided – including a little pack of toiletries and bedroom slippers for my child. The hotel is in a great location! Conveniently located across the street from a lovely park (Shinjuku Chuo), if children are in need of a good run around. Although the hotel is in Shinjuku, it is actually closer to the business district (‘Skyscraper City’) and away from the bright lights and craziness of the station area. The hotel is also connected via subway to Nishi Shinjuku station, which is on the Maranouchi line, so you can avoid Shinjuku station if necessary and the Airport Limo bus will drop you right at the doorstep. Also the Metropolitan Government Offices, which are right across the street, have a fantastic observatory with free entry offering wonderful views of Tokyo.

Breakfast is excellent – the chefs at the egg station in particular are so impressive at multitasking and making fantastic omelettes. Great variety of Western and Japanese food – we would often skip lunch from being so full from breakfast. The concierge was also very helpful in forwarding our luggage to Kyoto and directing us to many conveniences around – including a laundromat and chemist. A great stay and good base to explore Tokyo, especially if travelling with kids. Although a business hotel, it suited our needs as a family perfectly.",5,2017/07/14

With scheduled shuttle bus every 20 mins to the Shinjuku Station, the bus ride is around 3-5 minutes. 15-20 mins walk from Shinjuku station which is quite pleasant at night. Also located just across the road, a 4 minute walk will take you to a 24 hour supermart! The airport limousine stops directly at Hilton Tokyo. Landing in Haneda will take you roughly 1hour5mins to get there. Narita would be a 2 hour bus ride. Hotel and Staff - 5/5 The staff were extremely professional and proficient in English. The decor was classy and I love the layout of the room. Simple, business looking and the king size bed would give you the ultimate night's rest. Look no further, ill be back for sure!",5,2017/07/13
1,REDACTED,en,272,"We stayed here for 3 nights in July and had a wonderful visit. The location is very close to Shinjuku station which made traveling around very easy! The hotel room and gym area were very nice and clean. Luckily we were upgraded upon check in and were able to visit the Exec lounge for a free breakfast but if you do not have access here, like our traveling companions, breakfast can be quite expensive ($30 a person). This is mostly a business area so there aren't many options around to opt to for a quick breakfast either. 

Two other notes:
-The cleaning lady came in and cleaned while we were still in the room...I'm not sure if this was a language issue but it was very awkward as we were still dressing and getting ready.

-We asked the hotel for a recommendation to a nice steakhouse for a splurge dinner. Unfortunately, the place they recommended did not speak any English which we found strange for a upscale restaurant. As a result, we had complications with our orders and spent quite a lot of money on food that was only so-so and not exactly what we thought we ordered.",5,2017/07/13
1,REDACTED,en,273,We stayed here for three nights and had a great experience. Good location for the Shinjuku area and very close to the subway station. The area does get a bit dead at night as it is in a very corporate area. The service was excellent during our stay. We only ate here once for the buffet breakfast which was okay and overpriced. The other restaurants also seemed quite overpriced which is to be expected for a big hotel. Overall had a great stay and would stay again.,4,2017/07/13
1,REDACTED,en,274,"Stayed at this property for five nights last month. The Lobby area is very nice, and the rooms are well appointed and clean. The accommodations are not luxurious, the bathroom very basic, but overall the property and rooms are comfortable and well appointed. The service is wonderful; from the front desk to the bar service. I especially want to call attention to the GREAT concierge service. They will help you with literally everything; from directions, to navigating the transportation system, to making reservations for you etc. They go far beyond expectations and go out of their way to get you set up with maps, information so on. Thus definitely make use of their friendly service and help.

I would advise against paying for the included breakfast option. It is a buffet that is something like $30 a person, while the property has several breakfast options within a five minute walk, from a Denny's, to a café called the Royal Host, to a Starbucks. At these locations we would get a full breakfast for three for only around $20 U.S.

The property is in a great location, less then a 10 minute walk from Shinjuku Station, and a 15 minute walk to the center of Shinjuku's daytime shopping and the center of the evening and night activity.

You can't go wrong choosing the Shinjuku Hilton for your stay.",4,2017/07/12
1,REDACTED,en,275,"The Hilton Tokyo was a luxurious stay in Shinjuku. The room was spacious, the bed soft, the staff friendly. 

My favorite parts about the hotel is the assortment of restaurants located on the lower floors and the convenient free shuttle that comes every 20 minutes taking you to or from Shinjuku station to the Hilton. While pricey, the restaurants served fantastic food and was a great dining experience. Choices include a western BBQ place, a Japanese restaurant, and I believe a Chinese restaurant as well, in addition to their dessert shop. The shuttle will quickly take you to Shinjuku station which allows you to essentially travel all over Japan. 

Luxury certainly comes with a price, but it's well worth it. The Hilton Tokyo is highly recommended.",4,2017/07/12

1,REDACTED,en,279,"I was lucky enough to stay at the Hilton Tokyo last week on 2 separate stays, checking out in the middle of the week to experience Mt Fuji.

Upon arrival on the Monday night I was met with friendly service, and was pleasantly surprised to receive my Hhonors gold upgrade to a junior suite, which was very stylish and spacious, complete with mini bar, coffee machine, bath robes, and massive leather sofa. Views out over Nishi (west) Shinjuku, and about 15 minutes walk back to JR Shinjuku although the Maranouchi line has a stop just next to the hotel and can be reached in less than 10 minutes. The hotel has a shuttle bus to ferry you back and forth to the station also. 

The executive lounge on the 37th floor is huge and caters for mainly executive room guests with a separate gold/diamond lounge located on the same floor looking after Hhonors members. We enjoyed the superb service from Waki who hosts the gold/diamond lounge. Both lounges offer a great selection of food, with a chef making omelettes in the main lounge in the morning and supported by friendly English speaking service staff. 

The pool and fitness centre is located on the 5th floor and has a lovely pool, sauna and onsen which is a real treat. The cocktail bar on level two has a nice ambience and had live entertainment when we were there. 

Having been underwhelmed by the Hilton Osaka the week before, I was very impressed with the Hilton Shinjuku. The whole time I stayed at the hotel from check in to Hhonors recognition, to overall service and quality of food/drinks; I was thoroughly delighted with our choice of hotel, which is the best run property I have stayed in for a long time.",5,2017/07/10

The facilities are pristine, I'd mark this as one of if not the best Hilton I've ever visited. While nice facilities are all well and good, the true high marks go to the staff who were some of the best I've encountered. The concierge was beyond patient and helpful, and those who worked in the executive lounge morning and evening were attentive, polite, and truly were the game changer during our stay. Two in particular (Hilton, this is where you take notes and reward them) - Mami (didn't get her surname) who worked the breakfast buffet went above and beyond, recognizing us and customizing service to our preferences each subsequent day. In the afternoons, I didn't get her name, but she attended Temple university and spent 4 months in Philadelphia.. her English could easily pass for a native Californian, and her personable attentiveness and charming conversation made for an outstanding experience as she offered tips on what we might enjoy seeing. All of this at what I felt was a very reasonable rate in a city where there is no limit to what you might spend on a hotel. Thanks Hilton, thanks to your staff and efforts you've earned my business for a long time to come.",5,2017/07/09
1,REDACTED,en,281,"In Tokyo for a night (~16 hours), stayed at the Hilton in Shinjuku to check it out. Was upgraded to an Executive room as a Diamond member. 

Pros: 
- Room was gargantuan and beautifully appointed - separate living room with leather sectional; bedroom with seating area; amazing views. A 5* room. 
- Executive lounge wasn't overwhelmed - food options at breakfast were decent, not spectacular. Would probably try the restaurants instead. For light snack, it was a bit sparse but quiet and comfortable. 
- Of course, the staff was quite welcoming. Got a late checkout. 
- The health club is solid - 24/7 access, decent equipment. Lots of cardio, weight areas are smallish but workable. 
- Proximity to transit - walk to the Hyatt Regency across the street (about 5 minutes) to get to the subway - Shinjuku lines are ~10 minute walk away. Depends what you're carrying and your tolerance for heat. 

Cons
- It was a bit of a nuthouse in the lobby - I thought maybe the pricing would keep out the riff raff, but no such luck. Lots of loud Americans. I'm American, but not loud...if you're looking to get away, then I guess Shinjuku isn't the right place. Have stayed at the Conrad before, which is much more peaceful.",4,2017/07/09
1,REDACTED,en,282,"The hotel was overall a very excellent hotel. Efficient and kind staff, clean hotel, and an incredible buffet. The hotel also hosts many restaurants that will satisfy your hunger, and a breakfast buffet with great staff that will rush at your assistance. Although, the hotel could change the food menus once in awhile, but other than that the food is great. The rooms are absolutely great, my family was fortunate enough to be served by an excellent hotel manager by the name of Ernesto Bressan, a very kind manager that is a hardworker and goes beyond the call of duty. If you have trouble with anything, just ask for him and he'll solve your problems. The maids at the hotel are great and do great jobs cleaning your hotels. The rooms with the views are gorgeous as they show the bustling city of Tokyo. The toilets at the hotel are quite hilarious but get the job done. Cheers to the hotel. I also have to add that when you walk into the hotel, the smell is absolutely fantastic! I can't even explain it in words, it's just so good! The hotel has a gym and a pool. The gym has everything you need, training your biceps and core and such. The pool also has a view of the city and a window on the top of the roof where you can see the sky. The hotel is very convenient and is around many areas such as Tokyo Station (you will be needing this), restaurants that are fantastic, and walking distance to the Metropolitan Government building where you can access the top floor where you can also see Tokyo, free of charge! So, I highly recommend this hotel if you want a clean, efficient, and world class service hotel. You should pick this one. Thank you Hilton Tokyo for your tremendously great service!",5,2017/07/08

We appreciate the generosity of the whole team in arranging the fine touches in making everything nice and perfect for my spouse and I. We also loved the extension of club benefits and the option of the Japanese breakfast for us. It is so good that we had it for both days.

We tried the Junisoh restaurant and the food was heavenly coupled by the extensive selection of drinks. They really surprised us with their Teppanyaki cuisine and you have not tried Japanese food till you have tried the options at the Hilton Tokyo.

The food is delicious (whether you'd like traditional, Japanese or Chinese!) and again, the service was terrific! We stayed for 5 nights and every day explored so much of the city, from this perfect starting point. And then, every night, we returned exhausted from our day and were able to relax in our room and have a wonderful nights' sleep.

1,REDACTED,en,296,"I seldom made a comment for a hotel but I need to do it this time. 

We have been suffering from a nightmare with Hilton Tokyo since 25 Jun. The stay is for a birthday celebration for my beloved sister. We checked in late at night, before our sleep we found the ventilation near the door producing weird and annoying noise. We called the guest service hotline for assistance, a staff arrived and ""instructed"" us to turn the air conditioning to the lowest temperature and then highest temperature, ""the sound may disappear if you don't change the temperature"". It's a known problem for the hotel and we kept doing this for 3 nights already. We still need to stay with such ridiculous problem for 3 more nights which made us sleepless for whole night. 

Besides, the design of bath room was terrible. There's no ventilation inside it that made the floor and everywhere wet and slippery. The glass blocking the bath tub is useless, all water came out to the floor after taking a shower. 

We had stayed at the nearby Hyatt Regency for a week before, the room size and design was much much better than Hilton. I feel regret to have chosen this hotel for such an important trip.",1,2017/06/27

We took the free Hilton shuttle from Keio Plaza at Shinjuku (look for Bus stop 21). Bus driver was helpful with loading my luggage onto the bus. 
When we arrived at the hotel at noon , I was extremely delighted that we were allowed to check-in early instead of waiting till the official checkin at 3 pm.

There was a friendly check-in manager, who spoke excellent English, ushered us to the check-in counter. Check-in was quick and efficient and we were given the room key within minutes. 
As requested, we were given a room on a high floor. Didn’t get a great view as the room faced a nearby hospital. However, the room and bathroom were clean, ample and spacious with nice ambient lighting giving me a nice relaxed feel immediately. Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries are provided. 
We came down for breakfast buffet in the lobby lounge at about 8.15am which appeared to be the peak period. We were quickly shown to our seats. Breakfast buffet consisted of a wide selection of good quality Japanese, Asian, and western cuisine. The only hiccup was the coffee machine that broke down but was quickly rectified. Disposable cups were provided for those who needed an extra cup of caffeine on the go. 

Shuttle buses to/fro Shinjuku train station take about 6 to 8 minutes (depending on traffic conditions) and make their runs every 20 minutes.
Airport access is also convenient with the airport limousine bus stops at the hotel. 

Overall, I found the staff to be pleasant, attentive and approachable – making my short stay a wonderful experience.

Service was excellent, professional and helpful with most staff being able to speak goos english. The concierge was able to make restaurant reservations on ur behalf and would even leave a note under ur room door to let u know once ur table has been secured.

Location wise it is one stop away from the bustling shinjuku main station on the west side meaning that it was convenient yet quiet. There is also a free shuttle to shinjuku west station entrance outside keio department store that departs from the lobby every 20mins.

1,REDACTED,en,313,"We were on our first trip to Japan as a family and I choose the Hilton because it was centrally located in Tokyo and a few blocks away from Shinjuku station. I was able to book two rooms for myself and my wife and our two boys.

We arrived to the hotel by Uber and our luggage was immediately picked up. I went to the check-in counter and noted that I had two rooms. The front desk person noted that I was a gold member of Hilton Honors and asked if I wanted connecting rooms. I agreed, but then he came back and stated that connected rooms were only on the executive rooms. So he upgraded us to Executive level and assigned me two connecting rooms. It was a great way to start off our stay here.

The rooms themselves are very clean. The shower had excellent hot water and pressure. The beds are not too hard, but softer than I would expect for Tokyo. The room also came with a safe that worked as well as slippers. I have to admit that the slippers were pretty flimsy.

We used the Executive lounge a few times and found it often crowded, but they had a good selection of food and drinks. We went early for breakfast and the fresh squeezed orange juice was the best.

Service is also excellent. We always had our questions answered and all our requests were filled. I even asked the Bell hop to ship my luggage to our next hotel in Osaka and as long as I did it the day before we left, it should be there and it was.",5,2017/06/19

Shower facilities excellent and the heated toilet seat is a welcome addition to the comfort of a restroom visit. Beds are somewhat firm, suits me well, but had I travelled with my wife it would have been less than ideal. One wonder if mattresses with different firmness are available within the hotel? Concierge does a good job at helping out with reservations.
Wifi is speedy for normal browsing and very easy to hook up to. Free if you join Hilton loyalty program. TV has among all the Japanese channels, BBC and CNN. Breakfast buffet is well appointed, both western and Asian, with chefs preparing your eggs to your desire. 

The shuttle bus travels every 20 minutes between Shinjuku station (the world’s busiest) and the hotel in less than 10 minutes. The trick is to find the bus first time round. Arriving at Shinjuku station with the Narita Express, our instructions told us to find the West gate, which is not available in the station building you arrive in. One has to exit and move across a wide street to the next station building (green JR sign as well as a Lumine2 sign) where you will find signs for the West gate and Mosaic street. Go for Mosaic street which is a small laneway lined with modern boutiques and coffee shops. Once through, take a left, pass the Rolex store and you will find bus stop 21 were the Hilton shuttle stops every 20 minutes (00, 20, 40). If you don’t want to wait, there is a taxistand by the Rolex store and it is less than 1000 Yen to the Hilton.

The front desk was gracious enough to explain and offered a newly renovated room on a much lower floor. Mr. Ernesto escorted us to our room to ensure we would be satisfied. What great personal service! We were happy and our stay was only for four nights. We ate late dinner at Marble Lounge which is in the lobby. The food was excellent as was each of our breakfast buffet every morning. We also ordered room service one night (It's 24 hour room service) and was pleasantly surprised how fresh and delicious room service was. Our last night we ate dinner at the Marble Lounge buffet. What a treat! It was carved roast beef night. There was also a chocolate fondue with fresh strawberries. We also had Executive Lounge access and the staff is very good. The best customer service in all the Hilton chain. We are planning to return in November. Great location and we return because of the staff.

The bus ride is about 45 m (with jam), and from Haneda, about 1000 yen. (it would be 3100 yen from Narita). Separately, the hotel is 20 min walk away from Shinjuku station, so they provide a free shuttle service for residents. I think the shuttle ends it run at around 9 pm. If you need to take a cab back from Shinjuku after dark (which we did), it cost USD10 for about 4 min of cab ride. (yes, cabs in Japan are expensive). 

Right beside the hotel is a metro station, but I would think the main Shinjuku station is more convenient in getting you around. There is also a convenience stall right below it. We took the shuttle bus back to the airport, and that bus does have limited space for big luggages (maybe around 4 - 5 max).

Great spa at the hotel! Only down side i would say was the language barrier but everything else was great!",5,2017/06/09
1,REDACTED,en,329,"This is a typical Hilton, but very large. Hotel feels a little bit like a cruise ship with tons of people always coming and going in the lobby. Pros: big room, friendly and helpful staff, and convenient to most train lines.

Cons: 10 minute walk to get to the heart of shinjuku and to the main train station; the elevators are frustratingly slow, stopping on nearly every single floor on the way down (we were on floor 30). Everything is wildly overpriced. A cup of coffee cost $10 and an Asahi was $12.",3,2017/06/09
1,REDACTED,en,330,"I am delighted that on our second visit to this property (see my other review from 2015) not only it has maintained its exceedingly high standards, but it became even better thanks to improvements to key areas that Honors members appreciate, such as the Executive Lounge, and the opening of a new and superb Japanese-style bento-like breakfast exprience on the 2nd floor (make sure to book). They really appreciate our loyalty, I wish other Hiltons were like that.

I am still amazed by how wonderfully quiet the rooms are, way better than other Hiltons located in much quieter areas than the middle of this huge and very busy city. Everything smells lovely, tastes good, and is impeccably clean.

Above all, staff continue to push boundaries of figuring out how to please customers. In particular, we had a wonderful welcome and the ongoing care from the Guest Relations Manager, Ernesto, whose beaming smile started our vacation, and whose knowledge of the area, as well as the Hilton itself, made us make the most of our stay. I wish we could have stayed longer, and I cannot wait till we have a chance to return.

Well done, Hilton!",5,2017/06/09
1,REDACTED,en,331,"Fantastic accommodation, rooms are a great size (apposed to the fact Japan is well known for the hotel rooms being small) There is a gorgeous little Jazz bar on the top level of the hotel (absolutely love it) and there are shops bottom level also which the little grocery store is open till a decent time for a night cap ;) the hotel is only a short stroll from Tokyo's busiest district in Shinjuku and I found myself always ending up at the famous Pedestrian Scramble (which was super handy for an easy gauge on location) lost's of places nearby to eat however, there is fantastic restaurant options at the hotel as well. To top it all off, the staff were outstanding and so helpful and friendly. I Highly recommend staying here!!!",5,2017/06/08
1,REDACTED,en,332,"I stayed here for three nights recently on a work trip. This is a great hotel with large rooms for Tokyo, I even had a bath and large wardrobe with lots of hanging space.
There is very reliable wifi and nice breakfast buffet. However dinner prices are very high.
There was also an outdoor BBQ bar which had just opened when we got there. The chaps running it were very friendly and helpful.
My company also used a function room for an event. The set up was very good again with great service.
Watch out for the Airport bus - it took me over two hours to get to Narita. 45 minutes was taken to get around all the stops before we even left the neighbourhood. The bus is much cheaper than a taxi but the Hotel told me we would be one of the last stops and go straight out to the airport. If I had known I would have taken the train or paid for a taxi!
Overall great hotel and I would recommend it.",4,2017/06/08
1,REDACTED,en,333,"I try to stay with Hilton brand whenever traveling, especially overseas, as they always provide a very high quality of service. I chose Hilton Tokyo because of its location and was not disappointed at any level. The location is great and from the very moment I arrived, I felt welcomed. Everybody, and I mean everybody, was always so nice an polite, and trying to be helpful at all times. I really appreciate the amount of work and care they provided to assure that my stay is a memorable one. It sure was. Thank you ALL at Hilton Tokyo!",5,2017/06/08
1,REDACTED,en,334,"We booked a 2 night stay at the Hilton Tokyo during our opening first few nights of a 2 week trip to Japan. We decided to do something less expensive (around $350.00 USD per night) while breaking in our jet lag before jumping up in cost for nicer resorts and ryokans like the Aman, Asaba, Four Seasons Kyoto, and Zaborin in Hokkaido. The Hilton offers a great value for its location and has very clean rooms (which were recently renovated and looked beautiful). Their overall service was very good too. Our only real complaint was that it was the only place we stayed in our entire 2 week trip to Japan that didn't offer free WIFI?! I mean... seriously? Who does that now days? We thought this was a total joke. The hotel charges $10.00 USD per day for basic WIFI, and an astounding $20.00 USD per day for faster WIFI. We simply couldn't wrap our heads around this why any 'nice' hotel in today's age would charge for WIFI. So that was a big ding for us. If it wasn't for everything else that the hotel did well, we would have given this rating an 'average' review.",4,2017/06/07
1,REDACTED,en,335,"This is a fantastic Hilton; the executive floor services are among the best in the Hilton chain. The welcoming, conscientious staff, outstanding breakfast and strategic location (within walking distance of the subway and Shinjuku train hub) made it an ideal choice. Our room had comfy couch seating and a cityscape vista. The “premium” executive lounge was not only a superb spot to unwind after a busy day of sightseeing but a great value.",5,2017/06/07
1,REDACTED,en,336,"Had two stays in two weeks - one with wallpaper coming off ceiling - another one with phones not working. The hotel welcome was formal and not welcoming, concierge overloaded with one staff on duty and in my three approaches always busy. Missed my train due to that queue as I had to return my adaptor and the shuttle left as it wasn't able to wait one more minute despite telling concierge. Breakfast was ok, friendly staff - but very crowded. Will likely not to return - had visited other properties around - name is not everything Hilton! Japan is safe to explore local hotels easily and I felt more welcome as a guest - who could easily choose a Airbnb too :)

Tip: stay as high as possible, ask for renovated rooms - otherwise you have no bedside plugs - central AC only and a bathtub only and no free standing shower.",2,2017/06/06
1,REDACTED,en,337,"It's a very good hotel with a great service. Staffs are very courteous. Because my HHonors profile has no preference for the non-smoking room, the hotel has reserved a smoking room for me. But at the check-in, seeing my kid, the staff asked me if I would wish to change to a non-smoking room. Upon my approval, they assigned a non-smoking room in just a minute.

The hotel is in a great location - 10 minutes walk to Shinjuku station. The hotel also provides shuttle service (every 20 minutes) to and from Shinjuku station. My room had a very nice view of the skyscrapers of Tokyo.

The hotel room is very clean and the bathroom is nice too. Staffs attend to our requests in minutes.",5,2017/06/06

Nice! I'm a swimmer and enjoyed the small lap pool - wish it was longer but you can't have everything. Nice staff and all I encountered speaker at least some English.,5,2017/06/04
1,REDACTED,en,340,"I've stayed at the Hilton Tokyo on several occasions. It's my favorite place to stay especially since I love the Shinjuku area. 

The accommodations are luxurious with excellent service provided by the staff. All team members speak English which is very important to me when planning my sight-seeing trips and asking for directions and other information.

They provide a convenient shuttle to Shinjuku Station near Keio Department Store that runs every 20 minutes throughout the day.

If you can, I highly recommend reserving an Executive Floor Room. This will allow access to the lounge which serves breakfast in the morning, afternoon tea and evening cocktails. They also have beverages and snacks throughout the day. The lounge is spacious and comfortable and provides stunning views of the area. The best part though is the personalized service you'll receive from the dedicated staff.

Try the Hilton Tokyo, you won't be sorry!

Also, the airport limo bus from Narita and Haneda Airports drop you off right in front of the lobby.

PS: they are now back with Crabtree & Evelyn bath products!",5,2017/06/04
1,REDACTED,en,341,"Upon late arrival into Tokyo, we were quickly attended by a very friendly front desk associate who provided Hilton Diamond recognition and we were granted access to the executive lounge and an upgraded large room. She was proactive and sincere, making this 4 nights paid stay a wonderful start.
The executive lounge was enlarged significantly as compared to the past in order to accommodate the number of guests and it provided a comfortable and wonderful ambience. The club level associates were friendly and efficient.
Location, as other reviewers have mentioned, was great and was within walking distance to the JR station to take daily trips outside Tokyo.",5,2017/06/04
1,REDACTED,en,342,"Fantastic Hotel stay at Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku. Excellent location and excellent service! There are no cons to this hotel. Staff was helpful in every department. From concierge, to bell service, to front desk, to fitness facility and shuttle service - it was a delight to relax here after a full day of touring.",5,2017/06/03
1,REDACTED,en,343,"This property is conveniently located in the Nishi Shinjuku part of town. We took a taxi in, and as a Diamond member, we were upgraded to an executive twin room. The room had wonderful views of the city and was very clean. Room amenities included a mini bar, bottled water, Japanese style robes, room slippers, a safe, and toiletries. We used a Pasmo card to get around for the first few days, since Nishi Shinjuku station is services by Tokyo metro only, not JR lines. 

The staff is extremely helpful and we inquired about arranging for our luggage to be shipped to our hotel in Kyoto, our next destination. However, we ultimately did not use the service at that time. We did have the hotel hold our luggage for several hours after check out. This was an easy process and they had dedicated staff for this.",4,2017/06/03

1,REDACTED,en,345,"Very quite comfortable room at a reasonable price. Had 4 nights here and was happy with the comfort level and amenities, Excellent breakfast menu for all tastes. Whilst the room was not quite as large as some places it was more than enough for the 4 nights.
None of the hotels we used in Japan had extra large rooms. After sight seeing all day I just want to relax and sleep well. That was achieved. Excellent hotel all round. The Hotel is located close to railway station and we had no trouble getting to all our departures etc. If your going to Tokyo than the robot restaurant and show is a must.",5,2017/06/02

Rooms are clean and reasonable sized. Shuttle bus to Shinjuku station is conveniently available at the lobby, frequent and timely.",5,2017/06/01
1,REDACTED,en,348,Well placed hotel. Easy access to subway . Rooms were very nice with an awesome shower. Shuttle access to shinjuku station was a huge plus. I was a diamond member and they didn't seem welcoming for my loyalty. Tried to charge me for extra for connecting rooms when they had never mentioned it previously. The breakfast us so so with not much variety. And it was the same all 3 days we stayed.,3,2017/05/30
1,REDACTED,en,349,"Being a frequent visitor to Tokyo, this is the first time I've stayed at the Hilton in Shinjuku. I stayed here over 4 nights while on a business trip in May'17.

The reception received and the check in was typical of a Hilton - quick and fuss free, even though I arrived close to midnight.

I had chosen my room from the Hilton app (a very nice feature!) so I went directly up after check in.

The room was nice and spacious, but some of the local Japanese hotels I've stayed in had newer designs and layouts, especially the showers.

The only thing keeping the rest of the bathroom dry was an old fashioned glass divider that was less than 1/3 the length of the tub - needless to say, it didn't do a good job of keeping the place very dry, especially since the hotel had excellent water pressure! :D

The airconditioning rattled somewhat at certain settings. but being a heavy sleeper, it didn't matter all that much. The gym was quite basic, though it did have a basic selection of dumbells and some weights machines.

Location was good, with an underground walkway from the hotel to the Nishi-Shinjuku station (1 stop from Shinjuku).

Overall, a nice hotel - but some of the local Japanese hotels are more modern in design, albeit a little less spacious.",3,2017/05/30

1,REDACTED,en,352,This is one of my fave Hilton properties worldwide. The location is great...its situated right above a metro station and the hotel also offers a complimentary shuttle service between the hotel and Shinjuku main station about every 20min. There is also a limo airport bus that stops directly at the hotel from Haneda airport. The bus takes only 45 min when there is no traffic and costs around only 2000 yen. The rooms are clean and have a bit of a Japanese twist. Hilton Gold Members also have the opportunity to choose a free Japanese style breakfast at the Japanese restaurant. The concierge is also super helpful and will prebook all your bus tickets and how confirm your onwards journey. Would stay again. Fabulous experience .,5,2017/05/29

1,REDACTED,en,354,"We stayed in the Hilton for four nights at the end of our 20 day Japan holiday and can only recommend this wonderful hotel. 

The location is central but quiet, the shuttle bus to and from Shinjuku station speedy and efficient, the building and the rooms in fantastic condition and the staff goes out of their way to make your stay memorable. Their slogan is ""We will make it right"" and we had the opportunity to test this promise after the guests staying in the room above us were partying too loud for two nights. After our complaint, Ernesto from guest relations took on the issue and solved it in a more than satisfactory way. Thanks again, Ernesto, for this great service. 

We can therefore highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017/05/27
1,REDACTED,en,355,"The hotel is located about 15 minutes walk from Shinjuku station (West Exit). if you use the shuttle bus service which runs every 20 minutes both ways, it will be a 10 minutes trip. Our room was sufficiently large and had a comfortable queen bed. If you appreciate a quiet stay, this Hilton provides it. Two small complaints concern the lobby and the shower. Despite its size, the 1st floor lobby offers a small sitting area. Because there is a large eating area occupying half of the floor, I only saw 2 arm chairs and 2 back to back couches (allowing maybe 10 to 12 people to sit). As to the shower in our room, the glass panel on the tub was too short in my opinion. I prefer a wall to wall panel so that you can take a shower without worrying about spilling and splashing water to the bathroom floor. The hotel has few restaurants (look great but on expensive side). However, it appears that every high rise building nearby has a restaurant floor or two, usually in the basement area. You can have great choices. Overall it is a great hotel at great location. Kabuki-cho, one of Asia's top night spot, can be reached by the shuttle and a 7 minutes walk. Taxi will cost you around 650 to 700 Yen.",4,2017/05/26
1,REDACTED,en,356,"My husband and I booked a last minute trip to Tokyo in late April and got our hotel rooms only 3 days before our trip. Most hotels were fully booked and overpriced for a small room, hence we decided to spend just a little bit more and got the Suite in Hilton Tokyo.

Location: Strategically located in Shinjuku, it is a great tourist spot which is convenient but not in the midst of the hustle and bustle. If you like a more serene area that's 5-10 mins walks away from the heart of the shopping area, then this is perfect. Cabs were aplenty and there is also an Airport Limousine service that stops right at the entrance of the hotel.

Hotel grounds: The facade of Hilton was typical - old and slightly outdated. The entrance/reception area are spacious but also the old world glamorous. Not updated and modern. Being a popular chain, it was definitely crowded.

Room: We booked the Executive King Junior Suite which was 44sqm and it was luxurious and very spacious which is so precious in a crowded city. There were plenty of space to put our luggage and walk around. The king bed was comfy and there was a large living area with a huge sofa and coffee table. There was also a counter area with Japanese teapot set and Nespresso machine with complimentary tea, coffee and bottled water. The bathroom was a little small for a large room and the shower area is a little tiny which shares a relatively small bathtub. However I liked the strong water pressure and the Thomas Roth toiletries provided.

Lounge: Staying in a suite means we get free access to the club lounge. As a typical international hotel chain, the lounge was big and had lots of variety of food and beverages, including all kinds of alcohol. The only downside was that it was VERY CROWDED. It's almost packed every evening when we were there (around 5/6pm) and this means that it can be a little rowdy. 

Dining: Other than the typical complimentary buffet or lounge breakfast, Hilton has a special Japanese breakfast (Kaiseki style) and requires reservation in advance and there are also seating timings too. This was unique hence we made an effort to try it at least once. The food was traditional and pretty good (which you can see from my photos) but I could tell that some of the guests were not used to the flavours. My husband and I, however enjoyed the experience.

Service at the reception, lounge and all around were excellent hence we will definitely consider staying at Hilton again.",5,2017/05/26
1,REDACTED,en,357,Clean and roomy room for what you pay. Room is well maintained and gives you a good sleep time after a long walk around Shinjuku area. Walking distance to amnesties. Good values for money. I'd only complain the breakfast time a bit crowded around 7:30 that waiters can't accomodate my needs fast enough. Overall is a good hotel to stay in Shinjuku.,4,2017/05/25

1,REDACTED,en,361,Great services and facilities as expected from the Hilton brand. Top level attention received from all staff. Convenient access from Narita and Haneda airports through Airport Limousine Bus negates the need to transfer to local train/subways,5,2017/05/23
1,REDACTED,en,362,"Just finishing a 3-day stay on the executive floor. Here on vacation with wife and older daughter. Had a 1 bedroom suite (sounds spacial, and by Tokyo standards probably is but overall I thought the space was small, especially the bathroom). However, overall, I would say this property excels on service, the overall customer experience, the breakfast offering (both on the executive floor but especially on the main floor), and general proximity to all things in Tokyo.

Specifics:

- Shinjuku is as reasonable as any location in Tokyo. I know it's known for being a business center but access to the subway is excellent, there are lots of restaurants in the area, and the Shinjuku night district is within easy walking access. Shinjuku train station is a short walk away (or, take the Hilton shuttle bus every 20 or so minutes). You could go to Roppongi, or to central Tokyo, fine, no problem, but I found Shinjuku to be quite high quality.

- Asian Hiltons are not the same as Hilton properties located in the U.S. (thankfully).

- The Hilton Tokyo has an EXCEPTIONAL level of customer service.

- Rooms: We had 2, a 1 bedroom suite and a regular room. Bathrooms are tiny in both. But other than that the rooms are generally fine. I would have preferred a bit better lighting in the suite. Beds were excellent. Showers more than adequate. A/C was fine. Internet very good.

- Breakfast is awesome. Definitely get that in your room rate. Truly, this is the best breakfast buffet service we've ever encountered. Massive fruit offerings; smoked salmon; superb Asian fare; and the list goes on. I couldn't imagine how to improve on the offering.

- Very convenient shuttle service to/from Shinjuku Station. Also direct bus service to/from Narita airport (although I recommend taking the Narita Express train to Shinjuku - it's faster, but not necessarily more convenient given that you have to navigate the expanse of Shinjuku Station.)

- Restaurants on site are exceptional. The Metropolitan is special, but it comes at a price, however it is worth it. There are several other food options, and although I didn't have a chance to try them all, I would not hesitate to do so.

- The 2 bars are exceptional, if not expensive (but, this is Tokyo), they are definitely exceptional quality and above average service.

- Concierge service: Excellent.

- Executive floor: Definitely worth it. The evening program of cocktails (free) and appetizers is an exceptional value.

Bottom line: Price/value: Exceptional. 

Yes, this is a large hotel, generally business oriented, but not overly so. Japanese quality in terms of service and customer orientation. 

Footnote: There are two subway station entrances within a 3 minute walk from the hotel.

Final comment: you will not go wrong on the price-value equation here. The Asian Hilton management (and I've stayed at several of their properties, several of which are 'franchised') across Asia, are excellent. Again, exceptional price-value.",5,2017/05/23
1,REDACTED,en,363,"Great location in Shinjuku, even if you have to take a shuttle bus. They are pretty frequent so it's no big deal. I feel like hotels in Tokyo are so hard to book, so very grateful this hotel had available rooms. It was worth it.",4,2017/05/22
1,REDACTED,en,364,"The only bad thing I can say is that I have a polyester allergy, so I had to use the cotton bedsheets I bring on most trips every night (all our other hotels in Japan had 100% cotton sheets). Other than that, this hotel was fantastic. The location is conveniently right above access to the train station, the check in and check out procedure was smooth, English speaking staff were more common than in many other hotels and the quality of food and the rooms were likewise excellent. If you didn't feel like dining through room service or any of the wonderful restaurants, there was a convenience store in the basement that sold snacks, instant foods etc. Like most hotels in Japan the toilet was equipped with a Toto electronic bidet seat (you will want one as soon as you get home!). Aside from my own personal allergy issue, I could not find any fault with this property. Highly recommend.",5,2017/05/21

Why I would watch out for is the pricing of the restaurants. The Japanese on the 2 floor especially. I had dinner alone and was surprised that I spent 22000 yen , crazy really for what it was.

Room was not huge, but clean and nicely arranged. Location was a little far from central Shinjuku, but there's a nice little park with Sakura trees nearby. Would come back if we wanted to stay in Shinjuku again!",5,2017/05/14

Great shower/soaking tub combo in bathroom, so nice for relaxing in after a long day of sightseeing. Excellent buffet breakfast with good selection of Western and Asian choices, as well as freshly made smoothies. Very helpful and courteous staff. 10 minute walk to Shinjuku station. Will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Tokyo.",5,2017/05/13

1,REDACTED,en,381,"My husband and I spent a week touring Tokyo, and this hotel was our home base. Overall, the hotel met or exceeded our expectations. For a major city, the hotel has large rooms with spacious bathrooms. The hotel was exceptionally clean. The bed was OK. The nicest aspect of our stay at this hotel was the fact that breakfast was included. The breakfast was fabulous. They had everything one could want. The staff at the hotel was attentive and met our needs. Another great aspect of this hotel was that it is located on top of a subway station. We used the subway to navigate Tokyo all week, and it was super easy.",4,2017/05/12

Good breakfast buffet with variety of choices.

Location is a bit far away from all the actions in Shinjuku but you can walk through underground walkway and it takes about 10 min. and the hotel have a shuttle to take you there during the day which is convenience.",4,2017/05/10

Another 7 0 kilometers of drive and we were tired when we checked into the Hilton hotel..we were revived to see the large spacious rooms, very tastefully decorated with all imaginable facilities ; the grandeur befitting the Hilton brand ..The balcony afforded an enchanting view of the Tokyo city, the bridges ,the zooming trans, and the bewitching lights in the night. Services both at the front desk and the restaurant were excellent. The breakfast spread was sumptuous , catering to the taste of the various groups of tourists staying in the hotel.",5,2017/05/10
1,REDACTED,en,388,"Spent 4 nights at this hotel. Its a big business hotel that was a good base to explore Tokyo.

I booked a junior suite. No Diamond upgrade but the room was very nice. It was large and well laid out with a L-shaped couch, desk and king bed. The bathroom was oddly shaped/designed, with the toilet and sink sandwiched into a small area and a tub in the shower. But the water pressure was great, had a fancy Japanese toilet and lots of toiletries. 

On-Property dining options were fine. We received breakfast buffet in the lobby restaurant. There were plenty of choices, including Asian and Western cuisine. Food was a bit institutional but tasty. The Executive lounge was nice but got really crowded in the evening. It was best early in the morning for coffee and sunrise views. The hotel bar was good for a night cap. Note that smoking is permitted in the bar.

Location is ideal. You're just a 5-10 minute walk from heart of Shinjuku or you can take the hotel shuttle to the station. There's also a subway station just behind the hotel. We used both the Airport Limo Bus and Narita Express to get to/from the hotel. No problems with either. We took the airport bus to the hotel, which is probably best to avoid navigating Shinjuku station with bags after a long flight. The bus was much faster than advertised and dropped us right at the hotel doorstep. Airport bus tickets were sold out on day of return so we just used the Narita Express, which was fast, clean and comfortable. 

Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Hilton Tokyo. It's a big metropolitan business hotel, which makes it a bit impersonal and chaotic. But as a base to explore this great city, we had no issues and would return.",4,2017/05/09
1,REDACTED,en,389,The best hotel stay . Room is great . The service is second to none. The food in the hotel restaurants are fantastic. Still trying to get my head around how big Tokyo is. Mt Fuji tomorrow could have done with a few more days in Tokyo. Will recommend the Tokyo Hilton for a fantastic place to stay.,5,2017/05/08
1,REDACTED,en,390,"Had a lovely stay at the Tokyo Hilton. I would highly recommend the executive lounge for special treatment and a little bit more luxe. The rooms were smallish but adequate and the breakfast had everything you could imagine. Great water pressure in the shower and lovely crisp linens. The executive lounge also had a DVD catalogue that could be borrowed to watch in the room. My only recommendation, is the same for all executive lounges - the Hilton should consider having a family lounge for those with children as I don't believe they should be in the executive lounge. Something the Hilton should consider worldwide....or at least have part of the executive lounge which is child-free. It is hard to do work with kids about.",5,2017/05/07
1,REDACTED,en,391,"I took my family of four (wife and 2 sons ages 11 & 7) to Japan for Spring Break 2017. As you know, most Japanese hotels are small and usually will only accommodate 3 people in a room. So, our choices were already limited. We are Hilton Honors members and decided to the Hilton Tokyo a try, especially because there was a good deal on suites if I prepaid. So, that's what I did. However, to be frank, as we neared our trip, I was starting to worry about having selected the Hilton, since some friends recommended a few hotels that were more trendy and centrally located. In my mind, I started to compare it to some Hiltons I've stayed at in the U.S. which were not very nice. 

Luckily, I had already pre-paid and couldn't cancel. Hilton prepay had saved me from myself!!! The minute we walked in, we were all impressed. The assistance and guidance with our luggage and front desk service made us feel like royalty. 

Accommodations: We had a king suite on the 23rd floor and saying we were wowed is a huge understatement. I felt like I walked into a celebrity mansion on that old MTV show CRIBS. (see our photos attached). Since there were four of us, they had already set up an additional rollaway bed. The shower and bath combo was strange at first, but it all made sense later and we ended up loving it. One of my key evaluations of hotels worldwide is the water pressure and this hotel did not disappoint. The range of water pressure went from gentle spring to all out firehose!!! Wow!!! Let's not even mention the TOTO heated seat toilets and washlets. AMAAAAAZING!!! Everyone in America and the world needs to get a TOTO toilet. There would be world peace just from that alone.

Executive lounge: OMG!!! The food and service there were beyond proper adjectives. There's a good mix between Western and Japanese breakfast. Fresh squeezed orange juice on demand. The omelettes were made with so much love, it was a show in itself just watching the Chef create it. Hard to explain, you just have to witness it yourself. (Caution: The eggs there might be too runny for more westerners, but not for us! Perfecto!) Our entire Japan trip could have been spent in our room, the lobby, the shops below the hotel (Hiltopia), and the EXECUTIVE LOUNGE and we would have been quite content.

The RESTAURANTS in the hotel itself looked amazing. The pictures of the food shown in the elevator tempted us each time. However, because we had committed to actually leaving the property to see Tokyo, we opted not to eat at the hotel restaurants. 

CONVENIENCE: The hotel is conveniently situated between the Nishi (a.ka. West) Shinjuku & Tochomae Stations. Both stations can be accessed from a walkway below the hotel. From Nishi Shinjuku, you can easily hop on the Marunouchi line which connects you to the main Shinjuku Station. From the Tochomae Station you can catch the Oedo line to Ginza district. 

There's also a free Hilton Shuttle that takes you to and from Shinjuku Station. We never used it because it was so convenient to walk there.

Cuurency exchange TIP: Getting YEN is more economical (given the competitive exchange rates) via ATM machines at convenience stores like 7-11. The 7-11 brand has their own banks call 7-Banks. Luckily for you, there is a 7-Bank stand alone ATM right below the hotel across from the convenience store. 

Hotel Pool: Was not open when we were here, but who comes all the way to Tokyo to sit in a pool??

Getting to the hotel: You can easily get to the hotel from Narita Airport in comfort aboard the airport limousine. The bus driver and the hotel bellhops will handle your bags. Sit back and relax.

Hotel location: The hotel is situated on the western side of Shinjuku. The western side is quieter and away from the madness of Shinjuku's eastern side. Great for a little respite from the crowds.

Summary: During our 8 nights in Japan, we actually stayed at this hotel twice - the first 4 nights, then 2 nights at Hilton Osaka, then right back to Hilton Tokyo! Hilton Osaka was very very nice, but we all missed the executive lounge at Hilton Tokyo! We've been back two weeks already and my sons keep asking if I could make breakfast like the executive lounge? NO, I can't!!! I know everyone has different budgets, but I'm sure every room at this hotel is spectacular. Try to get access to the Executive Lounge. Even though it may appear to cost more, you save money by eating their complimentary and hearty breakfast/brunch. You can save money other ways with good cheap eats all around Tokyo too. 

I highly recommend this hotel to everyone!!! We will stay here again on our next trip to Tokyo!!!",5,2017/05/07
1,REDACTED,en,392,"My wife and I were lucky enough to combine a business trip with some pleasure time. This was the place to stay in the business district. The rooms were big. The bathroom was full size with a large shower and their was a desk area that both of us could sit at with our computers.

The breakfast buffet was to die for. It was tough not to over eat. The service desk and concierge were very attentive and spoke good English. Since this was both a business and pleasure trip, the front desk was very willing to split up the bill so I could put charges on two separate cards.

We never braved the subway but it was connected through the basement. There were also good restaurants and shops under the hotel.",5,2017/05/06

If it's of any concern to tourists, this building is earthquake safe and prepared with intercoms in every room. It's not a feature most people from the US would see or notice, but it actually makes sense. I would book another stay here at the Hilton again. It was close enough to the Shinjuku station and in a quiet neighborhood for those who would like to get away from the city bustle.",5,2017/05/03

Everything about our stay at this hotel was an example of excellence from beginning to end. The Executive lounge breakfast on the 37th floor each morning is great value (free). 
The room was clean and up-to-date, and the hotel amenities were also well maintained. 
The hotel location is central and very convenient with direct underground walking access to two nearby Metro stations. There is even a 24 hour supermarket only one block away. 
The staff are so polite and helpful - making the whole experience so warming and enjoyable. I'd highly recommend this hotel for any first time travelers to Tokyo like ourselves.

1,REDACTED,en,402,"I may be spoiled in Tokyo, as the bar for me is the Park Hyatt, so I couldn't help but compare everything to it. I spent 800 for a single night, granted it was cherry blossom season and the Park Hyatt was more than twice the cost, but it was not worth the price. (I did however pay the same rate at Park Hyatt in November 2015.) At 3 or 400, I would give it a higher rating, but I was disappointed, it just felt too clinical and lacking in any discernable personality. Again, I can't help compare it to the Park Hyatt. This is of no fault of the staff, they were very kind and helpful, but I probably wouldn't stay here again for the price.",3,2017/04/30

Our room wasn't ready when we arrived there early in the morning, but the staff on the executive lounge floor was very accommodating and stored our luggage for us. Once our room was ready, everything was placed in our room.

The room is very comfortable, with a nice bed and sofa chair by the window. The decor is very clean and chic.

The executive floor gets very crowded for happy hour, so get there early to reserve a spot. Breakfast is also very good but it doesn't get as crowded.

There is a complimentary shuttle to the subway station, but sometimes it's just a quick to walk there instead.",5,2017/04/30

I know it's a business hotel and it's a Hilton, so you expect a high level of service, but still...

Check in and check out were fast and efficient. Rooms are big, spacious and clean. Beds are comfortable and you can get a good night sleep. Rooms views are amazing. Breakfast is good with a nice choice of items. 
I really like the fact that the metro station is just beneath the hotel, so to get to all the mayor attractions on the other side of the city is fast and easy. 

There is also a free shuttle bus to Shinjuku station. Should you need to take a shuttle bus back to the airport and don't have cash, just add it to you room charge.

I am so glad we added the Executive Lounge as the breakfast was high quality food (fresh squeezed orange juice) and fresh fruit as well as all the other breakfast foods. Took advantage of afternoon tea sometimes and the Happy hour as well. The rooms large for Japan as had a King room. The only complaint is that the mattress a little hard but some like it that way.

1,REDACTED,en,410,"We visited Tokyo for a week and the Hilton Tokyo was our home base. Location is great as it is a short walk to 2 subway stations. Our room was a tad dated with stains on the wall and wallpaper starting to curl off in some areas. We had an Executive Suite. Do not assume that this means you are on the Executive Level. Our suite was on the 15th story of a 37/38 story building. The views from the Executive Lounge were great. The view from our room, not as great. The Executive Lounge was a huge perk. Additionally, being a Diamond member at this Hilton had its advantages (where some Hiltons don’t even acknowledge that). Our room was not able to be upgraded so they sent up a ½ bottle of wine to our room. Our breakfast options were the Executive Lounge or the restaurant in the lobby. We ate at the restaurant each morning. 
This hotel is one of the busiest Hiltons I’ve stayed it. However, it did not impact the level of customer service. Everyone we ran into were very attentive and wanted to make sure their guests were happy. 
Would I stay again? When we went their room prices were quite high. I’m not sure it’s worth the cost, in all honesty. The hotel is a bit dated. I have no problem spending a lot on hotels. But I do if the room itself shows a lot of wear and tear, as ours did. I think our next Trip to Tokyo I would try another Hilton property, maybe the Conrad. Nothing against this hotel, just that the prices are high for what you get.",4,2017/04/27

1,REDACTED,en,412,"For the exacting and impeccable Japanese standards this was well worth the rate. 

First class hotel throughout , brilliant location for a family holiday. Walkable to Shinjuku rail station (pleasant 15 mins) or Hilton runs a continuous mini bus every 20 mins.

Had booked a king Junior suite with extra bed for our teenager but a lovely surprise to be upgraded to a king city suite (50sqm with 2 large separate rooms). Enjoyed the one afternoon we made it back to the Executive lounge for evening cocktails. Guests queue up to get its so delicious!

Having stayed in many Tokyo hotels was expecting a minuscule bathroom, but this was a fab room with warmed toilet seat (luxury!) and large shower (one glass wall to bedroom). 

Cannot rate this hotel more highly. From the generous buffet breakfast to library with Macs & free wifi, underground tunnel to neighbouring office buildings. Superb location if you're intending to sightsee and take Tokyo metro. 

Must try is the Japanese onsen in Health club changing rooms. The leisure facilities were unexpectedly good, an indoor pool and 2 gyms. 

Side note: we were shaken awake by a 6.9 Richter earthquake early one morning. The hotel's siren and bilingual guest announcements immediately kicked in. On the 17th floor we felt the building sway for a minute with loud pops and creaking for another 5. We were impressed by the emergency handling and felt safe and in touch with updates.

1,REDACTED,en,416,"We spent three nights at the Tokyo Hotel in Shinjuku, Tokyo in mid-April, and it was everything I expected it to be. Shinjuku is a great neighborhood with lots of shops and restaurants. We had a family of 5, with one triple room with three twin beds, and one double room with two twin beds. The rooms were pretty standard, with a little Japanese flair, with nice views, comfortable beds, and nice amenities. 

The hotel is a big, bustling, Western-style luxury hotel, at the high end of the various Hilton properties around the world. I often stay in a Hilton Hotel in NYC, and I noticed right away that the lobby smelled very similar to the NYC hotel. We saw where they piped in the scent. I wonder if it is the Hilton signature scent? It was funny, but it did make me feel at home. 

We had some confusion with our check in, because we had reserved the two rooms separately, one with Hilton points and one with Amex points, so it was difficult linking the two reservations. I had anticipated that, and tried calling in advance to explain, but we had to work it out when we arrived in person. This led to some difficulty in getting a package delivered later, but that sort of thing is to be expected in a big hotel. The staff were very attentive and eager to help, and everyone spoke excellent, perfectly fluent English, as I would have expected in a Hilton hotel. The concierge staff were helpful in giving us directions and making suggestions. 

The hotel has a big breakfast buffet in the lobby, which had many Western and Japanese selections. Our kids really loved it. There were several restaurants on site, which we did not get to sample, although two kids downed by jet lag did get room service dinner one night, and it met with their approval. We did peek in on one of the restaurants, I think it was a Chinese restaurant, and it looked very nice. 

The hotel runs a frequent shuttle bus to and from Shinjuku Station, which is very convenient. It is a good way to get around. We had planned to take the Romancecar Train from Shinjuku Station to Hakone, which is one reason we chose this hotel. Unfortunately, the day we were scheduled to take the train, there was an accident, and the train was cancelled, but we got there on a regular commuter train. Best laid plans and all. 

The hotel also sits above an underground shopping arcade, and the Nishi-Shinjuku subway station, which is also quite convenient. There was a coffee shop there, where we got coffee one morning, and a convenience store as well (maybe a Family Mart?) The subway station is not directly below the hotel. It is at least a 10 minute or so walk underground, but it worked out well for traveling by subway around Tokyo, which is very large. 

Shinjuku Chuo Park is a short walk from the hotel. It has a shrine, a waterfall, playgrounds, sculptures, etc. My husband enjoyed running there in the morning, and we enjoyed walking there as a family. The hotel is convenient to many other interesting sites. 

Overall, we had a great experience at this hotel and would stay again. I highly recommend it.",4,2017/04/25

1,REDACTED,en,421,"My friend and I just came back from our 6 day trip to Tokyo. Thoroughly enjoyed the trip and one of the reasons is because of the good nights sleep at the Hilton. 
We stayed in a deluxe twin room on the 25th floor. The rooms were spacious by Japan standards. It was clean and comfortable to stay in. 
This hotel is closer to Haneda airport. We booked the airport limousine bus from the airport to the hotel. It does take a while as it stops at the domestic terminals, Shinjuku station before it en routes to the Hilton. 
We took the free shuttle from Hilton each day, that takes you to the Shinjuku station ( and back). It runs in 20 minute intervals. The drivers are friendly and always on time. 
If you choose to walk, it is a nice 13 minute walk from the hotel to the station.

Room is not too big but very clean and enough amenities and a mini-fridge, flawless internet service. We had access to the Diamond lounge which has a self-serve bar and a variety of snacks. hotel is very well located and there is regular shuttle service to the metro station. There is also a convenience store in the basement level of the hotel.",5,2017/04/22
1,REDACTED,en,424,"Started our trip in Tokyo and stayed at this Hilton property in Shinjuku. Easy access to subway, taxis are easily available at the lobby and the staff are non other than superb and wonderful with customer service. They really want to make sure you are taken care of from the moment you check in to the time you check out. Our stay was wonderful. We enjoyed the buffet breakfast. It was beautifully set up and servers were so nice. The food was great. American breakfast was available as well as Asian breakfast and food. It was pretty diverse with food options.
We especially loved the afternoon tea service but you need to have reservations for that. The earlier the better. 
Our stay was even more special with the help of Ms. Keiko Kumagai | Assis. Front Office Mngr. she was super at helping us during our stay with recommendations to eateries and getting around. She went above and beyond with taking good care of us as guests of the Hilton property. We found Japan at an early start of our stay to have the most polite, genuinely nice and really sweet people as well as the cleanest countries we have ever visited. It is so refreshing and inspiring. The hotel property has a great chocolatier at the lobby. A little chocolate won't hurt your waistline. Another wonderful hotel stay with the Hilton. Can't go wrong. To the next lodging fellow travelers.",5,2017/04/22

1,REDACTED,en,426,Hilton Tokyo has earned the title of my favourite hotel in the world. Not only is the hotel and restaurant(s) stunning but the service is outstanding. We booked two nights to start our honeymoon in Japan. We were greeted at the hotel and told that we had a complimentary upgrade to a suite with executive lounge access. When we arrived in our room we had a gift of chop sticks (traditional Japanese wedding gift) and fresh fruit. The room was stunning and the food amazing. We cannot thank the staff of Hilton Tokyo enough for giving us such a magical start to our honeymoon.,5,2017/04/21
1,REDACTED,en,427,"Brilliant stay- location, service and facilities. Just a 5 minute walk to Shinjuku station- possibly the busiest one in Tokyo. Multiple options to travel to Tokyo station. Polite and helpful staff, felt very welcome. Compared to the arrogant Hilton staff in USA and the indifferent ones in UK, this was a very welcome change. Planning to go back to Tokyo in the near future and would definitely stay here.",5,2017/04/21
1,REDACTED,en,428,Everyone was pleasant the minute we walked in. The staffs speak English. The place is very clean. Our room was nice and large. The exec lounge was great and provide the expected great items as well as comp drinks. Great comp breakfast for the honor members!,5,2017/04/21
1,REDACTED,en,429,"There is a subway station right beside the hotel accessible via an walking underpass. When I first arrived I couldn't believe how busy and noisy both the lobby and restaurants were. Thankfully my room was very quiet. My hotel room seemed to be recently remodeled in a modern decor. It was very clean. The glass shower makes it possible to watch TV and shower at the same time! The lighting and temperature controls were great. The WiFi worked well. The bed was comfy (if just a bit hard), but I slept very well each night.

There were always lines at the concierge, but they were able to handle my requests adequately. There is a city park nearby which is nice to walk in the morning. The Imperial gardens are just a few subway stops away - the most stunning garden I viewed on my 3 week trip.

The gym is mostly cardio equipment. There is a tiny weight room, but it didn't have small dumbbells for women. There was a small area where one or two people could do yoga, work on a ball, or stretch. The pool was closed during my stay. One of the reasons I booked this hotel was for gym access, and I'm glad there was not an extra charge. The gym equipment is brand new. There are hot tubs (onsen) in the locker rooms. There are two tennis courts.

There was a refrigerator in the room, but it was packed tight with minibar items. I went to one of the Hilton hotel restaurants my first night and I couldn't believe how high the prices were. So every night thereafter I just grabbed takeaway from ground level of department stores (pro tip - you've never seen department stores with food displays like they have in Japan) and ate in my room. There is an ATM in Hiltopia (the small collection of shops and restaurants in the basement of the Hilton) that has a 7-11 ATM (one of the few which allow you to get cash with your American bank card).

I did splurge on room service breakfast each morning, and it was first rate. Very well presented and more than adequate quantities.

If a cardio gym is important to you, then this hotel is a sure bet.",4,2017/04/20
1,REDACTED,en,430,"Stayed 5 nights. Location of Hotel in Shinjuku is ideal for exploring the highlights of Tokyo. The famous Shibuya crossing, bustling District of Harajuku, high end shopping at Ginza and the fashionable Roppongi are all well connected by metro from Shinjuku station which is only 7 minutes walk from hotel and serviced by free Hotel shuttle bus. Peaceful tranquility of Shinjuku Gyoen gardens is at 30 minutes by foot

Excellent clean, well appointed and spacious rooms rooms. Excellent restaurant services. Multiple restaurants dotted around the first floor catering to Japanese, Chinese, continental cuisines including a grill room for tasty meaty steaks. Zatta bar is lively colourful and well stocked, though tad pricey (mind you, you are in Tokyo).

1,REDACTED,en,431,"Stayed at the Hilton Tokyo for a total of 8 nights! I've stayed at many Hilton's, but this one was by far the best in customer service & guest satisfaction. Front desk staff, concierge staff, down to housekeeping, spa clerk, marble lounge waitresses & waiters... everyone was welcoming & did an amazing job! Loved our stay & would love to come back!!

Things to note: free shuttle to and from Shinjuku station that leaves 3x per hour. was convenient. 

Also, if you stay out late and can't make the last shuttle, the hotel is connected to the underground toei station.

1,REDACTED,en,432,"We stayed for just a weekend, the prices at app. 500 USD were a bit too high but nothing crazy if you check the prices of other hotels of similar level.
Service was top quality.
The room was pretty big and it had great views.
The bathroom was large enough even if it does not seem so in my picture. 
The hotel sent our luggage from Tokyo to Kyoto for a really, really low price and they shipped it wrapped in plastic so that it would arrive in perfect conditions, service was impeccable.
We did not use the restaurant but there were always lines to get in, sometime pretty long.
The shopping arcade (basement floor) has a 7eleven and a coffeshop which meant we did not need the hotel's breakfast.
It was a great stay and we would probably repeat it in the same conditions.",4,2017/04/19
1,REDACTED,en,433,"Stayed in a suite comprising of a sitting room and bedroom. However,the bathroom was small compared to the rest of room. Funnily, we had 2 sets of wardrobes and 2 luggage racks, Looks as if they used 2 'normal' hotel rooms to form a suite forgetting to extend the bathroom.
On the whole, it was a very comfortable stay.
Having the Club Room for breakfast and pre-dinner drinks was really nice.

The concierge were very knowledgable about the area.
The free shuttle to Shinjuku station was an added bonus!
Remember to borrow an umbrella if it's raining.",5,2017/04/19
1,REDACTED,en,434,"Overall, a nice stay. Staff is very, very friendly. English spoken quite well by pretty much everyone I interfaced with -- not just concierge and check-in. Clean and fairly modern lobby, and nicely-appointed rooms. Stayed 7 nights, and the cleaning was not an issue. Plenty of fresh towels and sundries each day. The breakfast buffet had a fair amount of non-Japanese options, including traditional American eggs and bacon, along with baked beans, hash browns, fruit. Fairly expensive at ~$35, but was on the company dime. Also ate at the steakhouse and had a $45 hamburger. You get the picture. The location is decent with a short walk to Shinjuku Station, and the hotel offers a shuttle to the Station, along with free bikes you can borrow if you'd prefer to ride as many in Tokyo do. Overall, a good experience, would stay again.",4,2017/04/18
1,REDACTED,en,435,My wife and I went to Osaka Japan in 2016 and stayed at the Hilton Hotel and enjoyed the accommodation there. When we planned our trip to Tokyo in January 2017 we decided to use the Hilton hotel again. This proved to be the absolute best decision made. Hilton Tokyo is situated in a lovely location closed to main train/bus stations and yet the hotel itself is away from the hustle bustle. Our room was spacious and clean with a nice view of the nearby park/gardens. Breakfast was wonderful and lots of different varieties. All staff are friendly and helpful. We would grade the Hilton one of the nicest hotel we've stayed and would recommend it to anyone!,5,2017/04/18
1,REDACTED,en,436,"This hotel was our first pit stop in a 14 day visit to Japan. The hotel is located in a quiet neighbourhood. Cheek by jowl with the Park Hyatt and the Keio Plaza, the hotel manages to hold its own. The hotel is serviced by the Airport Limousine from Narita Airport, hence travel from the airport to the hotel is quite easy.

There was an influx of guests when we arrived, but the entire check in process was efficient and friendly. Our room was on the 27th floor. Being given to understand that real estate was at a premium in Japan, we were pleasantly surprised by the size of the rooms. Our room was extremely spacious, with enough room to stow our luggage. We were tired after a long flight, but room service promptly came to our rescue. 

The hotel has a shuttle to Shinjuku station once in 20 minutes, which makes it easy to go to where the action is. A leisurely walk to the station would take about 15 minutes.

The staff were extremely friendly and service with a smile seemed to be their motto.
Breakfast was not included in our package. However, a buffet breakfast is available in the mornings. Vegetarian options were limited. Bakery products were fresh and there were plenty of fruits. 

Since the hotel straddled a subway station and also since there was a shuttle to Shinjuku, travel was never a problem. Taxis were plentiful. Tokyo station was about a half hour away by taxi.

The lobby did seem crowded at times, but I guess that was because there was a beauty pageant of some sort that was going on.
If you’re looking for a quiet, secure neighbourhood, this would be a hotel I would recommend .",4,2017/04/18
1,REDACTED,en,437,Stayed in this hotel with my family for 4 nights. Expensive but it was an excellent choice. The location is very convenient. Quality of rooms and the level of service was great. The free shuttle bus service every 15 minutes was excellent. Plenty of good Restaurants & shopping near by. Shinjuku station is a 10 minute walk. Stayed one more night on my way back from Kyoto. Would definitely choose this hotel again and recommend to any one looking for quality and service.,5,2017/04/18
1,REDACTED,en,438,"After staying at the Hilton for a week. On my honeymoon I might add. I love Hiltons usually. I'm super disappointed. Here is the good. (I'm not one to write a bad review.) 

It's a beautiful hotel in a good location. If you like to feel completely anonymous you will. Nice big rooms for Tokyo. But you are made to feel like nothing special here. 

The Bad 
1. I was chased out of the executive lounge, embarrassed in front of other guests, as I was asked to give back two waters that my husband and I had opened. She took them from my hands and trashed them. Felt really un-neccessary. 

2. Numerous times in the morning we would order coffee. It was either forgotten or we were brought the wrong drink.

3. When asking concierge if I could get an english menu for room service, I was made to feel really dumb for not realising it wasn't in the book but on the TV.

These are small things. But I'm a sucker for good service. The little ways a staff makes you feel means a lot. If thats something you enjoy when spending a lot of money on a hotel... I don't recommend staying here.",1,2017/04/18
1,REDACTED,en,439,"As an HHonors member I've stayed at several Hiltons and have come to expect a solid 4/5 standard and have rarely been disappointed. What pushed this experience up to 5/5 was this: I arrived early and reception said that although the hotel was fully booked they would be able to let me check in early if I didn't mind having a room with a connecting door to the next room (locked, of course). I don't mind a connecting door, and I've stayed in such rooms many times, but I have never EVER before been asked by reception whether it would be OK! I appreciated the extra courtesy and will definitely consider the Hilton Tokyo if I ever have a chance to return to Tokyo with some more time -- this was a brief three-day business trip.",5,2017/04/17
1,REDACTED,en,440,Overall excellent hospitality. Very convenient. Meals at the Marble Lounge restaurant were excellent quality. Buffet options provided a range of variety. We used the bus transfer to/ from the Narita Airport. It was convenient and cost effective.,5,2017/04/17
1,REDACTED,en,441,"You will pay quite a bit to stay here (the only reason I can't give five stars - it is quite expensive for such small rooms), but you at least know what you're getting: (1) a Hilton (2) in Shinjuku. It's a great hotel in a great part of town, centrally located for a Tokyo - based vacation.

The room was spotless and well tended to every day.

The location cannot be beaten. We stayed in Tokyo for a week and used this as a hub for Disney, Yokohama, and everything in between.

A lot of foreigners stay at this hotel - more than I have ever seen together in any one place in Japan. That is neither a bad not good thing, but if your Japanese is rusty or non-existent, you can stay here with minimal difficulty.

Word to the wise: this hotel is about 1 kilometer from Shinjuku station. That is not a huge distance, but it can be if you are hauling around a ton of luggage from the train station. If I had to do it over again, once I got off the train at Shinjuku, I would transfer over to the Toei Oedo line and travel one stop over to Tochomae, which is adjacent to the hotel.

Breakfast buffet is strictly okay. My kid loved it, but I honestly prefer any one of the many adjacent coffee shops.",4,2017/04/17

1,REDACTED,en,443,"The staff were incredibly rude and unhelpful. 
Felt like we weren't taken seriously because we weren't arriving in uniforms/ suits & dresses.
Unable to get food unless you've reserved a table way in advance.
Room shutters rattled intermittently which prevented sleep.


Problems we encountered:

- Tried to change rooms or pay for upgrade as we weren't able to sleep, was fobbed off and made a joke of by members of staff.
- Asked to cancel breakfast, was advised it was a package deal and rudely dismissed.
- Room shutters made walls shake and items on desk move, we couldn't sleep.
- Arrived after nearly a 6 hour journey without food, we were told the restaurants were fully reserved. When asked if they could point us to somewhere close by to eat, they made a point to call and suddenly two seats were available.
- Upon arrival and departure, we saw the staff watching us with our suitcases move, while they rushed to help business men with their single suitcase.

We were treated with disrespect and rudeness. We were laughed at directly by the staff and presented with earplugs when we mentioned the noise, as our only solution. 
Considering the reputation of this chain elsewhere, this experience was not up to the normal Hilton standards by any means. I would not recommend this hotel.",2,2017/04/17

1,REDACTED,en,447,"As a diamond member of Hilton HHonors I was rather surprised not to receive the welcome letter,amenity and room upgrade that I have always received in the past when checking in to Hiltons in Asian cities. I was even more surprised to be told that I could not use the regular executive lounge in the evenings but rather a smaller one for loyalty guests. But it was uphill from there. Our room was fine (other than what seems increasingly inevitable - screaming kid next door), and the executive lounge was terrific, and everywhere was smoke-free. The staff were super: respectful, friendly, and helpful. (Special thanks to Toshie Nakashima for her helpful sightseeing suggestions and beautiful origami gift.) The location is perfect for exploring Tokyo, and the addition of the free shuttle to Shinjuku station was a real bonus.

1,REDACTED,en,450,"My recent stay at the Tokyo Hilton was made special by the wonderful staff along with a great facility and especially comfortable well appointed room. 

From the reception at the front desk all the way through to the thanks that I received upon my departure, the hotel staff was exceptionally caring.

The facilities are excellent. My room was nicely appointed, very comfortable, clean and quiet. 

As a Diamond Member I had access to the Executive Suite. In fact, my room was on the executive floor which made that especially convenient. Having arrived early evening the first night, I made a “dinner” of the hors d'oeuvres and open bar. One other evening I stopped by for a drink but otherwise I was busy with business meetings each evening – still I was pleased with the food and service. The Executive Suite was busy but the hosts controlled things with assigned seating.

I did have breakfast one morning in the Executive Suite and was very happy with the choices including cooked to order eggs/omelets. But all of the other mornings I chose to eat downstairs at the Marble Lounge that has a fantastic breakfast buffet – this was complimentary as a Hilton Diamond member. Having an early breakfast helped avoid what appeared to be fairly large crowds later in the morning.

One evening a colleague and I got back to the hotel after the Executive Lounge had closed and we met for a nightcap at the Zatta Lounge. The setting was great and there was a small jazz combo playing which set a comfortable mood.

The hotel is within easy walking distance of the Nishi-Shinjuku subway station and there is an underground connection to the main Shinjuku Station – just take the escalator from the lobby down and it’s an easy 15 min walk – all underground in easy to navigate pedestrian walkways.

Getting to the hotel from Narita is cheapest by taking the Airport Limousine service directly to the hotel. Be sure to book your return bus trip ahead of time.

I recommend the Hilton Tokyo hotel.",5,2017/04/16
1,REDACTED,en,451,"We stayed here for our anniversary. I would like to say a big Thank you to Hiro and Keiko both part of the hotel leadership team. The hotel is centrally located with underground subway access to nishi shinjuku. 

If you are staying here you can also check out the Government building across the road for a great view of Tokyo and on a clear day Mount Fuji.

We stayed in a Junior King Suite. All I have to say is I felt very comfortable and happy with the size and quality if the room. I would recommend getting executive club access as it makes getting drunk cheaper and easier.

Overall I would absolutely recommend this hotel.

1,REDACTED,en,459,Hotel was fully booked so very busy. We were three adults so an extra bed in the room - but this made it incredibly small with no where to put anything. Bathroom was also very small - especially compared to the IC Hotels we stay at and the seat did not have the all the heating/washing options we had at all the other hotels we stayed at in Japan. We stocked up on snacks from the Family Mart down the street which made for a good late night snack on return from a busy day. At first they wanted to charge us for wi-fi in the room because I had not booked directly on the Hilton site - which is one of the reasons I normally don't bother with Hilton any more - they are one of the few major brands left that continue to charge for wi-fi - however the woman on the desk relented and gave us free wi-fi. There is a free shuttle from Shinjuku JR but we could not find it - gave up and took a taxi. Not sure if it is value for money as we simply slept there as we were out all day/evening and think I will stay with IC next time I am in Tokyo.

We arrived early after a very long flight and the hotel was kind enough to give us one room immediately on arrival. The concierge is so amazingly helpful. They will answer all your questions and rightfully guide you and even oblige you with restaurant reservations. They have a free shuttle to Shinjuku station every 20 minutes.

We had requested an early room and could not get it and email and service was less than responsive in pre-arrival, but the guest relations manager really went above and beyond in helping us with making things right.

The breakfast was excellent with dozens of Japanese and Western choices. The baked goods were fresh and delicious. The best part, however, was the staff. They could not have been friendlier or more accommodating.

The rooms notwithstanding, the service is beyond reproach. The concierge team is impeccable, as was the service everywhere in the hotel. The gym has treadmill and eliptical machines, so that was convenient. It isn't as in the middle of Shinjuku as I would have liked, but they have a shuttle to the Shinjuku station every twenty minutes, and that makes it easy.

The gym is still spacious but the layout is just not practical nor functional for resistance/weights training! The weights rack/area is moved to this tiny room no more than 10 sq ft (photo 1) and the rest of the weights/machines were placed at another area (photo 3 & 4) which is 15m away (photo 2) that makes it non-conducive for a workout. Guests were clamored for space in the tiny weights room, which can nearly hold more than 4 users. In all the years I have been in this hotel, the gym was always packed during peak hours (morning)!

Don't get me wrong, they still have an awesome selection of cardio machines, and still a great fitness center if the layout is to be re-designed (weights section) with the consideration/practicality of a gym (weights) users for cross-functional training.",2,2017/04/09

Our luggage sent to the hotel from Kyoto were late. Aoki, the Bell Desk staff went out of her way to contact the courier company to track down and personally brought to our room.

The aesthetic is clean and minimal combined with touches which emphasis the hotel's connection to Japanese art and culture. The high floor room was large and we had a great view of the entire city. The breakfast included in our rate was top notch featuring all of the best of typical American, European and Asian breakfast buffets. The staff were universally well trained, friendly and helpful.

The air conditioning was great which can be crucial in Tokyo during the Summer months.

Overall the hotel seemed better than its price point and is probably at the top end of the ""Hilton"" branded hotels in the world. I could live here!",5,2017/04/09
1,REDACTED,en,468,"As first time visitors to Japan, the Hilton Tokyo did not disappoint.The location was perfect, away from all the hustle and bustle and just a short 5 minute free shuttle bus ride to Shinjuku Station. We had two adjoining rooms to accommodate our family of four, which were comfortable and very clean. Breakfast and dinner at the Marble Lounge was delicious and satisfied the whole family.
But what made our holiday extra special was the wonderful staff at the concierge desk. A special mention to Sato, who helped us plan our day trips, offered restaurant recommendations and went out of her way to assist us locate our missing Disneyland tickets. Thank you for all your help and friendly smile Sato, it was really lovely to meet you and we are already planning another visit to Japan and Hilton Tokyo!",5,2017/04/08
1,REDACTED,en,469,"We booked the Hilton Shinjuku mostly due to its location. It was easy to get to from Haneda airport (we took the friendly limousine bus which took roughly 70 minutes) and several underground stations were in (underpass) walking distance. This was convenient although it was a 10 minutes walk to get to the subway lines.

We received a high floor room and the view was really great. The size of the room was good for Tokyo standards (especially compared to my stay at the tiny room at Unizo Shibuya). However, the bathroom was comparably small. With one sink, toilet, walk-in shower and bathtub you cannot use the bath with two pax at the same time. No problem for us though and we especially enjoyed the shower - since there are rooms with shower-in-tub layout.

Check-in, checkout and all members of staff in general were polite, helpful, smiling and efficient. Contrary to other reviews we had no lines at check in (we arrived in the morning) even though the hotel was fully booked (we did not receive a room upgrade as Diamond members)

We were very fortunate to have access to the executive & diamond lounge which we felt rendered the price/value ratio much more favorable. We had breakfast and pre dinner drinks in the lounge and it was fantastic. Actually, the breakfast selection down at the Marble Lounge felt not as good as in the lounge (although it's still a good breakfast).

We stayed four nights and would definitely come back. In my personal opinion the Hilton is a very good hotel, just not *exactly* 5 star (more like 4,5*) considering services like turndown service, fresh water, welcome amenities, etc that you might get in high-end 5-stars.

We are happy with the choice.",4,2017/04/08
1,REDACTED,en,470,"I stayed here for four nights at the end of November 2016. Shinjuku is a very good base for a tourist, and the Tokyo Hilton the best option in Shinjuku, starting with the fact that the airport limousine bus will drop you right at the hotel - important when you've just got off a long flight and need looking after. The newly refurbished executive floors are simply fantastic and the views amazing - I could see Mount Fuji from my room. The room rate was very reasonable for such a great location in a major world city. Service was excellent in every respect and I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",4,2017/04/08
1,REDACTED,en,471,"A nice spacious room with Park view. The hotel's location over a subway station is definitely a plus, so is the Shinjuku station shuttle service. Bar stinks of smoking so couldn't sit there... too bad

1,REDACTED,en,472,"I stayed here one night while in Tokyo. The room was very spacious, especially for Japan. Everything was clean and comfortable. The hotel itself was very crowded though, and the lobby always seemed to be full. The location was very good, I would just walk to most of the sights around Shinjuku, though you could take a shuttle if you wanted to.",5,2017/04/07
1,REDACTED,en,473,"Being a diamond Hilton Honors member you would think they would ensure that they treat us well however not only did they put us in a smoking room, but then accused us of being at fault since we selected the room using the online check-in app. 

The app only provided us with two rooms to choose from which didn't notify us that it was a smoking room. In addition to this when the room was booked we specifically requested non-smoking.

They then told us that there are no more rooms available and that we would have to sleep in the rooms overnight before they could change our rooms. It wasn't only until after I complained stating that I wouldn't sleep in a room that smells of smoke that they found us a room that we would be able to sleep in but would have to leave by 8am the next morning due to another guest having to move in. Regardless of the fact that when we came to check in earlier at around 12pm we were told our room wasn't ready (if we were able to see the room earlier would have been able to notify them of the issue).

Great way to treat your guests Hilton....

I'd hate to think how they would have treated someone in this position if they didn't have any HHonors status at all.",1,2017/04/07
1,REDACTED,en,474,"Though not in the heart of hustle and bustle Shinjuku, Hilton is only steps (5 min-walk) away from two different Tokyo Metro stops. Also the hotel's complimentary shuttle service to Shinjuku station is quite convenient. The quality of breakfast offered during my stay is way above the average hotel complimentary breakfast. The whole family enjoyed the traditional Japanese style of breakfast very much. The room (Jr. Executive Suite) itself is spacious compared to other Tokyo hotels (even with a tub!). It's definitely a good option for a family of 3 or 4 to stay.",5,2017/04/06
1,REDACTED,en,475,"The service culture in this hotel is just outstanding and throughout our stay we were looked after in true Hilton style. Mr Shimamune, director of rooms recommended a very good, authentic Japanese restaurant in walking distance, it was quite an experience and a superb introduction to Japanese cuisine. 
The hotel is a busy place, the lobby always bustling with people, great buffet with strawberries in season, also they offer a Japanese breakfast in typical local fashion.
Overall it was an excellent stay",5,2017/04/06
1,REDACTED,en,476,"This high-rise chain hotel was home for three nights in March and was a revelation: despite its typical Hilton look and feel, every detail for the duration of our stay was just perfect. The spacious, luxurious and elegant room with its beautiful Japanese bathroom features was a welcome haven at the end of every action-packed day. The enormous bed with its Frette linen was immaculate and crisp—best nights’ sleep we have ever had. The Japanese breakfast experience was unforgettable – a rare and unusual treat and beautifully executed. And staff were without exception among the friendliest, most professional and helpful we encountered in Japan – including the way-beyond-the-call-of-duty detailed arrangements and directions from a manager that gave us our first-ever (but certainly not the last!) very authentic Robata dining experience . . . Thanks, everyone, for making our Tokyo visit so comfortable and easy! We’ll definitely be back!",5,2017/04/06
1,REDACTED,en,477,"Hilton Tokyo is a busy hotel with many guests. Service staff always manage to give you a big smile despite being very busy. Front desk lady are courteous and attempts to do some small chat with you.

Breakfast is decent. Whats worth mentioning is there is a special Japanese breakfast that you can order in advance with limited seatings if you book a club lounge room. This definitely separates the hotel from the usual mundane standard buffet breakfast.

Room is very big and comfortable for Junior suite. I heard they have been recently renovated. It has modern japanese elements fused in room decor.

Location-- its right at subway so very convenient to go anywhere.

Hotel is very helpful. I originally booked an extra non refundable room and they allow me to do a cancellation out of good will. Greatly appreciates it.",5,2017/04/05

1,REDACTED,en,479,Good sized rooms with sitting area and bath as part of upgrade. Used Hilton Points and was given access to executive lounge. Restaurants were expensive but similar to this type of facility in Tokyo. Staff was very helpful. Good airport bus connections to Narita.,5,2017/04/05
1,REDACTED,en,480,"We have been to plenty of high profile hotels in the past 5 or 6 years and as a first Hilton experience, Hilton Tokyo, would make it to quite a nice 4 star hotel. 

However, unfortunately it would miss out on some and maybe most of the qualities to give you the touch and feel of a 5 star hotel. 

A mediocre executive lounge breakfast or even staff vacuuming after breakfast hours when we wanted to grab a tea and relax wasn't something to die for. In contrast we had an amazing experience with the Japanese breakfast we have booked on the 2nd floor.

I'm general very clean and spacious rooms ( the 2nd more standing out for a hotel in Tokyo ) and also a direct covered access from a Nishi-Shinjuku station nearby were the highlights.",4,2017/04/05
1,REDACTED,en,481,"We have been to Tokyo on numerous times all of which we have stayed at the Hilton Shinjuku. We have had nothing but an absolutely amazing and welcoming experience every time we go. The rooms we stayed in were suites and are spacious and clean with great views out the windows of Tokyo. They have a executive lounge which has a cocktail and canapé time in the early evening serving delicious drinks and canapés. It can get busy but there are enough seats it seems to provide the experience to all with lounge access.
We ate at the metropolitan Grill as well this time within the hotel and it was probably the best meal of our life.
The breakfast every morning at the buffet is delicious with an array of choices and a delicious juice bar.
I would highly recommend this hotel and we are already planning our return early next year now.",5,2017/04/04
1,REDACTED,en,482,This is the 2nd time we have stayed at this property. We took the Friendly Limousine Bus from Narita airport which stops directly in front of the Hilton Tokyo. Check in was quick despite it being quite busy when we arrived. Digital check in allowed us to select our room prior to arrival. We stayed in the executive king room - extremely spacious and great amenities. The executive lounge was also great - we had the breakfast and drinks service during our stay. Great quality of food. The concierge staff also helped with restaurant bookings. Would definitely recommend this property.,4,2017/04/04
1,REDACTED,en,483,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Hilton Tokyo for four nights. Overall, we were very happy with the hotel. The room was nice and we had a great city view. The only English-speaking TV channels were news shows, and rather repetitive ones at that. 

The concierge team was outstanding. They didn’t just have one overworked concierge, they usually had three people and we never had to wait long. We asked them questions at least four times and every time they were great.

There isn’t much in the immediate area, but there is a shuttle that comes every 20 minutes or so to Shinjuku Station. We tried walking, but immediately got lost, plus it was freezing. We found that having to take the shuttle cut down on our spontaneity because everything needed to be planned out, so that was one thing we didn’t like.
Breakfast was included in our stay and it was excellent. It was thoughtful of them to start the continental breakfast before the cooked breakfast so those who needed to leave earlier than the posted breakfast hours could eat. We took advantage of that a few times.

All in all, an excellent stay.",5,2017/04/03

1,REDACTED,en,485,"I made a reservation at Hilton Tokyo! I saw a lower rate at another website and submitted a best rate guarantee claim online. I did not receive any reply within 24 hours as advertised on Hilton's website. I followed up using the online form. I got an email the next day from a Reservation Supervisor of Hilton Tokyo stating my original reservation with Hilton is free cancellation, it is no problem if I prefer to book at the third party website. I called the toll free number to speak to the Best Rate Guarantee Group to clarify if my claim is denied and why. I spoke to Jennifer. She told me that the supervisor at the hotel should not have contacted or replied to my claim. The decision should be made by the BRG team. She did not know why the supervisor at the hotel sent me that email. She said she will escalate this issue to the manager of BRG group and I should receive a decision about my claim within several hours. I waited for 12 hours. No reply was received. I followed up by phone again. This time I spoke with another agent, Shaun. She told me that I should wait for another day to see if the BRG group would reply. I read other people's unpleasant experience related to Hilton's BRG process from another website as well as trip advisor here. One person mentioned it actually took over 20 emails before Hilton agreeing to honour the BRG.

1,REDACTED,en,486,"This hotel is exactly what you'd expect from a Hilton in Tokyo. The common spaces of the hotel are huge and often very crowded with Japanese and international tourists. This has a feel of a large, convention center based hotel. The hallways and facilities are outdated. The rooms are very nice, clean, updated, and bright. There is a continental breakfast that is very nice - just be careful if going during peak hours 8-9am you may be seated in the overflow smoking bar area that smells heavily of musty cigarettes. The executive club lounge here is nice with descent food and drinks. Wine and cocktails are available 6-830pm. Soda, water, and beer are available during all open hours. This hotel is near the subway station - you are a 5-10 minute walk to the nearest stop and from there - Tokyo is at your fingertips.

1,REDACTED,en,504,"The absolute worst customer service I've ever received at a Hilton hotel. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE from the concierge and front desk team.

My new husband and I stayed at the Hilton Tokyo for 6 nights on our Japan honeymoon and they made sure we wouldn't forget this hotel in the most negative way possible. 

On our last night, we decided to stay in and order delivery from an outside service. Our delivery arrived at 10:30pm and we received an email stating the hotel would not let them in and the food could not be delivered. What's troubling to my husband and I is that no one contacted us to tell us they turned our delivery away when we could have gone downstairs to pick it up. We called the front desk and they blamed concierge, then proceeded to transfer me to room service. We went downstairs to the front desk and the front desk told us to go the concierge. The concierge, Motohashi, tried to ""help"" us by fiddling with his computer and calling the delivery service back. After 35 minutes of arguing with the delivery service, they decided the company was not going to redeliver. I asked the concierge next to him, Murakami, if he could call the manager. He got on the phone and started talking in Japanese and laughing. This made me feel very terrible and I made sure to tell him that and he smiled. Murakami was of no help and went on his computer to stay away from our situation. My husband stayed with the concierge and I went to the front desk to ask for a manager. The night manager, Taniguchi, came out 10 minutes later and seemed as if he already knew our situation. The concierge told him that they already allowed the delivery service in, which was NOT AT ALL what happened and there was a serious miscommunication. By this point, it was close to an hour since our food had originally arrived. Taniguchi offered to give us 50% off the room service menu. This angered us even more because we made a conscious effort to not order from room service because of how expensive it was. Then after some argument, he offered us a better deal that would feed us for the night. He walked us up to our room and awkwardly invited himself in to watch us look at the menu and reiterate the situation by saying it was miscommunication between the concierge, him and us. Wtf. It was terrible and this is our lasting impression of the Hilton Tokyo. Our food arrived at 12:15am.

Along with this situation, the shower door is a terrible design; a less than half glass door that allows all the water to fall on the floor while you shower. The bidet is great, although it doesn't have the seat warmer unlike the Hilton Tokyo Odaiba and Sheraton Grande Bay Tokyo. 

Some good things about this trip, we were gifted a bottle of wine to celebrate our honeymoon and had a king bed on the 33rd floor. The shuttle to shinjuku station is helpful and the underground tunnel passage to the train station is a great perk. Location is away from the crowds.

All in all, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone celebrating anything. They will find a way to make your stay an unpleasant one.",1,2017/03/26
1,REDACTED,en,505,"The Hilton at Nishi- Shinjuku has been around a long, long time. But it does not show its age, having been updated several times and meticulously maintained in between. The staff are very good, very professional and always ready to help the guest in any way. I was treated very well there, and I am not at any special level with the Hilton program.
The room was great, spotlessly clean and up- to- date. The bed linens and towels were top- notch. There was also a great view of the first corner of the start of the Tokyo Marathon.
The food is classic Hilton, which I think has the best food for a major hotel chain. They really put a lot of effort in and it shows.
Location: superb. For joggers, the Shinjuku Central Park is across an intersection. The hotel is a 900m walk (a bit more than ½ mile) from Shinjuku Station, the world’s busiest train station, about half that distance from the Oedo subway line’s Tochomae station, and even closer to the Nishi- Shinjuku station of the Marunouchi subway line. The hotel runs a shuttle us to Shinjuku Station, where you can get JR, Odakyu and Keio train lines. There is also access there to the JR Narita Express. To get to Haneda Airport, it’s a toss- up between taking the Oedo line to Daimon (Hamamatsuchou) and connecting to the monorail, vs. taking the JR Yamanote line to Shinagawa and connecting to the Keisei Haneda Express train.

1,REDACTED,en,517,"Stayed 3 nights with wife and baby. Excellent suite. Very accomodating staff. Japanese Breakfast was great. Executive lounge can be a little too busy at times. Decent location, few minutes walk to subway and 10 minute walk to Shinjuku station. I would not hesitate to choose this hotel again when in Tokyo.",5,2017/03/15
1,REDACTED,en,518,"This Hilton property is everything you would expect from a downtown location in Asia. The elegant well dressed staff welcomes you at the door. The Front Desk staff is very friendly and helpful. The luggage was brought up as soon as we checked in. I mentioned it in my Conrad Hilton's review: don't be surprised if a girl delivers your bags. They are mostly girls taking care of luggage and they seem to enjoy it. The standard rooms are cozy and sufficient. Not big rooms but exactly what you need in Asia. Clean and well maintained which is important. I enjoyed the bathroom and how cool the shower is! Great city views from the rooms. 
This hotel has a fabulous selection of food. From the bar to the restaurants and the desserts, everything is really good. The breakfast was my favorite time of the day. Wonderful selection and service. 
The hotel has a tennis court and even in February people were having fun outside hitting some balls with the rackets. 
There's a free shuttle service to the main metro station. You can walk around this area and go shopping or walk to the nearest park. The location is absolutely great for walking and seeing the most of downtown.
If you are a Hilton Honors member and have access to the Executive lounge, I really enjoyed this one. They have a great area and the view from there is outstanding. We saw the most beautiful sunset of the trip. 
If you don't have access to the lounge just try to get an even number room (opposite to the entrance). Our room was facing the entrance which was still a nice view. 
I loved this property and the staff was the best! Ernest at the Front Desk made our check in smooth and enjoyable. He has a great attitude all the time.
A very special thank you to Ari, who made our trip just Memorable. He gave us the best tips and suggestions on how to enjoy Tokyo to the max. His charisma and professionalism are one of a kind. Ari is a gem and we look forward to seeing him when we return. 

Note: Remember not to tip. This is not part of the Japanese culture. 

Must try: The fresh juice at the Breakfast in the Lobby restaurant. 

Enjoy!",5,2017/03/13
1,REDACTED,en,519,"I stayed two nights at Hilton Tokyo hotel last weekend and I have to say, this was by far, one of the best Hilton property I have ever experienced. As Hilton Gold member, I got upgraded to executive room which was at the 31st floor which had lounge access. Rooms are larger than usual Tokyo hotels and quite new due to the recent renovation. The view was beautiful overseeing the skyline of Shinjuku buildings. The lounge was great, seemed a little small considering total number of rooms, however served nice selection of beverages which I enjoyed very much. Every staffs I encountered were very polite and professional. I had no problem speaking English with hotel staffs and everyone was all eager to help me especially those at the front desk and concierge desk. I want to come back again soon.",5,2017/03/13
1,REDACTED,en,520,One of the advantages of staying here is that the Airport Limo Bus takes you from Narita to the Hotel with no need to take your bags up and down stairs and escalators. The rooms are big and very comfortable with a modern Japanese design. We had access to the Executive lounge where the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Shout out to Waki who suggested several places for us to visit on a Sunday- we were able to see 3 Japanese brides in traditional dress - just beautiful. One option for Executive lounge members is to enjoy a traditional Japanese breakfast in Junisho (the restaurant) so make the reservation and experience it. The hotel has a convenient shuttle to Shinjuki station where you can shop - there is a high Takashimiya there.,5,2017/03/13
1,REDACTED,en,521,The Hilton Shinjuku is a beautiful hotel with top-notch hospitality. That experience is enhanced even more if you have the opportunity for repeat visits. The staff will get to know your preferences and will take care of them cheerfully. I highly recommend this hotel. The lounge is a great environment with a commanding view of Shinjuku. Clear days allow for a nice view of Mount Fuji as well.,5,2017/03/13
1,REDACTED,en,522,"My second stay here – Still exceptional in every way. 

Some new Hotel staff stars and stand out performers Ernesto and Rinna Hotel guest relations brilliance, friendly, accessible and savvy ! You’re in excellent hands here. It was January -1 degree outside at times, yet warm and tranquil and fully catered inside.

The executive lounge was again perfect and absolutely essential component of our stay you have to be organised though or you will miss out on the best seats. This time as I had my girlfriend with me I switched to the lobby breakfast every morning it was exceptional and thorough . 

Hilton Tokyo is the perfect place to relax and recover from Air travel ! pamper yourself and prepare if your heading out into wild Japan. We borrowed some movies from the exec lounge DVD catalogue ordered some in room dining, stayed warm used the gym & pool, went shopping, back and forth in the Hilton shuttle to Shinjuku. Yoyogi park is close by and vast with temples and centuries old trees and on the other side you can access Harajuku for fashion shopping and Shibuya for entertainment not far. 
JRrail pass it back to Shinjuku. Hilton Shuttles not far away, or waiting ! 
Underground shopping walkway connect Shinjuku to the metropolitan tower too, which you must go up to the viewing level it’s such a gobsmacking view of all of Tokyo - its 5 min walk back to Hilton from here and I think it was free.

5 star Bliss - 5 star friendly staff – A Cocoon of luxury & warmth ! The massive city view suites are just so comfortable great bath and other room facilities, awesome views - high up in the sky ! 

My favourite Luxury City Hotel on the planet! Can’t wait to come back !",5,2017/03/13

1,REDACTED,en,524,"Tokyo Hilton in Shinjuku

*Service and Staff: As is very common with the Asian standard of customer service, the staff and service were just ridiculously awesome! So good! 


*Room: Perfect blend of Japanese culture and modern décor. One of the best in the Hilton system. The room has a contemporary Japanese style that feels both luxurious as well subtle. Honestly, the Hilton hotels in Japan have some of the greatest appeal to me. From entry into the room to the rice paper window coverings and hard black out shutter doors, the room feels like you are getting what you are paying for but also does not boast. The luxuries are subtle but most definitely there. As far as plugs go, there are two US compatible outlets behind the table and also one next to the bed. There are two additional USB power slots. The iron is awesome, but is labeled in Japanese. Have Google translate app loaded on your phone! If this reads just like my Osaka and Nagoya review because…the rooms are identical. 


*Bed: Firm but not too “Asian firm.” Very comfortable with a medium firm pillow and a medium weight comforter. 


*Bathroom: Love this bathroom as it continues with the contemporary luxuries of the room, but again, does not seem over the top. There is plenty of counter space, one outlet, a hair dryer, a western style shower head AND an Asian style wand. The best part of this bathroom is the fully electric TOTO toilet/bidet with a heated seat and remote control. One disappointment was the towels. They were far too rough and scratchy for a ‘luxury’ brand hotel. The best part of this room was the high quality wireless iron and the hard, sliding blackout window shades. The outlets are also US compatible. The air condition was very sufficient. 


*Bed: The bed was a little on the hard side, but still very comfortable. Comforter was light to medium in weight. 


*Bathroom: Clean and modern. My room had the Japanese electric toilet seat with bidet and heated seat. The shower uses the Asian style shower wand. 


*Gym: 

-Free weights: Dumbbells 

-Cardio: 4 Treadmills, 3 bikes, 2 recumbent bikes, 4 ellipticals

-Olympic: None

-Functional: Ab Balls, mats

-Machines: Smith machines and full complement of PRECOR machines for a full body workout. 


*Dining: Did not try.


*Location: About a 10-15 minute walk from Shinjuku station and the restaurant, shopping, bar district beyond the station. There is not a lot in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. 


*Recommend restaurant /bar/ site: Robot Restaurant. Google it!! **** Most local restaurants and bars accept cash only. The ATMs are in the Family Mart and 7 Elevens. It is NOT convenient to test all the ATMs for compatibility. Recommend bringing cash from the airport. There is an ATM at the hotel, but I did not try it.

1,REDACTED,en,525,"I've had 2 separate one night stays, with the first one in late January and the second one early February 2017 at this property.
The first time I stayed at the hotel alone, the second time with three friends (we had booked two rooms).

My 1st stay:
Checking in went quite okay, however I couldn't find a priority check-in counter for Hilton Gold and Diamond members, hence I waited a few minutes before it was my turn.
I had booked a standard room (using HHonors points) and as a Hilton Diamond member I was upgraded to a City King Suite, however only after some ""mild coercion"".
The room was spacious, clean and appeared to be quite new. The bathroom was spacious, and the sofa / living room area was sufficiently large as well.
When I thought I'd drop by the executive lounge for a quick drink around 6pm, I was rather surprised to find a queue of approx. 14-15 people waiting outside the exeutive lounge.
Upon having a closer look, this was the queue to check in with the executive lounge desk, and then there was another queue sort of inside the lounge with people waiting to be seated.
The hotel representatives as the desk were very apologetic, and provided me with a voucher so that I could enjoy my cocktail hour in the hotel bar instead. Fair enough, but I missed out on the nice views of the city from the lounge.

My 2nd stay:
My friend and I had booked a two bed standard room and we got upgraded to a Deluxe double bed room. Fair enough, as I understand there aren't that many hotels with higher room categories that have two beds.
Again I was very happy with the room, which also appeared to be quite new and was sufficiently spacious (at least by Tokyo standards).
Just before 6pm I went up the the executive lounge, thinking I'd secure a nice table for my two colleagues and I. Again, the lounge was packed, however luckily there wasn't that many people queueing this time.
I was seated at one of the high tables (with bar stools) and made an agreement with one of the representatives that I would be granted a nicer table once one opened up.
Having been sitting there for only 6-7 minutes or so, one of the tables (with comfortable lounge chairs and a sofa) close to the entrance to the lounge became available.
I immediately proceeded trying to get eye contact with the hotel staff member I made the agreement with, thinking my two friends who had yet to arrive would be very happy with our seating arrangement.
What happened next baffled me. A group of four young (twenty something) Japanese people arrived at the lounge, and they were promptly seated at the available table in question.
I am aware that Europeans / white people are not welcome in e.g. all kinds of restaurants / night clubs etc. in Japan, however I thought this could not happen in an international hotel of a certain format.
On top of this, it seemed as if the warm food buffet was never replenished. At least all three times when I checked, the trays were empty for the duration of approx. an hour or so. Of course I could have been unlucky with my timing visiting the warm food buffet...
While waiting I also overheard the front desk staff telling arriving guests that the lounge was at capacity and they suggesting the guests waiting in their hotel rooms for the exeutive front desk to call them if a table opened up. This is an abysmal way to treat paying customers in my opnion, keeping in memory my first visit when at least I got a voucher with me for the hotel bar!

Location wise this hotel is nicely situated in the Shinjuku area.
Personally I think the most convenient way to travel from Narita Airport to the hotel is the hotel's shuttle bus service. It takes 80-90 minutes, and costs 3100 JPY (if memory serves correctly).
On the airport is first come first served, however there was never a shortage of available seats. If you want to take the shuttle bus back to any of the two airports, you need to book in advance with the hotel.

To sum things up:
- It is not worth the extra money to pay for rooms with executive lounge benefits
- Rooms are nice, clean and provides the necessary space for a wary traveller
- I'm a bit concerned as to whether or not Europeans receive the same respect as people originating from the country

Will I be staying at this property on my next visit to Tokyo? No - most likely not, and mainly due to my experiences in the executive lounge. Instead I will probably see how e.g. the Conrad Tokyo hotel treat their Hilton Diamond members on my next visit.",2,2017/03/10
1,REDACTED,en,526,"Stayed as part of a tour package with extra days added on (7 nights total). It is a fantastic property with everything you need especially after a long flight. We splurged on Executive Level floor but it is so worth it, from the well-stocked breakfast (incl chef to make customized omelets and fresh squeezed orange juice) to the afternoon coffee breaks and evening cocktails with appetizers. Views are amazing and the staff caring and attentive. Room was spacious with huge shower and deep tub, comfortable bed/pillows and high quality linens and amenities.

The lobby has only seating for about 4 people. Could never figure this out. The location is not as good as Hyatt as it is further from Shinjuku station. Go to Old Toyko for sightseeing. In fact, stay in that area.",5,2017/03/09
1,REDACTED,en,529,"The hotel is in a good location, near Nishi-Shinjuku station. We used this station to get to most places instead of using the shuttle to Shinjuku station as Shinjuku station can get quite confusing. The shuttle gets quite full so it would be good to queue a few minutes beforehand.

We stayed in a king Hilton room, which was a perfect size for my husband and I. The bathroom was on the small side, even when compared to other Japanese hotels we've stayed in. 

Prior to arrival, we requested for a special pillow from their pillow menu and an extra towel, which were all in the room when we arrived.

We ordered room service a couple of times and the food arrived promptly every time. Buffet breakfast was good but could have had more choices.

Special mention to the hotel laundry - they sewed a button onto my shirt even though I did not ask them to mend it.",5,2017/03/08
1,REDACTED,en,530,I stayed for 4 days and enjoyed the stay.

All of the staff here are helpful and speak English well, and I would particular want to thank Ms Michelle Hoshino at its front desk who provided efficient and friendly services and advices on areas from room selection, late check-out, to food and shopping suggestions. Ms Hoshino san and other great staff is one key reason why I choose to stay with Hilton.

Room was classy and sleek. Our son dropped a glass cup onto the marble bathroom floor so we called downstairs to have someone to come in and clean it. The cavalry arrived within 3 minutes and 5 minutes later all the broken pieces of glass were dealt with. Outstanding!

There is only a few sitting space in the lobby although many guests are waiting on the line and some guests sit on the no sitting place of restaurant inevitably. The elevators are controlled well and comes anytime soon. The guest room is small but rather above average space in Shinjuku area. The room maintenance is fine.

1,REDACTED,en,547,"We unfortunately only were here for one night, but it was exceptional. We came from NRT airport by train then took the free shuttle from the train station (though there is also a bus (called a limousine bus) that brings you right to the door). Location was nice- about a 5 minute walk from restaurants, etc. Only 2 blocks from the metro. Tokyo is huge- we took the metro to the fish market and it took about 30 minutes. 
Back to the hotel, the room was modern, clean and comfortable with a beautiful view. We have status with Hilton, so we also had club access which was wonderful. 
We also enjoyed breakfast the next morning- it had several fresh options, japanese and western choices. I highly recommend this hotel (much nicer than many of the Hiltons I have stayed at in the U.S.). Staff was helpful, professional and friendly.
We liked the location, but it depends what you will be doing in the city. You may consider staying near the attractions you plan to visit. 
We did not check out any of the amenities not listed in the review.",5,2017/02/21

1,REDACTED,en,550,"I have not even checked out yet and I want to tell you all how great this place is. After a nightmare with an illegal Airbnb listing, I bit the bullet and booked 6 nights here for the last leg of our trip. We have stayed in Hiltons before in the US but nothing compares to it here.

We were greeted with a beautiful man who knew a plethora of languages and checked in. They told us about the complimentary shuttle to and from Shinjuku station (8 minutes away) every 20 minutes as well as the airport limousine. 

The room is huge and was very refreshing after living out of our suitcases in small hotel rooms for close to a week. The view isn't amazing but you can still tell it's Japan. As one reviewer said, it's away from the hustle and bustle of the city but still close enough. My SO was happy to be greeted with a few channels in English and the free wifi was a nice break for our wifi egg.

Some good things to take note of nearby:
-Police station
-Access to Marunochi line from lobby underground
-24 hour convenience store underground
- 7Eleven a block away
- Natural Lawson's (EVEN BETTER) has medicine and organic foods
-McDonalds
-24 hour laundromat

The issue this time was the executive lounge. It was so crowded and overfilled I was told to go and wait in my room and they would call me when/if it was any seat available!! This is access people indirectly pay for by booking executive rooms, so this is not acceptable. The lounge also lacked food and snacks. It was not refilled. So this was surprisingly below par. The staff did nothing to try to correct the situation. I will NOT visit this property again.",1,2017/02/13
1,REDACTED,en,557,"My father and I stayed here on our first trip to Tokyo. We are partial to staying at Hilton Hotels and our stay here only reinforced that idea. Thanks to his being a rewards member they upgraded us to a nicer room in a very quick process right when we got to the hotel explaining everything very efficiently. 
The dining selection was good but the highlight was the exclusive dining options offered to Hilton Gold status members. We had our own quieter more intimate dining area on like the 27th floor and nearby we also had a smaller exclusive bar area as well. Be aware that the restaurants on the bottom floor are a little on the pricier side but that's about par for the course in most Tokyo restaurants of that quality. On a different note all of the areas had these cool automatic air freshener dispensers that dispensed the best smelling air freshener ever.
The hotel offers a swimming pool, a nice work out area that includes a smith machine and free-weights, and to my surprise a tennis court (though you need to have your own racquets). 
The room we stayed in was a suite that had a spacious bathroom, a large sectional couch, and two slightly larger than twin sized beds that were probably the comfiest beds I've ever stayed in and I'm not just saying that because I was sleep deprived. The bathroom was pretty sweet with a tub and a shower but most importantly it had a futuristic Japanese toilet with a heated seat and a function that sprayed deodorizer into the toilet after every 5 minutes of sitting there.
Last but not least the concierge was exceedingly helpful with all the strange requests and question we had for him on our first trip for Tokyo whether it was finding out about where to buy certain things to which local sites to visit. Most impressively he was able to map us out clear directions from our hotel to Tokyo Disney by way of the subway.
I would highly recommend the Hilton Tokyo in Shinjuku. It is definitely on the pricier side but you certainly are getting what you paid for with this hotel.",5,2017/02/13

1,REDACTED,en,559,"I don't usually choose a hotel chain but there was a sale going on for suites and my cousin had gone ahead to make reservations for her parents and herself, and all six of us wanted to be in the same hotel. (We had originally planned to be at a more centrally located hotel like the Century Southern Tower.) Anyway, we followed suit and booked a king suite for my brother and a junior suite for my mum and me, and we paid upfront three months in advance for our 10-night stay (26 January - 5 February). I kept my fingers crossed as it was my first time staying at a Hilton hotel (a restaurant experience at the Hilton Paddington in London some time back had left much to be desired); however, several years ago, I had stayed at the Conrad in Bangkok and that was lovely.

The pros:

- A welcome note from the GM Michael Williamson and a generous fruit platter of strawberries and blueberries, a small box of chocolates and some madeleines. 

- Spacious rooms with all the usual amenities and a nice city view. I liked the impressively expansive sofa which was perfect for lounging around. 

- The Executive Lounge on the 37th floor that provided a more exclusive space for guests, with great views of the city and Fuji san (Mount Fuji) over breakfast, afternoon tea and pre-dinner drinks and snacks. (My mum enjoyed the onsen egg and free-flow of champagne, while my favourite was the superb dashi that went with the soba served on certain evenings!)

- As it got quite monotonous after a few days and nights of having almost identical meals at the Executive Lounge, it was wonderful of the staff to offer us an additional option of having the delightful Japanese breakfast at Junisoh on the second floor.

- Professional, English-speaking staff on the 37th floor. One evening, as the older folks were just too tired to do much, we had the help of a most obliging lady who arranged to have a few dishes delivered from Chinese restaurant Dynasty. (I think she was bespectacled and I can't remember her name, but she really smoothened matters by acceding to our unusual, last minute request.) Two others with easier names to recall were Andrea and Makoto, who also helped with occasional requests such as restaurant reservations. The concierge staff at the lobby were also helpful with tour bookings. 

- Hiltopia with its shops and the 24-hour convenience store as well as the Hilton shuttle bus were especially useful for the senior folks to explore and get around comfortably. The shuttle bus would pick up and drop off hotel guests between the hotel and the Shinjuku station area at 20-minute intervals.

- Two subway lines (Marunouchi and Oedo) for quicker access to other parts of Tokyo. 

- Many restaurants in the vicinity, including a few within the Hilton itself. We not only had breakfast at Junisoh but also enjoyed two delightful Teppanyaki dinners there. 

The cons/""areas for improvement"":

- We would have loved a higher floor for our junior suite. A room three levels higher on the 14th floor wasn't ready upon check-in, and interestingly, it ended up being our cousin's when she arrived a day later. The king suite was on the 18th floor and that was fine, although the hotel has close to 40 floors.

- The bathrooms were a bit small, although I know we're talking about Tokyo here. All the same, I can't help thinking that the rooms at the Granvia Kyoto were a lot more spacious (bathrooms and wide-ranging toiletries too!) and they weren't even suites. 

- Whilst the cleaners were obliging the couple of times we bumped into them, we found the cleaning somewhat inconsistent in terms of thoroughness. The bin under the writing desk was sometimes not emptied. 

- While a crowded hotel lobby may have been evidence of a popular hotel, I found the area could have benefited from better crowd control. 

- We telephoned from our room for help with our luggage as we prepared to leave the hotel on 5 February, but the bell hop never came. We waited a while but ended up struggling a little with the luggage as we didn't want to miss our prepaid limo bus ride to Narita airport. (I say we struggled because I had my 77-year-old mother with me and we had four pieces of luggage.)

With hindsight, literally for ""a change of scenery"", we could have, at least for a few nights, tried a more centrally located hotel that makes time-consuming shuttle bus rides unnecessary. We also could have stayed a couple of nights in Hakone or some place more scenic and tranquil, away from the mad rush. 

All in all, we enjoyed our stay. It certainly helped that the rooms were pleasant and comfortable, that there was Executive Lounge access, that there were obliging English-speaking staff and that there was enough in and around the hotel to keep the senior folks in our group sufficiently entertained. ありがとうございます！

1,REDACTED,en,562,This is our first time stay with Hilton Tokyo. We booked a suite during promotion period and received a room upgrade when check-in. The suite is very spacious. Staff were very friendly and helpful to accommodate our family. The executive lounge was very relaxed and comfortable. We did enjoy our stay very much.,5,2017/02/08
1,REDACTED,en,563,We had room 3704 for five nights in January 2017 - it had a great view of Mt Fuji. Easier to have breakfast in the Exec lounge rather than the main dining area on the ground floor. Not as much range but quiet and peaceful. Lunch and dinner there were excellent. Food and beverages were first rate. Great room and bathroom. Hotel is located in a very spacious part of Tokyo. Some areas are quite dense with buildings close together but the Hilton is in a newer commercial area. Easy access to trains. Tokyo Medical University Hospital nearby means you might hear ambulance sirens and strange vocal warnings from ambulance drivers on loudspeakers - a bit noisy at night even when there is little traffic. Otherwise perfect.,5,2017/02/07
1,REDACTED,en,564,"The Tokyo Hilton is situated a stone's throw from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Buildings, and is close to both Nishishinjuku and Tochomae metro stations. Both metro stations are linked to the hotel by underground passages, and the hotel also offers a courtesy shuttle between the hotel and Shinjuku station (running every 20 minutes).

The suite I was booked into was large, with a large reception room separated from the bedroom. While the bathroom and WC was a good size, the bath tub was actually smaller than the usual Western-sized bath tub.

Booking into a suite also provided access to the Executive Lounge on the 37th Floor of the hotel, which offers daily breakfast, afternoon tea, as well as pre-dinner drinks. The hotel also offers two bottles of drinking water, and free wifi.

While the distance from Shinjuku makes things less convenient (you cannot quite walk downstairs to find all the shops), the hotel has a small arcade Hiltopia just by the hotel. Staff are friendly and helpful, and speak English, which is helpful to those who do not speak Japanese.",3,2017/02/07
1,REDACTED,en,565,Definitely reccommend booking in an execyetive suite for the included extras of pre-dinner drinks and nibbles as well as choice of 2 breakfasts. Also helps to be a Hhonors member for access to the premium wi-fi.,5,2017/02/06

1,REDACTED,en,567,"We stayed here for a couple of nights. The service was great. Altogether GH we arrived before checkin time they made the effort to give us a room early. The hotel is situated about a 10-15 minute easy walk from shinjuku station and is also connected via underground tunnels to two subway stations. There is also a free shuttle between the hotel and shinjuku station that leaves every 20 minutes a It's close to office buildings and away from the main shopping area of shinjuku. Hence it is in a more quiet area. 
The rooms themselves are relatively big for Tokyo standard although the bathroom was a little small. Everything was new and very clean.",4,2017/02/03
1,REDACTED,en,568,I stayed at the hotel for 5 days. The service and rooms are excellent. The restaurants are superb. The executive lounge on floor 37 served a very good breakfast and was a good place to land at night. It is very close to the train station and a short taxi ride to Haneda airport.,5,2017/02/02
1,REDACTED,en,569,"We stayed here for 2 nights. This is a Hilton so the room is comparable to the ones in the U.S. It has a japanese touch, including its toilet. 

Breakfast buffet is plenty bountiful but I think it is less on meat choices. If you are on a budget, there is a supermarket nearby that sells ready to eat food for $4-$6. Dennys and starbucks are also a block away.

The hotel is connected to subway station. But if you need to go to Shinjuku station, there is a shuttle bus. Stop#21 in front of Keio dept. store. There is a Hilton hotel sign. 

It took me a while to find it because I was disoriented with the place. There are a few dept store and many different train stations.",5,2017/02/02
1,REDACTED,en,570,"From check in to departure, none of the Hilton employees could have done more to make my stay, as a first time visitor to Japan, more comfortable. 

The hotel is vast, yet when they are serving you or explaining something the staff have that skill of making you feel important and the only person that matters.

The Exec lounges be refreshments on offer were very nice and breakfast with a Mount Fuji view a particular delight.

The hotel is not in the centre of things exactly but then again I'm not sure what you'd describe as the centre of Tokyo... hotel bus to Shinjuku station or a short walk to 2 other subway line stations were convenient for getting anywhere.

My room, a junior suite on 33rd floor, was perfectly decent and well equipped.

I used the gym which was fine but not the pool (which you can see through to from the gym). I thought the pool looked a bit small.

Very happy with my choice of hotel... if there's better in the city at similar rates, they would have to be exceptional.",5,2017/02/01

1,REDACTED,en,572,"Always a pleasure coming back to Hilton Tokyo! At check in, the staff acknowledged my HHonors Diamond status and welcomed me back to the hotel. As I checked in very early, I could not expect to be given a room till the normal check in time of 3pm. I was asked to relax in the Executive Lounge and/or to freshen up at the Fitness Centre on level 5.

The view of Mount Fuji from the Executive Lounge is amazing and I could spend hours starring at it :) I have to commend Andrea-san and the team at the Executive Lounge for keeping the place running efficiently. Always attentive to guests requests and all staff are very proficient in conversing in English. The Lounge in the evening can get quite busy and Diamond members are also provided the option of utilising the ""Presidential Suite"" as another quiet option for canapes. Very intimate and one that I really enjoyed. A very good initiative by the hotel!

The breakfast spread at the Marble Lounge maintains a very high standard. The options are endless and you need to pace yourself to be able to enjoy a little bit of everything :) Staff are also very attentive, well spoken in English and no request seem too hard.

Breakfast at the Executive Lounge, although has less variety, is still very enjoyable. Start your day with some freshly squeezed orange juice and don't forget to try the new omelette station. Jun-san will make you one of the best omelette and time permitting, will personally bring it to your table.

This hotel is conveniently located in Shinjuku. A 5min shuttle bus from the hotel to Shinjuku station operates every 20mins. As it was a beautiful crisp sunny weather outside, I preferred a brisk 10mins walk to Shinjuku station. Whether too cold of rainy outside, Nishi-Shinjuku station is only a 5min walk using the underground tunnel; Follow signs to the Marunouchi line (M). 

Across from the hotel is also the Shinjuku Chuo Park. Great for a morning walk and you have the opportunity to visit the Kumano Shrine.

The Concierge desk is always busy and I must highlight the great service and advice provided by Sato-san.

Overall, Great service from Bell desk through to Executive Lounge with special mention of the employees such as Andrea-san, Jun-san and Sato-san making this trip very enjoyable.",5,2017/01/31
1,REDACTED,en,573,"Comfortable stay in a comfortable location, 15 minutes walk to Shinjuku Station but they do provide a free shuttle service that runs every 20 minutes daylight hours. Staff were very friendly but nothing to get excited about. Extremely busy hotel with an apparently famous strawberry buffet that seems to be booked out, hence you get heaps of people who are not in-house guests crowding the lobby. Facilities are mediocre with a less than enticing indoor pool and gym with equipments dating back to the 90s. 

Otherwise it's decent, for the price you pay I'd would have expected more but hey, it's Tokyo and there's just too much to do outside hotel walls ;)",4,2017/01/30
1,REDACTED,en,574,"This hotel was a great place to stay in Tokyo. The rooms were very spacious (especially for Japanese standards), and the bathrooms were extremely nice. The staff was very helpful answering questions and helping at all times. Additionally, the location was very convenient for tourists! 

We stayed on the 24th floor and had a beautiful view of the city from there. We also got a view of Mt Fuji from breakfast in the Executive Lounge which was gorgeous and very special. 

Highly recommend for great service and a nice facility.",5,2017/01/26

When i want to change to the new room with the standing shower bathroom . the staff gave reason that i needed to pay an extra 100 usd /night included breakfast.( which I dont need breakfast at the first place) even though the website show that ""twin deluxe room "" is come with New TOTO Standing shower. and also while in the process of moving to the new room. the Chinese staff treat us like we are Chinese tourist by suspicious us like we are trying to stole something inside the room that belong to the hotel. for Hilton hotel with 4.5 Star this matter shouldn't happen. I feel like staying in the cheap 2 Star hotel.",1,2017/01/24
1,REDACTED,en,577,"As Hilton reward members we were able to obtain a very good rate with a flash sale. Otherwise the nightly rate was expensive. 
We only stayed one night and did not eat at any restaurants. Needless to say I did look at the Strawberry Festival high tea. It looked like Something out of Willie Wonkas. It was a feast for eyes and there were extensive queues.
The location is good with a 7-8 minute walk to the main shopping area of Shinjuku and the Shinjuku station. We arrived from Haneda Airport via the train and used the Narita Express from Shinjuku station to Narita Airport. It was relatively easy. Added to this we used the Hilton free shuttle bus to the station. This was a good service, but this service was very busy and it is best to queue 10 minutes before to ensure your spot and your luggages. Our room was up high and overlooked the front view of the Hilton property which was fairly appealing. The area is fairly quiet despite being close to hustle and bustle. The room was a regular business like room. The bathroom was very good with a double shower. The concierge was excellent and the local map is great for detail. The front desk was friendly and efficient. Do go to Metropolitan government buildings across the road for their two observatories. They are free! We arrived at nine thirty when they opened there was no crowd. The view of Tokyo was spectacular and you really could see what a vast metropolis Tokyo is. Mt Fuji featured! We were lucky with a clear day. We also visited the national gardens Shinjuku gyoen, they were well worth the effort. There is a very good supermarket a couple of minutes away from the Hilton. I would recommend this hotel especially if you can get it at a good rate.
We also stayed in the Tokyo Station area of Tokyo and would probably prefer this area. But nothing is far away with the fantastic trains.",5,2017/01/23
1,REDACTED,en,578,"This is one of the best hotel i have ever stayed. Room was absolutely clean that i could lie on the floor . The most thing i'd love was the view from my room.

The one thing to be mindful of is the location. Even though it is in Shinjuku, it is on the quieter side of Shinjuku and 10 minutes brisk walk to the Shinjuku station. There are metro stations nearby (Tochomae and Nishi-Shinjuku) but like most underground stations in Japan, there are lots of going up and down stairs/escalators/tunnels. Something to be mindful of if you are considering getting to the hotel by public transport with luggage. The hotel do provide a shuttle service to Shinjuku station.",5,2017/01/19

The room was a good size for japan with a very comfortable bed and no noise from outside or other rooms.

the concierge was very helpful at suggesting places to eat in the area as long as you know what you're looking for. 

we didn't have the breakfast as we'd prefer to eat out and being in shinjuku there are so many great places to choose from and that's half the fun.",4,2017/01/19

The rooms were basic and average in size. The shower was the only let down as it's over the bath

The bar and restaurants at the hotel are also excellent (5 star)

Centrally located within walking distance to shopping, trains and attractions

1,REDACTED,en,587,"We have stayed at several hotels in Tokyo over the years, such as the Keio Plaza (which is just down the road from the Hilton), but this is by far the best hotel we have stayed in during our stay in Tokyo. The staff are very helpful, the rooms are clean, modern, quiet and comfortable and the location of the hotel to Shinjuku station is excellent. We booked an executive suite, which included a buffet-style breakfast in the executive lounge. The breakfast is absolutely fantastic and the staff are very attentive. We are coming back for several nights on the way back from a ski-trip to Nagano and we are already looking forward to our stay at the Hilton. We met the Guest Relations Manager out the front of the hotel today, whilst waiting for the complimentary bus to Shinjuku station who was also very friendly and helpful. If you're staying in the Shinjuku area, look no further than the Hilton. We highly recommend it!",5,2017/01/16
1,REDACTED,en,588,"Stayed at the Hotel twice with a group of 9 to Japan, once for three days before heading out to Kyoto and Osaka and then on our last leg for four days. I must say kudos to the staff, I was unable to book rooms on the usual booking sites online, but when I called direct was able to secure rooms both occasions and this is during a busy Christmas and New Year period.
First stay we had refurbished rooms whereas second stay we did not, so ask for the refurbished rooms. The hotel has all the amenities one would expect of a Hilton hotel. A selection of restaurants and the buffet breakfast was quite vast.
Internet access for rooms is not free, surprisingly. If you are a Hilton Honors members, it is free.
Not quite central in Shinjuku, but a brisk walk will get you to the main rail station in about 12-15mins. This is where the hotel direct hotel shuttle bus is a plus, departing every 20mins from hotel to the outside main rail station area. Note, shuttle bus operates only on certain times, so be wary if you need the service early morning or late night.
One annoying thing is no power points near bedside to charge your phone.
There is a local subway station access under hotel.
Not many outside restaurants or shops near hotel, you need to walk to main Shinjuku area for that, which isn't too far anyway.
Another plus why we choose this hotel as well is that the airport limousine bus drops off and picks up form the hotel.",4,2017/01/15
1,REDACTED,en,589,"Since I arrived at the hotel pretty early, I was told that my room was upgraded to the Tower suite but not ready yet, Many thanks to Mr. Hiroaki ; the front desk manager. He is very nice , his english is perfect. 

I actually had my first meal in Tokyo here at the Executive Lounge and I have to say it was absolutely delicious. Although a small continental spread should be expected but the omelettes are close to perfection. Takeaway coffee cups are also available , so feel free to takeaway a cup with you (especially during the winter season!) 

If you are looking for a centrally-located and internationally-branded property to stay in Tokyo, I cannot recommend the Hilton Tokyo enough. It is located to many attractions around the city and if you are going somewhere a little further, the underground pass right outside the doorstep of the hotel will take you to the train station. 

The hotel's location is perfect and while it is definitely not a cheap hotel to stay in, you will definitely appreciate how near everything is - there is also a big FamilyMart about 3 minutes away so it is fairly convenient. 

There is a Presidential lounge for Hilton HHonors Diamond members to enjoy a more private evening cocktail experience - the food and drink selection is pretty much the same as executive lounge though. 

Tips : You can have a breakfast with fuji-san if you stay in at least executive room and have a breakfast at the executive lounge. Come early in the morning, It's amazing ! 

I'm going to stay here again for sure when work or fun lead me to Tokyo again.",5,2017/01/15

We asked to change clean cups, then they brought clean one but it still smells bad so we couldn't enjoy tea.

1,REDACTED,en,595,"This time I selected to ride on airport express to Hilton. 
From Narita express to Tokyo station then exchange to Shinjuku station. Free shuttle bus in front of Keio plaza picked up guests every 20 mins very efficient. 

Alternatively route can get off at Nishi Shinjuku station 5 mins walk from the underground tunnel. Location of the hotel is convenience and easy to get around. For holiday for business purposes go to metro and get a Tokyo pass for 24,36 or 72 hours unlimited ride may be cheaper than suica. 

Reception staff was very friendly, I checked in an executive room on the high floor with nice view.
Tokyo Hilton room size was comparative big and clean.

Executive lounge serving pre-dinner drink with wine, canapé & finger food from 6:00-8:00pm. A bit crowded recommend to go early and leave earlier. 

I loved the buffet breakfast at the restaurant has lots of varieties. I invited my friends to join me there pretty expensive @ ¥3800 per head.

There is the world of the skyscraper when we open those sliding paper doors. The lounge is crowded very much, but is a place healing the fatigue of the trip. The bathtub is wide and is we can see the inside of the room from a bathroom, and interesting made. When the bed lies, it is attacked by drowsiness and is invited to sleep. With a type as we cannot eat the breakfast either, it is coped with poached egg, both sides omelet, every egg cooking including the yolkless fried egg. It is right the oasis in the big city.",5,2017/01/10

We came in early, around 10am, for an early check in. We were greeted by front desk manager who informed us that he will be able to provide us with a early check in and an upgrade to an executive floor as a Gold member.

Room was a twin-bed executive room. Fantastic room compared to other properties in Tokyo. I guess it was recently renovated. We stayed for one night at the Intercontinental ANA and was just a shame.

Executive Lounge is excellent. All day long beer service, amazing cocktail hour with great canapés and service. Breakfast at the lounge is the best breakfast I've had at a Hilton property! The amount of strawberries, raspberries and blueberries was amazing.

I recommend this property much so. I would definitely come back.",5,2017/01/10
1,REDACTED,en,598,"I was there on the 1st and 2nd Jan.
The hotel was packed with Guest and Luggage at the front desk.
Was glad that the staff were able to managed the crowd well.
Nice checkin at front desk and checkout at the lounge. 

There was a note by the GM telling us that if anything is not 10/10, they will make it right.
Sure it is a 10/10 hotel, in all areas, no questions about it.
The lounge was excellent! I just could not find any fault!
The room was nice and spacious. The Bath was excellent, I think they added some Onsen stuffs in the water, so not just pure water!

I asked for a humidifier and they said no more left but later someone knocked at my room and delivered one, with water already inside. 

The concierge was very friendly and able to provide complete answers to all my needs. 

Oh I was lucky to see Mt Fuji from the lounge for both days, sunset was especially great.
The shuttle bus service was very efficient and well managed.

Hilton Tokyo is a Top of the range America Brand hotel in Japan and hence I was not surprised that it exceeded all my expectation !",5,2017/01/09
1,REDACTED,en,599,"Nice property with a very elegant infrastructure. The problem is that the hotel is all the time very crowded (3rd week of December 2016) and this could make the stay unpleasant. I was in the 31st floor and, as there are only 6 lifts for 39floors so the time to get a lift or the time to arrive at the reception/room could be very long as it stops in almost each floor...
Similarly, you have to expect a long queue in the Executive Lounge for the breakfast as well as the evening cocktail..I remember I was requested to go back my room and someone will call me as soon as a table will be available..the problem is, after 30mn no one called me... so 30mn waiting, out of the 2hours of cocktails....
Other than this issue, the personal in the Executive Lounge and concierge was so helpful and very professional and our Room was Great with amazing quality of mattress and pillow..
The breakfast in the executive lounge is also very nice. For restaurants, We tried the Métropolitain Grill in the second floor for Christmas diner, it was fabulous with a very professional team.. Delicious food but very expensive..

To sum-up, The hotel has also all what someone can expects from a 5 star hotel.. overall it was a nice stay..

Buy a limo bus ticket at the airport terminal and the bus will bring you to the hotel. Cost about USD12.",5,2017/01/09
1,REDACTED,en,601,"Fantastic customer service, other Hilton's should learn from this outfit. Stayed here twice on 2 seperate legs of our journey. Had 2 issues with our second reservation which was really not the fault of the hotel but Guest Relations Manager Yoshihisa Tamura was beyond helpful and professional with helping us initially. On the back end, Guest Relations Manager Ernesto Bressan was just as helpful and professional in getting us to an proper room. So you know, only certain King rooms are large enough to accomodate a rollaway. My assumption that a more expensive, higher level Executive King room would also accomodate a rollaway when a lower level King room was able to do so was the root cause of some issues, in conjunction with the fact that they ran out of rollaways irrespective. As a Hilton Honors Gold member I was treated to breakfast for the the family (2 adults and 2 teens) and no charge for the first rollaway. A helpful point, to get Elite benefits any longer you must book your reservation directly via Hilton or a higher end travel agent, you will not get them if you book through the online discounters (expedia, priceline,etc); ie, booking via the discounters, whose pricing was the same but only with a longer cancellation window, would have cost me in real dollars an extra $200 nightly between breakfast and the rollaway. Gym was nice, tried the Japanese bath once (fyi, at the bath a sign says that wearing a bath suit in the bath is not considered appropriate). executive club was nice, they are strict on the dress code however; we showed up in flip flops in the am just to have coffee and were asked to wear shoes and no gym type clothes (wear wearing shorts and a t-shirt). ironically, we ended up in 2 junior executive suite rooms during the 2 stays, the first room on the 25th floor was much more modern and updated than the same room type on the 35th floor; irrespective, both were identical in layout and very spacious. lastly, the hilton booking engine did not allow you to put more than 2 adults, 1 child in a king, I called the hotel via skype and the front office clerk told me that she would add the 4th person (but call and make sure that the room you are booking can accomodate this, as above).",5,2017/01/08
1,REDACTED,en,602,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. We found the staff helpful and welcoming and the shuttle to and from the station very handy. The food buffets were great and our daughter loved the dessert buffet. It was a memorable part of our stay. The room was comfortable and clean and the blockout blinds ensured we could sleep in when we chose to. The level 2 cocktail bar was also very relaxing with great live music and cocktails. Tip: make sure you book the dinner buffet and seats on the airport bus as both can book out. You can usually get a late table for the buffet if you wait though. Thanks Hilton, this was one of the most enjoyable hotel stays we have had.",5,2017/01/08
1,REDACTED,en,603,"Third time staying at Hilton Tokyo and never lets me down.

Rooms are spacious and beds are good.
I just love the views from the hotel.
Stayed on the executive floor.

Customer service especially at the executive lounge is excellent. Fluent English speaking staff, who do everything to make you feel welcome and pleased.
I was little disappointed to noticed that they had stopped the HHonors breakfast at the second floor. But then noticed that the same chef had moved to executive lounge and the breakfast was improved at the lounge. Breakfast downstairs can be really crowded so I enjoyed the breakfast at the executive lounge. Great choice, cause the staff makes it an excellent experience and especially at the winter time there is a great chance for you to see good glimpse of the mt. Fuji too.

Hotel has an access to marunouchi and oedo lines. Free shuttle bus takes you back and forth to Shinjuku station every twenty minutes, but you can easily walk there in just 10-15mins.

Will definitely stay here again next time in Tokyo.",5,2017/01/07
1,REDACTED,en,604,"We were here from 21st to 26th December and had a wonderful stay.
On arrival , we had a smooth & quick check-in , and were taken to our rooms on the 30th floor by a very courteous porter. As requested earlier , we were given rooms with fabulous views of Mt. Fuji. Both the rooms were good , and we couldn't spot any major flaw.
The breakfast at the Marble Lounge was satisfactory , and since we had to take an early morning Shinkansen on most of the days , we could avail the 'limited spread' breakfast there from 5 - 6:30 AM.
The concierge staff was very helpful , escorting us to our car / taxi even at 5 in the morning , and giving precise directions / instructions to the driver so that we did not waste any time on our way.
Would love to return here again !!",4,2017/01/07
1,REDACTED,en,605,"Hilton Tokyo is definitely an old Hotel with a history of 50+ years. Even though its renovated, their rooms are not comparable with Hilton Osaka. Lets take an example of their Standard & Deluxe Room, the bath tub were Yellowish and smells. The first stay with Hilton Tokyo, I wasn't upgraded despite being a Diamond Member. 

The second stay which I came back after 2 days in Mount Fuji and Hakone, I was upgraded to Executive Room using 2 Diamond Members Card. The Executive Room are much more stylish and well maintained meaning cleanliness, view, high floor, service etc. The room is big enough & better than Expected Japan's Standard. 

Service is superb as after a long walk outside, my leg was bleeding because of the Nike Shoes when requested, they patiently asked about it and took plasters from the First Aid Box. Service at the Breakfast area and Executive Lounge was better than the Check-in Counter. 

The downside is being some parts of the hotels are rundown and the check-in counter is alwayd crowded. You gotta be a diamond member to check-in at the executive lounge. 

Overall, I felt that Hilton Tokyo is worth the stay if you are booking for a better room. I would definitely come back again to try their suites.",4,2017/01/06
1,REDACTED,en,606,"Loved this hotel, the staff and its location. What I have come to expect from Hilton hotels outside of the US. Withing walking distance of some great restaurants.

1,REDACTED,en,607,"Shinjuku Hilton staff was excellent. They were very helpful and accomadated our needs well. They were very courteous and friendly. Rooms were very comfortable.

1,REDACTED,en,608,"We stayed for 2 nights over New Year with my family. The hotel was so crowded. Although we arrived at 7 pm, we waited for quite awhile to check into our room. Upon booking we have requested for extra bed for our teen for the 2 nights, without informing us, the staff managed to arrange for 1 night. (this is disappointed)
During breakfast, the buffet table was so crowded and messy, & the hotel staffs were so lost. We have nothing to say, as the hotel was running full during this peak season.
The hotel arranged for new year countdown with live band, which we enjoy very much.
Overall we are quite happy.

1,REDACTED,en,609,"The staff of the Tokyo Hilton are attentive, prompt and efficient. Although there was a line at Reception most of the time, they usually had a manager addressing those waiting to triage their requests and direct them to the proper personnel if he/she was unable to handle the request directly, thereby minimizing wait time for all.

I stayed in an Executive King room... It was a good size with adequate storage for one person, but two people sharing the space may find closet and bathroom space somewhat limited. The lounge chair in the room was particularly comfortable... Great for reading or catching up on email. All standard amenities were present and in good working order... For those who always want to look their best, the iron and ironing board were of particularly good quality (much better than what you generally find in western hotel rooms). The only downside to the room was the shower/tub combo in the bathroom... The bathroom is a bit small to begin with and having just the shower would likely have been a better use of the available space. That said, the shower itself was quite good, fully stocked with all necessary grooming products.

One of the best things about the Tokyo Hilton is the Executive Lounge... Not only does it provide Executive room guests a full selection of breakfast offerings (both western and standard Japanese breakfast cuisine) and cocktails, it offers a beautiful view of Mount Fuji, especially in the morning.

Getting around to and from the hotel is very easy: The hotel's location in Nishi Shinjuku is very good and their shuttle bus to/from the Shinjuku Station was consistently on-time. There is also direct access from the hotel lobby to a pedestrian tunnel linking the hotel to two different Tokyo Metro stations (serving two different lines) for easy access to the rest of the metropolitan area and connections to national transit systems.",4,2017/01/04
1,REDACTED,en,610,"We love this hotel and the service it provides. Absolutely top notch, and they'll make it right if it's not! The hotel provides a shuttle to the Shinjuku station and the metro can be accessed below the hotel.",5,2017/01/03
1,REDACTED,en,611,"We stayed for 3 nights over Christmas with my 2 young children and really enjoyed our stay here.

First, the staff were very helpful. We arrived early at 7 am, and the room wasn't ready despite my request for early check-in. This is understandable, since the hotel was fully booked. Our receptionist offered access to the Executive Lounge and gym shower facilities so we could freshen up. At the lounge, seeing how exhausted my kids were from the long flight, they gave us a table with a long sofa so that they could lie down.

When we finally got the room, we were delighted with how spacious the room was. The view was fantastic, location is great, breakfast spread excellent. We had our Christmas eve dinner at the in-house Junisoh - we were greedy and ordered both sushi and teppanyaki, both were really good. Can't ask for more for this stay.",5,2017/01/02
1,REDACTED,en,612,We arrived at the hotel to be greeted by lovely staff and were briskly checked in. We were escorted to our suite before being given our bags. Then we headed for the pool and went for a quick swim. The pool is not huge but it never gets too busy so the size is adequate. The rooftop tennis court is absolutely amazing-you can play a game of tennis whilst overlooking one of the biggest cities in the world!,5,2017/01/02

1,REDACTED,en,615,"We stayed for 4 nights over Christmas. Had a Jr Suite for my family of 4. I don't think a comparable hotel in Shinjuku can accommodate 4 people spaciously in one room. Hotel service was very good including the Executive Lounge. Location is excellent near Shinjuku Station (hotel provides a free shuttle) and 5 minute walks to 2 different stations and subway lines. My only cons for the place:

1) Because of our plane departure. we needed a room till 900 pm. The hotel charged us full rate. Not classy.
2) Design wise, the Hilton is not in the same league as the Park Hyatt etc.",5,2016/12/31
1,REDACTED,en,616,"Booked a junior suite on member special deal. Compared to other hotel, it was deal, about 33,000 yens. I am a gold HHonor member. No further upgrade since I already reserved a junior suite with the executive lounge access.
Check-in at the executive lounge took some time because we arrive at the hotel around noon. Waited about an hour for our room to get ready.
They had assigned me a junior suite on 9th floor.
When we got off the elevator on 9th floor, the whole corridor was filled with the smell of cooking foods! Not a pleasant experience. However, this was taken care of later. No strong smell during our stay after the check in day.
The room was spacious enough considering it's Tokyo. Bathroom was equipped with a deep bath tub and and shower head at the same room. Bathroom amenities were quite nice, all in a bigger bottles!
The hotel is located in Shinjuku area, and the hotel is connected to the subway underground although it's a long walk!
From the Haneda airport, we took the airport limousine, the bus stopped and drop us off at the hotel front doorsteps! Very convinient! The return airport limousine also pick us up at the hotel!
The executive lounge was well equipped and well serviced. All the staffs were courteous and more than happy to provide the services and to answer all the questions! The lobby coffee shop for the breakfast was more than adequate with abundant choice of both Asian, Japanese and Western foods.
The concierge was also good. We asked for a good Kaiseki restaurant in Tokyo on a short notice, but they got us into a nice Kaiseki restaurant in Shibuya area. I also asked a pet shop to purchase gifts for my dog, and they found me a nice pet shop!
Late check out was requested and granted up to 2 PM.

1,REDACTED,en,618,"We stay here for 1 night to close up our holiday before we went back, hoping for a great night in a 5 stars hotel.

But I had an accident by felling down in bathtub while taking shower. There is no manager on duty that worried about the accident and there is no one here that offering me first aid. After waiting for so long and few phone calls they only offered me room change to make my stay more enjoyable but no concern about my injury and keep asking me what I want without providing me with solution or options on how to treat my injury. Later on I keep saying and coming to the lobby then they offer us some medicine. Can anyone still enjoy a better room when they have injury and the body feel pain?

One of the manager mentioned to me that there is no first aid department in the hotel and they can only offer us to go to hospital. And he said that they follow the international standard. But I can't go as I have to catch a flight to go back to my country. After while I ended up have to go to hospital at my country and pay for everything by myself. Somehow I feel I am lucky as my back and arm not that serious. Hilton later on responded to us that they had check with the engineering that the bathtub is up to the Japanese standard and it's safe despite the fact I am actually fell down over there. There is nothing I can say to them anymore but only feel disappointed. All I can say in here is just a friendly reminding to everyone that please be careful when you guys staying with them.

1,REDACTED,en,621,"Being a Hilton, it's a huge hotel, especially so since it's the flagship in Tokyo. But it goes well and doesn't feel impersonal, even though the lobby can look as busy as a train station. The concierge was very helpful in giving us directions to places, and they also gave us tips on navigating the Metro system, like which was the most convenient station to change lines, so that it was just a simple walk across the platform, instead of having to walk many steps to hunt for the right line.

There was also direct access from the hotel basement to both the Maronouchi and Oedo lines via the Hiltopia shopping arcade. It's a little too far to walk to Shinjuku station, but the hotel has a 43-seat shuttle bus, which runs every 20 min from 8 am to 10 pm. The shuttle stop at Shinjuku is on the west side of the station, bus stop #21 in front of Keio dept store.

The rooms were nice and comfortable, with a spacious writing / working table. In built power adaptors were useful, and the water pressure from the shower was strong.

The service I was given from the check in to the check out was way above and beyond. The friendly staff went out of their way to ensure I had an exceptional stay. I absolutely loved my gorgeous King Room and I would marry the stunningly beautiful view I had from my window in my room on the 33rd Floor, it was absolutely breathtaking!! I was warm and comfortable and most of all as I was travelling solo felt very safe and secure at all times! The breakfast was delicious and satisfying. The location was perfect and the complimentary shuttle to the Shinjuku Station was a godsend. I was thrilled I would be celebrating my birthday whilst staying at the Shinjuku Hilton and the lovely girls from the yummy chocolate shop in the lobby surprised me by decorating my piece of delicious chocolate cake with a personalised birthday greeting, now that was a lovely gesture I will never ever forget.

My clothes have never looked better. The hotel views are stunning. My mother's room had a view of Mt Fuji, which was delightful. The main breakfast spread was delicious and well kept. We had JR passes and the shinjuku line was convenient to use our passes to tour the city.

The suite has a very spacious living and sleep area. The shower and vanity area on the other hand rather small for the room of this size. The suite over all was very clean, well maintained, and beautifully decorated with Japanese styling and sensibility. I used the Executive Lounge twice during my stay and was happy with the offerings and services there. The location is very convenient as a stop on Manuruochi line is just outside on the left.

The hotel is situated whiting a business quarter, which means that it takes a long 10 minute walk to get to some crowded area.

For tourists, I would recommend booking hotels which are closer to any of the main stations, around which there are plenty of things to do.

Room:
The room was very nice: relatively big, nice view and equipped with a great shower

Lobby:
While the lobby is modern and nice, there are hardly places to sit down and relax other than the main restaurant (with exaggerated prices)

1,REDACTED,en,629,"I'll be contacting Hilton Worldwide about my awful experience at the Hilton Tokyo. 

It all started with the check in process in the mad-house lobby, the Japanese receptionist could have been more friendly and courteous. She rejected any room upgrades with my Gold status and also was very adamant that we don't stay in our (PAID) room between the hours of ""12pm and 5pm"" the next day due to a ""bed change"". 

To top it all off the room was not ready as I awoke up freezing at 1am and the heat was not turned on, nor could I get the room controls to work. When I contacted housekeeping they then finally turned on the heat for the room remotely and this was after they wanted to come into the room at 1am! 

The night manager tried to make amends the NEXT day by switching us to a slightly bigger suite than what we booked but the damage was already done. We all got sick from the freezing conditions. We thought the Hilton brand would be consistent especially after I had already paid for and booked an executive jr suite for added comfort. 

There's many more options than this and with the money we spent we could of stayed at the Park Hyatt instead.

Pros: bigger room if you are willing to pay for it. Executive lounge for beverages and light snacks. Breakfast in lobby is decent. Shinjuku has a lot of places to see. 

Cons: reception service is awful. Gold status means nothing. Lots of people in lobby at all times. Lack of proper customer service. Room conditions may not ready or adequate for what you pay for.",2,2016/12/17

1,REDACTED,en,637,"We have just returned from a 10 day trip to Japan. We ended it with three nights in Tokyo. I spent a lot of time trying to decide where we would stay for those nights. I had reservations at three hotels - the other two were the Mandarin and the Park Hyatt. In the end, we ended up at the Hilton because I felt it allowed us to stay in a very nice hotel in a good location in Tokyo and still leave us money we would have spent on a room at the other two places for dining and sightseeing.

Rooms are nice sized, esp for Tokyo. Nice bathroom with great water pressure. We were on 24 floor and had city view which was enhanced by overlooking a beautiful park whose leaves had turned so many beautiful colors. 

We had access to the executive lounge which is very large and on two sides of the building. On two of the mornings we were able to see Mt Fuji which was great. Loved the access to adult beverages in the evenings. Thought food in mornings for breakfast was significantly better that the appetizers offered in evening. 

There are three restaurants on the mezzanine level above the lobby. One is Chinese, another is Japanese, and the third is like an American steak house with Fire Grill. We chose that option as we had been given a 30% off coupon upon arrival. We were very tired and hungry and order the three different steaks with a couple of side dishes. We also had a couple of glasses of wine each. The meal was fabulous. It also was pretty expensive. After the coupon was applied the meal still exceeded $200 USD. 

Saying that, I think have to factor in that finer dining in Tokyo is expensive nearly anywhere you go.

The hotel offers a shuttle every 20 minutes to the Shinjuku train station. We only did this once and I wish we had done it all least one more time. It's very convenient and that's such a crazy part of Tokyo to experience. 

Paid for the upgraded internet. Worked great and it's fast so I thought it's worth the cost.

We flew back from Haneda and there is an expresss bus that picks you up at the hotel. It's a great purchase at $12 a ticket. 

On our next trip the only reason i might consider staying elsewhere would only be due to choosing to stay in more of a downtown setting near the Imperial Palace and Tokyo Station. 

Finally, I didn't notice until our final day that there are bikes in front of the hotel that are available to guests. There is a beautiful park adjacent to the hotel that would be a great place to ride.",4,2016/12/05

I like the location in Shinjuku and that you can access the subway line directly from the hotel.

The rooms are updated and clean. Slept well. Internet available at extra charge unless you are an HHonors member. There are adequate electrical outlets to charge your phone and other gadgets.

Mini fridge stocked with beverages and snacks with an itemized price list which you fill in and turn in when you check out. That leaves no space for your own snacks that need refrigeration. You can always toss out some of their stuff temporarily. Ice bucket in closet but I never found the ice machine. 

Electric kettle available to make coffee or tea. The coffee is instant which I refrain from. Liquid creamer in the fridge and I looked hard to make sure it wasn't on the price list.

Restaurants and bars occupy 2nd floor in a walk through concept; no walls between them which make a specific restaurant difficult to identify or locate.

Convenience store and shops located in the basement. 

Shuttle bus service to Shinjuku station available hourly. If you miss the bus, you can take a 5-8 min walk 4 blocks away or take a cab and experience the driver mutter expletives in Japanese. The trip is too short and they have to come back and join the back of the queue.

Limousine Bus picks up and drops off passengers to/from Narita & Haneda airports. You are advised to make advance bookings for the bus service as they can be full when reservations are made by passengers from other pick up locations.

This is very helpful as the lounge gets full, however not so great if you need a certain type of table or a power plug though the staff tried to accommodate those requests. We were on the 37th floor which was great, except when taking the elevator down. The hotel was so extremely crowded that most times, we stopped at every floor on the way down. The fitness center was nice and had the equipment we needed. The hotel advertises tennis courts, but charges $50 an hour to play. The room service menu was very high-priced as well. ($40 for a burger.) We did find a better selection for breakfast in the lobby restaurant, which was also included as Diamond members. The lobby always seemed to be packed and crowded. Not a bad thing, just an observation. The hotel also provides free shuttle service to/from Shinjuku station which was nice and they offer transport to Haneda airport for about $12USD each and Narita for about $35 each.",4,2016/12/04
1,REDACTED,en,642,"My family and I were staying here when the earthquake hit on Nov. 22. We were on the 32rd floor, so it was pretty scary to experience an earthquake from that height. I must commend the entire staff at the Hilton for their sense of calm and grace under pressure. 

After the quake, the elevators were shut down and we didn't want to walk down 32 flights of stairs, so we stayed put. The staff came on the loudspeaker to assure everyone that there had been an earthquake but that the hotel was safe. They made an announcement again after the hotel had been checked and the elevator service restored.

During that time, my husband and son went to the Executive Lounge to see if there was anything to drink and were astonished to find a staff member emerging from the stairwell. He had climbed 32 floors to bring up a tray of bread to the Executive Lounge to make sure guests had access to food & drink. Amazing!

A few hours later we went to the buffet breakfast and it was as if nothing had happened. I guess the show must go on - in spite of an earthquake.

Setting aside this incident, this is my favorite hotel in Tokyo (and also my second stay here). The location is perfect - very close to Shinjuku station, the family rooms are nice & large, the breakfast is outstanding, the gym and pool are outstanding (plus they have tennis courts) and the staff superlative. What more can I say?

Highly recommend a stay here if visiting the Tokyo area. Thanks Hilton for another stellar experience.",5,2016/12/04
1,REDACTED,en,643,"My partner and I stayed at the Hilton Tokyo for six nights as part of our vacation in Japan. We had an excellent experience at the hotel. First, the hotel staff went out of their way to accommodate us: we had booked with Hilton directly, a twin room executive suite special rate. When we arrived at the hotel, we asked for a king room, which they gladly provided the next day when it became available. This was really a terrific gesture. The hotel rooms are very comfortable and modern (the water pressure in the shower was also terrific), and very quiet. The hotel staff could not have been more helpful. All of them, the check-in staff, the concierge, the doormen, the bell station, the wait staff on the executive level dining room, could not have been more delightfully helpful. The hotel is located in Shinjuku and has direct access to the Nishi-Shinjuku metro station, so it's easy to get anywhere in the city. The hotel WIFI worked perfectly throughout. I would absolutely recommend the Hilton Tokyo for anyone traveling to Tokyo and looking for a great hotel at a good price and we would absolutely stay here again.",5,2016/12/04

1,REDACTED,en,650,"The visit in hilton started perfectly, we got an upgrade and chocolates as it was our anniversary. We chose hilton as one of the several hotels during our visit and it was our first hilton. I was hoping the level of service would be better but the staff seem to suffer from attitude issues. One day we were dressed up casually as we were going for a hike and we had a coffee in the lobby. The staff tried extra hard to humiliate us, trying to find a spot where we would not be seen and we ended up sitting on some ripped chairs away from everyone. Why do you even have ripped furniture in the central hilton?! Regardless I never experienced such terrible customer service in my life and I honestly don't care about the hotels image. You should care about the customers pleasure but I sadly realised it's just a pretentious place that we will not be visiting in the future. No value for money, most hotels around the world and of course in Tokyo offer at least some free water but you need to be a silver member in hilton to have the honour! It's a shame as I expected more but it's OK, we will not spend our hard earned money on such an establishment in the future. Avoid like the plague",2,2016/11/29

My wife and I stayed at a Ritz Carlton right before this in Seoul, S. Korea, and this Hilton was better all the way around. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because the bathrooms need to be updated, aside from that the place was great!!

1,REDACTED,en,652,"This is my repeat visit to a outstanding hotel. It's close by to the Shinjuku metro and has lots of eating places in close proximity. My checking in was a breeze as ""they had a room with my name on it""

The hotel room is modern and well appointed. They had renovated the rooms from before and now have a more modern style bathroom than many years before. As I was upgraded to the executive floor, the view outside was fantastic. The night view was even better. 

The executive lounge on the 37 floor is a welcome oasis after a work day and you get breakfast , afternoon tea and evening happy hour service. Their service is impeccable as always. 

The lobby cafe is a good choice location to have a coffee, drink or meal. There is a counter selling premium chocolates for that perfect gift too

I remembered dining at the metropolitan grill at level 2 on a trip previously and they serve fantastic steaks with good choice of wine to accompany the meal. 

Hilton Tokyo is simply my home away from home as usual.",5,2016/11/29

1,REDACTED,en,656,"Frequented this hotel for years when doing business in Japan in the Shinjuku area. Excellent and predictable to a fault. Not as many tourists due to location away from the Imperial Palace and Ginza (but reachable by subway/train quickly), but that is very OK with us. More western business people, excellent restaurants (and breakfast to die for), wonderful upper levels for Hilton club members to gain drinks and small breakfast in quiet location.
Staff is extraordinary as you would expect. Location to Shinjuku station by walking five to ten minutes connects you to trains and subways in whole city and beyond. If using that station during rush hour, best to allow plenty of time, be patient, read signs carefully, and you'll do great. Otherwise go midday or in evening to get lay of land and scope out best way to use the wonderful transport system.
Terrific transport by car, limo, train to either Narita or Haneda; just need to talk to your travel agent or the hotel. BTW, easiest and cheapest way for transport from two airport to Hilton is with the busses that leave often....particularly for first timers in Japan.
Relax and enjoy; the Hilton will be your home away from home!",5,2016/11/28

This was the last legnof our trip so we decided to stay and chill in the hotel. The hotel offers shuttle bus to Shinjuku station and back. We used the airport limosine service to narita for $31 each to save time and energy . But there is an option to go to Shjnjuku station and transfer to Narita Express that is included on JR rail pass. The wait time to check-in at 3 PM was not too long. we were accommodated right away and concierge sent out luggage to the room immediately. It is spacious and clean, unlike tytpical japanese hotel rooms. The hotel has bar and japanese restaurant Junisoh which may be overpriced but food was good. We had buffet brakfast in the morning for $39/ person with options like American, Chinese and Japanese food. which is good. It was busy at around 7Am. but wevstarted earlier.",5,2016/11/26
1,REDACTED,en,660,"Stayed at hilton hotel made me feel like home. All the staff members from the shuttle bus driver, the first staff member we met was very friendly and helpful to manage our luggage. Hilton Tokyo provides a free shuttle that locates in front of Keio departement store. It leaves every 20 minutes. It made my trip with my husband very easy especially in the cold weather. It didn't take long time for cek in although it wash crowded and less than 5 minutes for cek out. They prepared my special request of pillow. We stayed at 16th floor with a great view of street. This is a flawless hotel during our 2 nights stay in Tokyo. I do recommend this hotel for your stay in Tokyo.",5,2016/11/26
1,REDACTED,en,661,"This is our second time here and we now go out of our way to stay here. Great location and always a bustling hive of activity. 

We stayed in an executive standard king room this time (we got an upgrade to a tower suite the last time which was very lucky). And even though this is obviously smaller than the suite it is roomy enough for two and very comfortable. The bathrooms are smaller than average but that's a Japanese thing and is not a criticism. The combination wet room/deep bath is quirky and the hot water runs long and soothingly.

But by far the best thing about this hotel is that for Diamond members you get access to the sumptuous breakfast buffet in the lobby - tip, come early if you can because the queues can be massive - and you also get access to a very secret other benefit which I won't ruin here. Suffice to say it's something I've not come across at any other Hilton yet.

Love this place and will most definitely be back.",5,2016/11/23
1,REDACTED,en,662,"I went here in March 2014 with my father. 
The room was beautiful as was the bathroom. The beds were great and the breakfast was always a treat! 

The location of the hotel is perfect as it is near an underground. 

The staff was very friendly (all of them from cleaning staff to reception and restaurants). 

Travelling to Japan was a once in a life tine experience and i am happy to have spent it in this hotel.

1,REDACTED,en,663,"For our first trip to Tokyo, we did a lot of research and ended up picking the Hilton in Shinjuku given the recommendations of friends, and the over 'look and feel' of the place. We arrived much too early for our check in time (about 6:30am), but the staff were very, very friendly, and allowed us to access the Executive Lounge (we'd booked a Executive Junior Suite King room). Upon accessing the Lounge, we were sat down, and asked if we'd like a view of Mt. Fuji, at which point the screens were opened and there he was in all his glory! What a fabulous start to the holiday!

As I said, we stayed in a Executive Junior Suite King room (Room 2425) which was great. There was a nice big couch (which allowed both of us to lie on it and watch TV) and a view over Shinjuku. There's only one of these rooms on each floor (looking at the floor plan on the back of the door) and it's right next to the lift lobby - but honestly - we didn't hear a thing the whole time we were there.

The bedding was fantastic, and the air conditioning very cool. The yukata's were comfortable, and the bathroom was good. Our only gripe would be that the bathroom was very very small, and the arrangement of the shower door meant that we actually had to step out into the room while we were wet to close the door behind us and then go back into the bathroom to towel off. Not a big deal.

The Executive Lounge was lovely, and the staff very, very accommodating. We had the option of breakfast either in the Lounge or in the main Lobby Restaurant (which was interesting, because often at Hilton's it's ""one or the other""). I was initially concerned about there being a possible 'lesser' breakfast in the Lounge, but in all honesty, other than pancakes and French Toast, the offerings were pretty similar. The main restaurant was large and hectic, and of our six breakfasts, we ended up only having one down there.

The location was good. We quickly got into the knack of catching the free shuttle to and from Shinjuku Station and the wait was never a bother. Only once did it look like the bus would be full, but we squeezed on anyway. 

The staff was great, from helping us post postcards (old school!), making and confirming dinner reservations and even organizing the shipping of our luggage on to Kyoto they couldn't have been more accommodating - and language was never a barrier (if you talked clearly, slowly and not hysterically like some people next to us one morning!)

We were only there for 5 nights, and in reality I couldn't suggest if it's the best location or not to stay in in Tokyo - but I'd certainly recommend it for anyone who wanted to stay in Tokyo.",5,2016/11/21
1,REDACTED,en,664,"Stayed at this hotel for our whisky and foodie holiday trip.
First the good : the service is good and they do run a shuttle to the Shinjuku fro where you can start your foodie and shopping trips...but honestly it's a bit off The Central whisky and good joints.
We stayed at the club floor but oftentimes the club level was very full and thus breakfast became a chore...maybe we were there during the busy period.
All things being equal, it was a good Hilton experience.",4,2016/11/20

I am a diamond member with close to 200 nights at Hilton's this year and this was very disappointing. The room was tiny, the upgrade was noticeable and the lounge snacks pretty scarce. Here on points, not what you would expect from 30nights worth of hotel stays. Great service from Lounge reception.",3,2016/11/15
1,REDACTED,en,671,"I am positively impressed by this property that must have been re-modeled in recent times.
PROs: fine furnitures and fabrics in the room; great gym; superb breakfast buffet, for selection and environment (there can be long cues after /.30am circa); very nice mezzanine floor with several small restaurants in a modern design atmosphere; great services; tennis courts.
CONSs: regular rooms are tokyo-sized; the lobby is not a large, spacy one, as they priviledged the seating area for the lobby restaurant. It can get crowdy and make you feel in a small hotel.
CONCLUSION: for a rate of circa 300USD/night you may expect larger rooms, larger and magnificent lobby. Beside that, the hotel sully delivers a 5 stars value with a touch of very fine modern design. It's a very good choice for Shinjuku -at walking distance from the Park Hyatt's New York Bar, if you fancy ""Lost in Translation"".",4,2016/11/14
1,REDACTED,en,672,"Nice hotel with very helpful staff. Executive lounge is great & there is the excellent breakfast on the first floor.

The lighting is awful and the room in very dated and tired looking with dark wood panelling in the bedroom and lounge. There's also only two plug sockets, one in the bathroom and one by the desk which is irritating. You have to boil the kettle on the floor! The bathroom is very small and the shower is an in bath type not separate walk in which I read others had. I can only assume the rooms in the photos have been upgraded but 3221 hasn't. The executive club room gets very crowded and unless you get there at 6pm on the dot you end up squashed on a tiny table with extremely close neighbours.

There was breakfast in the morning with lots of choice including specialty coffees. You could use the lounge any time during the day and get hot or cold drinks including alcoholic beverages. There was a cocktail hour which canapes and alcoholic beverages. Staff was outstanding. The Japanese are a very kind, helpful and gracious people and it showed everywhere. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2016/11/10

There are the free government viewing towers, the main Shinjuku train station and Shinjuku park within walking distance as well as a variety of shops and restaurants near Shinjuku station. The hotel it self links to a ""Hiltopia"" mall that has some shops and restaurants (Indian, Italian, Japanese) if you don't want to venture too far out but don't want to eat in the hotel either.

The hotel is also one of the stops on the airport shuttle bus ""limousine"" service if you want to avoid expensive taxis - but be aware that this can take up to two hours from Narita airport!

In terms of the hotel, its fairly modern - with a large lobby area - if rather dark.

The rooms and bathroom are small if well appointed. I guess for the amount of money i paid, i was expecting a lot more - even accounting for the fact that i expect Tokyo to be expensive.

I didn't really use any of the facilities - though believe they have a gym. The breakfast was a good spread of a decent quality.

That said the staff, especially the concierge team are very friendly and most employees on the desks speak good English.

1,REDACTED,en,680,"I was doubtful about booking the Jr Executive King Suite but we got a good price. Came to find out that it was well worth the price as you get access to the executive lounge (i.e. access to EXCELLENT breakfast buffet, afternoon tea snacks and night snacks and unlimited drinks). We ended up spending so much time at the breakfast buffet that we started couple of our days late. Room is very big for Tokyo standard. We also used their business center to print Disney tickets for free. 

We used the JR pass so we always go to JR Shinjuku station although the closest subway station is actually Nishi-shinjuku station or the Tochomae station (both non-JR stations). JR Shinjuku station is a very large and confusing station with a bunch of exits. If you exit the wrong one, it may take you a long route to get to the right place again. We took advantage of the free hotel shuttle (in front of the Keio department store) which comes every 20 mins between hotel and Shinjuku station. Definitely helps save some walking after a long day. 

Tokyo was our first stop and then we were heading to Hakone for one night then Kyoto. Hilton offered takkyubin (luggage delivery) service at the lobby so we simply shipped our two big luggages from Hilton straight to our Kyoto hotel so we didn't have to drag the luggages on Shinkansen. Hilton filled out all the paper work for us and it was hassle free. For two big luggages, takkyubin fee was about 3400 yen.

1,REDACTED,en,682,"Terrific service in every aspect! Super comfortable rooms and beds - we had a 1 bedroom executive suite. Even the additional rollaway bed we needed was a comfortable, real twin mattress rather than just a cot. My kids loved the bathroom with the heated toilet seat and bidet, it was a whole new concept to them and a very nice luxury. The bathtub was super deep and the shower next to it was very nice. We had breakfast vouchers and the food was great. But for other meals, it was too pricey to eat at the hotel and there are plenty of other options around. The location is excellent, with a station right under the hotel and the Shinjuku station was fairly close by, with a hotel shuttle provided to the station. My only complaint on that aspect is that the shuttle doesn't run 24/7, so by the time we got to Shinjuku from the airport with an international flight, it was too late and the shuttle wasn't running anymore. It's a far enough walk with luggage and kids that we ended up having to take a cab. Overall we had a great experience there and I would definitely stay there again.",5,2016/11/09

It was a special trip and the Hilton Tokyo team made the whole experience enjoyable. I cant wait to return to Tokyo the Hilton Tokyo would always be my first choice.,5,2016/11/07
1,REDACTED,en,690,"The hotel is very central and very up to date, I would definitely recommend this hotel for business travelers and those on vacation.

The free shuttle bus to the train station is also an additional benefit as it aids in getting around the city with ease.",5,2016/11/06
1,REDACTED,en,691,"We were traveling with some friends and booked a last minute room for one night only. 
Our vacation felt like a bit of a whirlwind, but as soon as we stepped in to this luxurious hotel we felt at peace. 
Rooms were great
Breakfast amazing 
Airport transfur flawless.",5,2016/11/06
1,REDACTED,en,692,"Our room had a terrific view and was well appointed. The location was just across the street from a metro station, and close to another that could be easily accessed from the shopping mall in the basement. The executive lounge served an excellent breakfast with a view of Mt. Fuji. Drinks and snacks in the evening were equally inviting. There is a shuttle to Shinjuku station and the airport shuttle stops there also. We also discovered we could purchase our metro tickets from the concierge in the lobby and charge them to our room.",5,2016/11/06
1,REDACTED,en,693,Breakfast was the best part of the hotel with huge buffet choices and lots of seating. Western and Asian choices aplenty. Service was superb always from front desk to concierge to bar. Clean and quiet. Elevators a bit slow. Numerous restaurants on site or within a block...including Dennys and Starbucks. Disappointing that the only English language TV stations were CNN and BBC. Hot water in shower was superb.,4,2016/11/05
1,REDACTED,en,694,We were worn out after a long flight and 2 hour bus ride from the airport. The hotel is beautiful. We were tired and hungry and wished we had known there was a 24 hour convenience store in the basement shopping area connected to the hotel. We shared a room service order and called it a night. The room was comfy with nice storage. We will probably never return to Japan but can highly recommend this hotel.,5,2016/11/05
1,REDACTED,en,695,Excellent base for a short city break in Tokyo. Curtesy bus to local Shinjuku Station was a bonus. From here you are able to explore the city with ease. The hotel location within the business district also means its in a peaceful location with no ongoing night noise.,5,2016/11/05
1,REDACTED,en,696,I really enjoyed the executive lounge. The ability for you to go in and grab some snacks really helps make your stay more enjoyable. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Shinjuku station and they do provide a complimentary shuttle service 3 times an hour. The airport shuttle also stops at the front entrance too.,5,2016/11/05
1,REDACTED,en,697,"shin juke is one of the best locations in Tokyo to stay at. Ther are many great places to eat at for reasonable prices. Access to multiple public transport ion systems,
Is excellent. It has been my favorite hotel in Tokyo for over 20 years.",5,2016/11/03
1,REDACTED,en,698,"I am very happy with my stay in Hilton hotel, Tokyo. The free shuttle bus is convinence and the staff members are helpful. The only thing I would complain is that the cleaner didn't clean the room completely.",4,2016/11/03
1,REDACTED,en,699,"We've just had an eight-night stay in this hotel and it was magnificent from start to finish. The staff wee attentive, polite, helpful and friendly at all times. Our suite had fantastic views over Shinjuku and I could see Mount Fuji from my bed. 

The breakfast buffet was comprehensive and high quality. Drinks and nibbles in the executive lounge each evening were generous and a lovely end to busy days. The spa/onsen next to the gym is small but excellent. Very clean with nice facilities. 

The hotel is well situated for business or pleasure, in the heart of Shinjuku. Just a 10min stroll to Shinjuku mainline station or even less to a couple of metro stations. 

I can't fault the hotel and look forward to our next visit, next year. A massive thanks to everyone at the Hilton for making our visit so great!",5,2016/11/02
1,REDACTED,en,700,The King City Suite I booked was decent for the price. This review is about the service from the concierge. I emailed the concierge about 2 weeks before my stay in October for restaurant reservations and received no response. ZERO response! I'm very disappointed in the level of service from the concierge and its such a pity that a full service hotel like Hilton Tokyo has staff that overlooks the simplest requests.,1,2016/11/02
1,REDACTED,en,701,"Hilton Tokyo offers the best in luxury accomodation. With its clean rooms, crisp towels and linens and most of all uber service oriented and friendly staff. Guests can avail of the Airport Limousine service from and to Haneda or Narita airport. Another plus factor is the free shuttle service to Shinjuku station. When you are carrying tons of shopping bags... it drops you off literary into your doorsteps.
We stayed in the hotel for 5 nights and we had the best comfort ever. 
We will definitely go back to Hilton Tokyo again",5,2016/11/01
1,REDACTED,en,702,I was most impressed with the exceptional level of service I received throughout my stay at the Hilton. The staff was very attentive to any needs I had. They were responsive to any questions I had and were most accommodating with helping me with directions around the city. I would definitely stay at this hotel again,5,2016/11/01
1,REDACTED,en,703,"I went to the Hyatt before, but it was a little bit compared. I could get the diamond benefits and the room was upgraded to King. One step? The morning of the lounge was relaxed and the restaurant on the first floor was not very good because there were too many people. I also have a menu. Rather, the lounge had more food for me to go to. Please eat it because it is konbred taste. And I did not want to change the room because the toilet water did not come down well. The drainage condition was bad, but that was the case even for the sake of experience. Cleaning did not do it. Did you just touch the towel and touch the futon? It was. Location was right in front of Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office, and view was not bad. I can look at the view in the lounge.",3,2016/11/01
1,REDACTED,en,704,"The Hilton Tokyo is very well located in Shinjuku, close to 3 metro stations. The service is excellent, the rooms are large with a superb view on Tokyo. Shinjuku is an animated area. We strongly recommand the Hilton Tokyo",5,2016/10/31
1,REDACTED,en,705,"This is a very nice, if expensive Hilton hotel. We stayed here for a couple of nights in October and were upgraded to a Tower Suite which is a very large ( by japanese standards) one bedroom suite with a separate living room. The service we received was excellent..The beds are a little on the hard side and so are the pillows, but this is normal for hotels in Japan. The breakfast was very nice with a good choice of smoothies, juices and hot items, we also enjoyed some local dishes. 
The hotel was completely full during our stay and I read beforehand that it can get very busy at breakfast, however we haven't experienced that and there were no queues.
We also visited executive lounge and this was the first time ever that I liked the breakfast at the lounge more than at the main restaurant-there was a variety of berries, fresh orange juice and even champagne in addition to the selection in the main restaurant. The happy hour options were also very good, however no desserts at all. The lounge got very full for the happy hour, but it's not surprising given the size of the hotel..
We either took the shuttle bus from Shinjuku station (every 20 mins), walked (15 mins) or walked from the closest subway station(5 mins), all of which was fine.. Shinjuku area is great with lots of restaurants of all kinds, bars, shopping and whatever else you can wish for.. 
Overall we really enjoyed our stay and received fantastic treatment as HH Diamond members, we will certainly return.

1,REDACTED,en,706,"We went to Japan for our honeymoon and Tokyo was our first stop. We wanted to choose a hotel that was in a good area, and one that wouldn't present a large language barrier. The Tokyo Hilton was a very nice hotel, great rates, good amenities, and the staff were very helpful for all of our needs. It's located in a good area with quick access to everything, and they provide a complimentary shuttle to one of the main metro stations every 20 minutes. If we visit Tokyo again, we will likely stay at this hotel.",5,2016/10/31
1,REDACTED,en,707,"Located about 10min walk to Shinjuku Station or 4min to Nishi-Shinjuku subway, this is a quality Hilton hotel. Excellent concierge and front desk staff. Executive lounge was excellent although it along with breakfast in the lobby in the morning can get very busy. The junior king suite room was excellent, excellent modern bathroom. One improvement is more English tv channels, there was probably only 3-4 available.",4,2016/10/31
1,REDACTED,en,708,"Stayed for 3 nights. Ernesto Bressan is a credit to Hilton Hotels and made sure customer care is fantastic. We had an executive room and the club lounge was wonderful as were the staff who work in it. The view is just fantastic on the 37th floor

Bedroom was gorgeous and bathroom was lovely.

Had breakfast in main dinning room an amazing amount of choice 
Great for walking to train station and shopping centre or there is a free bus if walking takes about 15 minutes maximum.",5,2016/10/30
1,REDACTED,en,709,"I've recently lead a 700+ person conference at this property and I have to say, it is one of the best hotels I've ever hosted an event at world wide. The meeting space is well laid out across the 3rd and 4th floor. The hotel has a variety of bars and dining options. The basement level of this hotel is connected to two metro lines by underground tunnels making exploring the city very easy. There is a limousine transfer bus from either airport direct to the hotel; Narita to the hotel is just over $30. Shinjuku is a vibrant fun area of the city to be located in with wonderful food and bar options and lots of shopping. The final thing I would say about this hotel is that the staff puts it up and over the top. They are highly responsive to all requests. They provide top notch service. I'd absolutely stay here again.",5,2016/10/30
1,REDACTED,en,710,"A nice, large, solid Hilton property. Good location in Shinjuku; walking distance to stores. There are a few restaurants nearby. The hotel restaurants are fairly pricy. 

The rooms were large by Tokyo standards. I had an upgraded room. Large bathroom with shower room. 

I used the lounge, which had a nice assortment of food and cocktails. It was busy, so I was sent to a secondary lounge one of the nights. 

The staff was helpful and friendly. I would stay again.",4,2016/10/30
1,REDACTED,en,711,"Whenever I am in Tokyo, I am residing in this hotel. Nothing is more central than this one. The staff is extremely nice and helpful. The gym could be bigger but still enough to exercise. Everything is easy to reach, underground tube is nearby. It is quiet but still in the middle of business.",5,2016/10/30
1,REDACTED,en,712,"This was my 4th stay at this hotel and I was looking forward to it. Unfortunately, this time my stay was disappointing and together the small inconveniences became rather unpleasant.

1. The dim sum brunch advertised in English was not available in the weekend which was only mentioned in Japanese.
2. I asked for a check-out at 2 pm and they can only give me 1.30 because it was busy. This was quite an inconvenience and what do 30 minutes matter?
3. The TV remote is only in Japanese.
4. Finally, the standard rooms only have a rather uninspiring bathroom with a shower in tub creating a lot of water on the shower floor.
5. In the evening the wifi speed drops dramatically.

The main issue is that the staff is very inflexible : they say sorry a lot, but do not change their position, ever.

All in all it is a beautiful hotel, with a consequent high occupancy rate, but management would do well to teach their staff some more flexibility and issue solving skills, beyond saying sorry, which is essential when traveling.

I don't know if I will return.

1,REDACTED,en,713,"Great hotel, the room was very spacious for Tokyo and very comfy. The staff was fabulous. Nice pre dinner drinks at the sky lounge. Gym is a bit small for a 4* hotel but still very nice as it was not crowded. The breakfast at sky lounge is cozy, good food and fresh squired Orange juice. Would definitely return.",5,2016/10/29
1,REDACTED,en,714,"The hotel appeared to have been renovated recently so it was quite nice to step into a scented lobby that felt fresh and new. The check-in staff was kind and friendly. The concierge service was amazing. The lady at the desk could not do enough for us - she even assisted in booking our train tickets to Nikko and called the next hotel to ensure that we got picked up from the station. The room was good but it wasn't big. However, this is to be expected in Japan. The most important thing was the bed and I am happy to report that it was very comfortable - comfort factor enhanced by king-size pillows. There is a good gym and a small indoor pool (I didn't use the facility but again, the equipment seemed new). Breakfast was a little problematic for me. The space was very tight and because breakfast seemed to be included with the room, it felt like every single guest in the hotel was there at the same time. The breakfast selection wasn't bad but I did get the odd patron who shoved his/her way into my queue. It wasn't the most pleasant eating experience but the hotel isn't to blame. The location is a little off the main drag, which I like since Shinjuku is just too crowded for me. (If truth be told, I am probably too old for Shinjuku. It's probably an area more suited to the young (or young at heart!) I was very pleased that the hotel has its own access to the Marunouchi subway line that links to most sites around town. It's also only a couple of stops away from Shinjuku park, a lovely place for a stroll. I recommend the Hilton and I plan on returning with my family soon.",4,2016/10/29
1,REDACTED,en,715,"This Hilton is crazily busy with lots of guests pouring through its doors each day. It's abut out of Shinjuku, but a half hourly bus shuttle to Shinjuku station deals with this adequately. Despite the crowds, service is good and attentive.",4,2016/10/28
1,REDACTED,en,716,"This should be regarded as one of Hilton's treasured establishments. It is a lovely hotel from the entrance all the way up to the rooms. The property is conveniently located within tons of businesses, shops, restaurants and the train station (underneath the building). 

A doorman greets you upon your arrival and a professional, multi-lingual, cordial and pleasant staff awaits you at the reception. They are all very attentive to your needs and existence. Catching a taxi, taking the hotel shuttle or catching the train can be easily done here. They are all steps outside the door. 

It is a classy establishment with every amenity to offer and satisfy. The rooms were very clean, efficient, spacious and well thought out. The views of the city were incredible!! The Japanese style window sliders added some traditional touches to the room. Modest yukatas and slippers were provided for your enjoyment. It is quite modern and contemporary. The rooms were a delight! The best part of the stay was the beds. This Hilton had the most comfortable, luxurious linens and pillows. When you miss the beds after your departure, that says a lot! Every night was a restful night. Thank you Hilton Tokyo!!!

The Executive Lounge was amazing with a great variety of delicious food, beverages and views. Breakfast can be buffet style or cooked to order in the dining room. No complaints for this property. Everything was a perfect as can be. It definitely deserves a returned trip over and over again. A huge favorite!",5,2016/10/28

1,REDACTED,en,718,"Only stayed 1 night this time. My usual go-to hotel as I like the shinjuku area. Got a room without the shower stall, which is a huge pity

Didn't use the gym this time due to he short stay

They only get limited seats per airport bus, so book early upon check-in

1,REDACTED,en,719,"Great hotel and the service is so on point. From the minute we set foot out the taxi to the minute we left. I've never had such sterling service before. Staff are so helpful, breakfast is so scrumptious and housekeeping were great.",5,2016/10/28
1,REDACTED,en,720,"Thanks for the incorrect listing that caused me to select a smoking room on the app. Then arguing with me for an hour because you wanted to ""upgrade"" my wife and I to a room with two single beds on the 12th floor when we booked for the 34th...",2,2016/10/28
1,REDACTED,en,721,"As you could image from a Hilton, this hotel has everything you could need. I found my experience to be pleasantly luxurious, and the views of Shinjuku were great as we were in a room on one of the higher floors.
The hotel is a 10 minute walk to Shinjuku station, which means that you can get to any part of Japan with very little effort. The service was outstanding, the staff polite and helpful. The room we were in was a Queen room, more than enough for my needs (which were mainly to recover from the jet lag), with an incredibly comfortable bed.
This is not a cheap hotel, but it is certainly worth the cost.",5,2016/10/28
1,REDACTED,en,722,"I stayed at the Hilton Tokyo and I had great service as you would expect at the Hilton group! The location is great, you can walk to many restaurant and sights to see. I will stay here agin. It's a easy walk to the JR rail stop!",4,2016/10/27
1,REDACTED,en,723,The hotel is nicely located in Shinjuku - a good place for business meetings. The rooms are well equipped and the staff is very friendly. The bar is a good place to relax after a busy day in Tokyo. The meeting facilities are modern.,4,2016/10/27
1,REDACTED,en,724,"It was a great stay for us last week there. I am not going to repeat all the good services mentioned in other reviews. Instead, I would like to share some handy information, which I hope to be useful for your stay.

The free shuttle service runs at 12, 32 and 52 of the hour from hotel to Shinjuku station and return to hotel at 00, 20 and 40 of the hour. The shuttle stops at bus stop 21 outside Keio department store. If you arrive by JR train, look for Central West Exit then Keio line direction.
There are also airport bus service from hotel to Narita and Haneda. Ask hotel staff for reservation.

If you need convenient store, there are two choices. A seven eleven store is located at Shinjuku Island Tower, which is 5 min walk towards east in front of the hotel entrance. If you turn west, you will find Maruetsu Petit in Central Park Tower in 6 to 7 min walk. It is a 24 hour supermarket with much more stuff than seven eleven. It also has a laundry service shop at 1st floor, opening 10am to 9pm. If you need to do laundry, this is much convenient than the self service laundry you could find in Google.
",5,2016/10/27
1,REDACTED,en,725,"The hotel was super busy when I was there full of holiday makers, sports groups, loud and rude tourist groups which was so annoying to me. I'm hoping it was just a busy holiday time and the hotel doesn't become a base for certain types of tour groups.

Anyway, I rated the hotel an excellent because despite the hustle and bustle, I felt I recieved very good service from the staff and they did their best to ensure I had a pleasant and enjoyable stay. They all did their best and there were times when the exec lounge was full during breakfast with holiday makers, the staff knowing I was there on business and just wanted to have a quick and quiet breakfast tried their best to get me a table as quickly as possible. 

I'm coming back in a few days and hopefully it will be a quieter experience.",5,2016/10/27
1,REDACTED,en,726,"As a diamond member, I usually get upgraded, however, with a full hotel i received a queen room. It was quite fine even though small. The view was great and the service at all levels was outstanding. The executive lounge was outstanding with better food and drinks than most Hiltons. The hosts and hostess were extremely helpful in giving us guidance on the Subway and the area around Sunjinku. The concierge in the lobby was well versed in English and for those who have never been to Tokyo, I highly recommend this hotel. Look for Kentaro Shimano who was most helpful.",5,2016/10/26
1,REDACTED,en,727,"Tokyo hotels are expensive, but this one is certainly worth the cost. The location is excellent, with underground connection to two metro lines and an easy walk to the Shinjuku shopping and entertainment district.

The service is world class: extremely efficient, polite, and friendly.

The facilities (room, gym, restaurant) were immaculate, comfortable, and expansive.

This is now one of my favorite Hilton properties.",5,2016/10/25

Expensive stay as you can imagine, Nothing to complain about, everything is amazing, the only con is that you cant really walk to shinjuku station or any other attraction, luckily the hotel provides a free shuttle bus service from and to shinjuku station.
Defenetly reccomend this hotel.",5,2016/10/25
1,REDACTED,en,729,Rooms were large and very nice. Especially liked the shower and soaking tub. Breakfast buffet was excellent with a variety of choices. Service was very polite and helpful.

1,REDACTED,en,730,Beautiful hotel with a great location in the center of Nishi-shinjuku. Good choice of restaurants / cafes within the building but my favorite has got to be the bar on the ground floor with a very relaxing atmosphere and dark lighting.,5,2016/10/24
1,REDACTED,en,731,"Stayed here for one night after returning to Tokyo at the end of a 2-week vacation. Booked the room using HHonors Points. I had recently been upgraded to Hilton Gold status and was offered a room upgrade upon checking in. The Guest Relations Manager (Ernesto?) was very courteous and explained a few different room options we could choose from. 

Our room was on the 28th floor and had wonderful views of the Shinjuku area. The room itself was modern and well furnished. With our room also came access to the executive lounge on the 37th floor which we took advantage of twice - once for afternoon snacks and again the following morning for an extensive and scrumptious breakfast spread (a mix of Western and Japanese options).

Check-out was a breeze and the hotel offers a limousine bus service to Narita airport for just 3100 yen which we took advantage of.

I also took advantage of the gym facilities, which were solid but I thought a bit small for a hotel of this size. There is also a pool and tennis court that guests can use.

All in all we had a great experience here and would definitely recommend it for leisure travelers.",5,2016/10/23
1,REDACTED,en,732,"I stayed here 6 nights for business. My room was on the 28th floor and had a great view. It was spacious, modern, and immaculate. Shinjuku Park is across the street and perfect for a morning walk. There is also a shrine in the park. The breakfast on the second floor was very good quality and quick. The buffet includes traditional Japanese fare. Denny’s and Starbucks are right across the street. Shinjuku station is a 10-minute walk and there is also a free Hilton shuttle. There is a ton to see and do near the station. I recommend Memory Lane if you are an adventurous eater and want something a little off the beaten path. The Tokyo government building observatory is a 5-minute walk. There is a shopping area in the basement. The staff was great, without exception, and the concierge will, among other things, help you navigate the subway and train system.",5,2016/10/22
1,REDACTED,en,733,"This Hilton hotel is in a great central location by Shinjuku station so you can easily get to most areas of the city! Access to the executive lounge is definitely a plus as the staff is excellent and always willing to help! There is a happy hour from 6-8 with free wine, beer and spirits definitely a plus considering how expensive everything is in Tokyo. The shuttle bus from Narita drops you off right at the hotel another plus. King executive rooms are a nice size too!",5,2016/10/22
1,REDACTED,en,734,"After an initial mess up with which room we were meant to be in for our four night stay, we were allocated to room 2916, with access to the Executive Lounge as part of our Hhonors membership. Room was clean, comfortable and very quiet with excellent views over the Shinjuku area and the Lounge was consistently very good. Hotel is well located for tourists as the nearby Shinjuku station is one of the main hubs - the hotel runs a shuttle every 20 minutes, or you can walk it in 10. Restaurants are of good quality and service was good.",5,2016/10/21

Never need to worry that it's far from JR station, there is shuttle bus available after crazy shopping in lumine & keio. 

It's well connected to metro (underground) if u come back late from dinner. 

High commended the local restaurant 丸雞 nearby",5,2016/10/17
1,REDACTED,en,740,"Stayed in a Junior King suite with executive lounge access. Hilton Gold member and was automatically upgraded without even needing to ask!

Beds were amazingly comfortable. Room spacious with modern and sleek fitout. Shower pressures were on the weak side but still comfortable. The views over the shinkuki skyline both during the day and evening were spectacular. 

Highly recommend staying in a room with access to executive lounge. Access to drinks including alcoholic beverage throughout the day is an absolute bonus for those taking a leisurely holiday. The evening sessions serving canapes can get very busy though - once we had to be sent away to wait in our rooms as it was full! It also offers dedicated check-in/out service.

I had some concern initially about the location. However, I can assure you most won't find this a problem at all. The shuttle runs frequently between the hotel and shinjuku station, and a relaxed safe stroll took around 15min only. Hiltopia shopping arcade directly underground also has a convenience store, boosting the hotel's convenience.

Breakfast buffet was delicious with a variety of Western & Japanese selections, and a wide range of freshly made smoothies and morning drinks.

Overall, very satisfied. Would definitely return.",5,2016/10/17
1,REDACTED,en,741,"I paid more money than my budget since it was Hilton but it didn't took much time 
that my choice was wrong.

1. The room size was moderate considering Japanese hotel's standard.

2. The breakfast restaurant was located in lobby floor, it was always full of people, 
always there was some waiting time.

3. The location is not to far from Shinjuku station but it is not close.

4. Wifi was not free, you need to join HHonors to use free wifi.
I believe that the premium hotel shoud offer free wifi at all time without requesting any futher joining.

5. The food taste in reastaurant was pretty good.

6. The one surprising is that all hotel staff can speak english fluently, this is awesome
considering I was in Japan.

I also went to the bar for a cocktail and thought it was very nice.
My room came with executive lounge access but when I went to look at this it was packed and i couldn't get in so take that into account if you are expecting somewhere quite to relax.

Breakfast buffet was very good and staff were extremely pleasant and very helpful. Would certainly stay here again.",4,2016/10/14
1,REDACTED,en,746,"This was my first time to Japan and we chose the Hilton for it's location, price and reviews. I read other reviews mentioning it's location in a business district with not much around however I found this perfect. It gave a respite from the hustle and bustle of central Shinjuku or Shibuya. Room was awesome and much bigger than expected, slept like a baby. The only downside was the bathroom which had no fan and steamed up like a sauna. We had breakfast included and the spread was extensive and included both western and Japanese options. Service was spectacular - I actually get really special staying here just because of the service. Highly recommended",4,2016/10/14
1,REDACTED,en,747,"This should be seen as a solid 4 Star business hotel that fails in its efforts to achieve a higher statis. I stayed in an Executive Room and my first disappointment was that the window was far smaller than that illustrated on the Hilton Web site. Further, on all 3 nights of my stay, when I went to use the Executive Lounge (access to which I paid dearly in the room rate) I (and others) were told it was full and to wait in line in the hallway. This is shameful and at least we should have been offered two drink coupons to use at the second floor bar. The ""upscale"" restaurants on the second floor of the hotel made up one vast venue, which felt far from relaxing or exclusive. The breakfast buffet in the Executive Lounge was ok, but nothing great, and the ground floor breakfast buffet (which I was entitled to use as a Gold Member) was large and noisy with many tables a great distance from the buffet but bordering on the hotel lobby. The room was clean as expected, and service throughout the hotel was courteous, but lacked the warmth and sincerity one finds at similarly priced hotels in Tokyo. The location was next to a hospital and office buildings and while there was a shuttle bus going to Shinjuku Station, I'd have preferred a hotel closer to restaurants and shopping. Bottom Line: Recommended only if one has business close by, but otherwise there are better choices at the same price point.",4,2016/10/13
1,REDACTED,en,748,"Hilton is conveniently located around 700m from the Shinjuku railway station, shops and nightlife. There is a shuttle bus that takes you there and back to Shinjuku station every 20 minutes. The room was spacious, modern and clean. The bathroom has a separate shower and the bed was very comfortable. We love the George bar and they serve the best passion fruit mojito.",5,2016/10/13

1,REDACTED,en,750,"Stayed here for 1 night before flying back home. We had a king room and the room was massive! So much space for us to lay out all three of our suitcases. The staff here is helpful and friendly as well. The best part about this hotel is we were able to store our suitcases here for 4 nights before our arrival. Any other hotel we asked only allowed us to store it for the day, no overnights. We received complimentary breakfast as well and the buffet breakfast here is amazing. Lots of options both American and Japanese. There is also a complimentary shuttle bus that brings your to Shinjuku Station, so it was very convenient and the airport limousine stops and picks up from this hotel as well.",5,2016/10/11

1,REDACTED,en,752,"We stayed at this hotel a couple of times in the last year. Even though it does not hit the 'wow' factor overall, it is incredibly well run and maintained for the property of this size. As HHonors Diamond, we were upgraded on both occasions to lovely rooms/suites with impressive views. The Executive Lounge gets very busy in the evening however much team-work is going into making everyone comfortable and ensuring that snacks, drinks etc. are replenished. The location is fantastic if you need to be in that area of Tokyo.",5,2016/10/09
1,REDACTED,en,753,"Okay, we've got to pay a lot for the one Night. But in this city, i think, this hotel gives one the best value. Besides the spacious room: Indoor pool and gym and very good breakfast. It has got an underground access to tokyo metro.",5,2016/10/08
1,REDACTED,en,754,The location is excellent. The fact that the limo bus picks you at the airport and drops you at the door of the hotel for a reasonable price is a great plus.

1,REDACTED,en,755,"This is a great hotel for business travelers. Vacationers may want something more central. On foot there were not a lot of choices for dinner and we were forced to eat on site. Not a bad thing, but not a great thing. 
The rooms are a bit tight, but the amenities are in line with Hilton. 
The real win is the excellent Executive Lounge which makes up for anything else. The staff was marvelous and the selections for food and drink were generous. 
Again the only downside is the location is not tourist friendly, but the subway is a short walk underground from the lobby.",4,2016/10/07

My room had NO stationary and whilst I do not usually look for this I did need it this occasion. I asked concierge and I was delivered ONE sheet of paper. I am a Hilton Honors member and was NOT impressed. Excellent free shuttle to Shinjuku Stn works very well every 20 mins.
There are several quality restaurants in the hotel Very good but be warned VERY expensive",4,2016/10/05
1,REDACTED,en,757,"Stayed 5 nights for a Mother/Daughter birthday, shopping trip. Arrived to find a special birthday gift, fruit platter and birthday card awaiting in our room. Lovely! Booked an Executive Club Suite during their 50% off Suite sale. Worked out to be seriously reasonable. Great location....used the hotel to and from Shinjuku everyday. Enjoyed breakfast in both the downstairs restaurant and also the Club Lounge. Lounge was a great place to unwind after long days of walking, shopping and sightseeing. There was also afternoon tea on offer but how much food can one consume? Hotel guest relations was perfect and the concierge was so helpful with booking restaurants and organising the airport bus etc. Helpful tip: look out for any sales on the Hilton website! As their current promotion says ""Stop Clicking Around"" and just book on their website!",5,2016/10/05
1,REDACTED,en,758,"We stayed here in September 2013 but totally forgot to add this wonderful experience. 
I think Tokyo is a wonderful city anyway so everything is in it makes it a pleasure.
Hilton hotel is known as a good hotel in Asia so not much to say about our time there. They have nice spacious rooms (dont forget to ask for a high floor), they have great services and good food.
They have a shuttle bus from/to airport and also offer a small bus for taking you to the railway station and bus station from where you reach any corner of Tokyo. It comes at exact time estimated, not 1 minute earlier or later.
The internet works good/with cost.
The breakfast is super tasty.
The personal is nice just like all people that live in Japan. 
This is a totally different air then Europe, USA and even rest of Asia..it's another world!",5,2016/10/04
1,REDACTED,en,759,"A good base in this metroplolis is essential, and Hilton Tokyo at Shinjuku is an oasis. As a HHonors elite member was afforded access to the lovely Executive Lounge (which was sometimes overcrowded unfortunately) and upgraded to a lovely suite.",5,2016/10/04
1,REDACTED,en,760,"Beautiful view from the room, on the 25th floor. Classy lobby and dining area. Buffet breakfast was very yummy, and filling! Staff were excellent with great service. The beds were very comfy and the air conditioner worked well. 
Being a 5 star hotel we were expecting a 5 star room. Even though we were upgraded to a deluxe King, the room was disappointing. The 4 star hotel we stayed in in Kyoto was better! The Hilton bathroom was tiny and the shower always leaked beneath the glass onto the bathroom floor, due to a poor design. 
Overall a nice stay, but we were expecting more.",4,2016/10/04
1,REDACTED,en,761,"We stayed here for two nights at the end of our trip to Japan, on arrival at Shinjuku station we thought it would be easy to navigate our way to the hotel via the warren of tunnels, but this proved difficult and we perhaps should have waited for the shuttle bus or just walked it above ground! When we finally arrived at around 1400 unfortunately our room was not available, which was a slight annoyance as I am a HHonors Diamond member, but we were able to wait in the executive lounge until 1500 when it became available, we did however get a room upgrade to a deluxe room on a high floor.

The room was great, staff friendly, but breakfast was a bit of a let down, this could have been due to the fact that the main breakfast restaurant was being renovated during our visit, so everything was laid out a bit oddly in the other restaurant area on the first floor. Service during breakfast was also a bit average with staff clearing our table when we went up for second helpings and not being asked for tea or coffee one morning.

Executive lounge is good, and the bar also serves great cocktails, although not sure about the DJ kicking in a 2200 on a Monday night!",4,2016/10/03
1,REDACTED,en,762,"Spent 6 nights at the hilton recently.
We were upgraded to the executive floor with free breakfast on the second leg of our trip. The lounge offers afternoon tea and pre dinner drinks (though we didn't try them). Standard fare for breakfast. A good variety of asian and western options. 

Location wise, the hotel is in a great location. It's a 5 min walk to 2 different metro stations and a shuttle ride away from the main shinjuku station.",5,2016/10/03
1,REDACTED,en,763,"The Hilton is very close to Shinjuku station and from that station you can get to anywhere in Tokyo on the subway. Underneath the Hilton is Hiltopia which has nice shops and you can walk to a nearby subway station which is just one stop from Shinjuku. The staff is very helpful and speaks and understands English comfortably. The rooms are spacious enough by American standards and very comfortable. The Executive Lounge is the best we have ever seen in our travels throughout the world. Upgrade to gain access if you can, it is worth it. When we go back to Tokyo we will definitely stay there.",5,2016/10/03
1,REDACTED,en,764,"We had 3 lovely nights here, huge hotel but a very buzzy feel about it. Staff were great and as Diamond members we were upgraded to a suite. Big room, comfy bed, great bathroom and big for Japan. Club Lounge was wonderful, a busier club than some but we could always get a table and drinks. The breakfast on level 2 was not as busy as the lobby, however lobby breaky opened at 5am which was handy on the day we checked out. All the staff were lovely too and concierge especially helpful and patient. Location wise - not a lot directly in the area but only a 15 min walk to Shinjuku which we found easier than navigating the train system! Highly recommend and would stay again if in Tokyo.",5,2016/10/02
1,REDACTED,en,765,"We dined at ''Marble lounge'' in weekday evening. They served a dinner buffet for 5100yen(not including tax & service charge). 
Maybe this price is cheaper than other foreign affiliated foreign hotel in this district, then a lot of women groups were in there. Consequently, long queue was in front of the buffet counter.... And each staff is so busy, then we could not have a relax dinner at all. Staffs broken dishes three times during our dinner...
Here is nice for having a budget dinner, but difficult to have a relaxed dinner with kind of sober ambience .",3,2016/10/01

1,REDACTED,en,767,"It is rare to have a perfect experience with a hotel however all our expectations were exceeded during our stay.

We arrived at the hotel at 9am after 16 hour journey hoping for an early check but expecting to have to wait until early afternoon. Reception was very helpful in ensuring that housekeeping cleaned the room as soon as the previous guests checked out so we could have a shower. We were able to wait in the Executive Lounge and the room was ready for us at 12.

The room was spacious, modern and one of the cleanest hotel rooms I have stayed in. The bathroom has a separate shower / bath wet room and the bed was very comfortable. We stayed 3 nights and we would happily have stayed for longer.

The hotel is conveniently located and is only around 700m from the Shinjuku railway station, shops and nightlife. There is a shuttle bus that takes you there and back however the walk only takes around 5 - 10 minutes depending on your walking speed. There is a metro station just around the corner from the hotel which connects to all railway lines. Wi-FI speed is one of the fastest I have encountered at any hotel and connectivity was never lost even when moving between floors.

We used the Executive Lounge on the 37th floor each day for breakfast. We had the option of eating downstairs as well where there is a greater selection however the range of breakfast in the lounge was still extensive including eggs and omelettes.

Service levels are exemplary and all facilities are regularly cleaned throughout the day.

On departure we were able to arrange a late check out at 2pm and we were able to use the lounge until we left for the airport at 4pm. I would happily return next time we are back in Tokyo.",5,2016/09/30

I mean , there's literally everything. Nothing to add, is always the best ...

Taxi's were always available.",5,2016/09/29

The club lounge itself is nice but the food on offer at cocktails is a bit ordinary and could be better. You won't skip dinner for what is on offer there. The drinks though are what one would expect. 
There is a small pool which isn't much use for laps but ok to cool off in. 
The location of the hotel is great as its a 5 min walk to Shinjuku station where there is tons of shopping and a million restaurants and bars. 
The steak house in the hotel itself is very good but of course not cheap.",4,2016/09/25

1,REDACTED,en,779,"After staying in other Tokyo hotels you really appreciate the Hilton more. While the rooms are not huge, they are large in comparison to other Tokyo hotels within the same price range. The bathrooms are clean and not the pre-fab style you find in many other Japanese hotel rooms. The service went above and beyond. Special shout out to Ernesto of Guest Relations was so nice and worked diligently to assist us with rooms during a week where the hotel was fully booked. While the breakfast area is busy we never had to wait for a table or prepared egg dishes. Food was replenished quickly and efficiently. Overall, our 3 night stay was wonderful.",5,2016/09/23
1,REDACTED,en,780,"The hotel itself is quite old but the interior is still very new and beautiful. I am a Diamond member but could not get upgraded to a better room (they said my room is already a ""newly renovated"" room but in my experince it is just a standard room and even smaller than the one I stayed with points 3 years ago). Service is standard Japanese style. Didn't have chance to try their breakfast as I could not wake up early. 

There is quite a distance from Shinjuku station. A shuttle bus running between the station and the hotel in 20 mins intervals but after the service ends the walk will be around 20 mins given that you don't get lost.

Overall it's a good hotel but with that price and as an elite member I expected more than what I got.

酒店不錯但作為鑽石會員竟然得不到房間升級，跟我說已經為我升級到新裝修房間但跟我三年前住的沒甚麼差而且更小。酒店是不錯但以他的價位和作為高級會員我認為有點不足夠。",3,2016/09/22
1,REDACTED,en,781,"Beautifully decorated Hilton hotel, perfectly located 10-15 mins walk from Shinjuku station, allowing you to explore all of Tokyo. Food was fabulous (although it should be noted that with such a high standard comes an equally high price tag). We stayed in one of the executive rooms (modern and spacious, with all amenities provided) as well as the privilege to use the executive lounge serving snacks and drinks throughout the day till 8pm. Staff are incredibly polite and helpful; we had a complicated issue with our booking (due to our travel agents fault) but the reception staff patiently worked quickly to resolve the issue. Hotel also provides a nice gym and swimming pool. Super fast Wifi.

Also, easy to catch the Narita Express from that station. The hotel is a dream!",5,2016/09/22
1,REDACTED,en,783,"Full disclosure: Today was only our first day (of five) here at the hotel. But they have impressed me more in 16 hours than many hotels have done in 16 days, and I had to come here immediately to share that fact.

We are in Japan for our honeymoon, but it honestly feels more like we're on a royal visit. From the moment we arrived, their hospitality has been absolutely outstanding. We were warmly welcomed in the lobby by a hostess who took our bags and showed us to the front desk. The receptionist was very kind and helpful, and wished us a ""Happy Honeymoon!"" before offering us a room upgrade on the 28th floor with a great view. She also offered us complimentary early check-in (at 9am!), which - after having just gotten off an 11-hour flight and being desperate to freshen up - we could not have been more grateful for.
And this may sound like a silly thing to comment on, but the lobby smells wonderful!! The Guest Relations Manager here at the hotel overheard me telling my husband how amazing the lobby smelled, and went out of his way to tell us all about the Sencha Green Tea fragrance and that it's available to purchase. I won't be leaving Tokyo without it. 
We arrived in our room (which is HUGE - especially by Japanese standards), and our bags were brought up shortly after. We decided to order room service from the 24-hour breakfast menu to fuel up for the day ahead, and not only did it arrive promptly, but it was also set up beautifully on a rolling table, delivered by a server who genuinely wanted to make sure our every need was met, and tasted incredible. It may be the best French Toast (and bananas!) I've ever had.
A short while later we received a knock on our door, and were surprised with a beautiful fruit plate and an assortment of small cakes to enjoy, along with a note once again wishing us a ""Happy Honeymoon!"". And enjoy them we did. I have never been so floored by the taste of grapes before, and I mean that in all honesty. They were the size of golf balls and tasted like they were made of pure joy and magic. And that's just the grapes. 
Did the welcome stop there? Heck no, it didn't! We had another knock on our door shortly afterward, and were presented with lovely flowers in a beautiful little vase, as ""a gift from everyone at Hilton"".
Seriously, just stop your hotel search right now. This is the one. I could tell you all about how convenient and central the location is, or how close it is to the metro/trains, or how beautifully decorated it is, or how amazingly comfortable the room is, or its fantastic value for money, but the level of service and hospitality has exceeded our expectations to the extent that I really don't need to. It's really just that good.
I've been an HHonors member for a while now, and have stayed at Hilton hotels across the globe, and I honestly believe that the Hilton Tokyo is far and away the best one in the world. Truly outstanding.",5,2016/09/21
1,REDACTED,en,784,"I stayed here from 8-13SEP2016. And I've stayed at MANY Hiltons around the world. But I really think this could be the BEST HILTON IN THE WORLD. Why, you ask? First, good price value. Second, great location in Shinjuku with easy access to two metro lines, free shuttle to Shinjuku Station, and the Airport Limousine Bus picks up here. Third, beautifully-appointed rooms with all the amenities you could want. Fourth, EXCELLENT executive lounge with tasty appetizers, pour-your-own liquor, 37th floor views, all-day-long beer, in a great setting. Fifth, the breakfast included an outstanding mix of East and West where they leave a full carafe of coffee on your table and feed you well.

But the real core strength of this hotel is its staff. At check-in, the staff and manager went far above and beyond to get us checked in early and with a huge amount of information for our stay in Tokyo. Every interaction with the concierge, breakfast staff, lounge staff...everybody was fantastic! I've stayed at other higher-end hotels in Japan and none of them compare to the level of service, language ability, and professionalism provided by the Hilton Tokyo. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and am eager to return!",5,2016/09/20

1,REDACTED,en,786,"Perfect hotel for buisness /leisure trip to Tokyo, Japan. For anyone travelling as a first timer to Tokyo it's a bit like New York you have to pick a suburb. I've picked Shinjuku the reason being its so easy to access from the airport, Tokyo station if coming from Osaka and its train & subway stations allow you to travel anywhere. The Hilton is the first stop on the airport limousine bus, very easy to check in with fluent English/German & Spanish. Buffet style breakfast with a coffee bar, a gym, a pool and the rooms are modern and cosy. From the hotel you can access the under ground subway system which is great if it's really hot/humid or raining. An excellent concierge desk and staff that can help your every need. It's about 10(fast) min walk from shinjukus main bus and train stations and shopping/eating/partying streets. There is a complimentary shuttles bus which drops you to the station door, starts at 8.30am. Staff were really nice and helpful at all times. I'd stay here again, I liked the way the gym is open 24hrs as if you're struggling to sleep at night it's nice to head to it. I did not try the restaurant in the hotel for dinner as there are some AMAZING food choices near by.",4,2016/09/18
1,REDACTED,en,787,"A very well managed hotel. Everything you would expect and more. Did not meet a staff member who did not smile and seem honored to assist you. Very refreshing. The Hilton Honors Club is exceptional. We were upgraded to an executive room and it was huge 
For any country much less Japan. And the water pressure is outstanding ! Great for sore backs, shoulders and feet. 

The only drawback is that their is very limited seating in the lobby. A couple of benches and 2 chairs which can be difficult at times. So does this make it as low as a 4 star or just not a 5 star? You decide.

Many thanks to the following: Housekeeping staffs which did an excellent job maintaining and cleaning our room everyday, also to the hotel housekeeping maintenance man who went to our room promptly and fix the safe deposit box twice which was not working properly at that time, the 1st time we were in the room and the 2nd time we were out but we authorized the hotel maintenance man to go in anyway to fix the problem. The safe deposit box issue was solve immediately within 48 hours. Bell captain and staffs very attentive and helpful in taking care of our luggages both check in and out. Front Desk Staffs provide excellent customer service. Will recommend this hotel to anyone going Tokyo for business or vacation.",5,2016/09/16
1,REDACTED,en,789,"If you are coming to Tokyo for anything other than business, then great, it is a very well equipped and managed hotel. However, if you are planning on coming for business - don't. I have tried to split my review as a business and non-business visitor, so at least it is balanced. 

We chose the Hilton as we are members of Hilton Honors. As such, we expected the Tokyo Hilton to be business centric. It is not. In fact, I would go as far as to say, that if you come to Tokyo on business, do not stay here. It simply isn't suitable. 

Upon checking in at midnight, we were advised that the Business Centre would be open in the morning, and able to provide translation services for us. This wasn't the case. The ""Business Centre"" isn't actually a Business Centre at all. It is simply a large open-plan floor area with a few PCs and desks.

This might suit some, but when business guests need assistance to resolve business queries you need staff, but the hotel doesn't employ any in the Business Centre. Not even one. Also, you would expect a Business Centre to at least have a phone, yet this one doesn't.

Similarly, it doesn't have any meeting rooms either, so if you want privacy you can't get any. Rather bizarrely, privacy is a mute point at this hotel. It is simply not on the managements agenda when it comes to the Business Centre or indeed anywhere else in the hotel. There are simply no private areas business people can work from, as the hotel is so busy. I have posted a picture of us trying to work at the same time as the flight crew of a Lufthansa jet were being checked in around us. How bizarre - especially when you consider the check-in desk is some 100m away. 

As there were no dedicated Business Centre staff, we had to hire in a translator to help with the communications. Not ideal, but on its own not a deal breaker either. However, without a quiet room to work from or a phone to work with, we were forced to retreat to our bedroom to make the calls. Now this was a deal breaker and unacceptable having strangers in your room plus other work colleagues perching on the edge of the bed. 

In defence of the management, they did offer to help out using Guest Services and the Concierge - so they at least tried. However, the hotel is simply not equipped to run as an effective business hotel. 

On the non-business front, the hotel is great. It is approximately 30 minutes drive from Haneda Airport. Is centrally located and next door to a subway station. Taxis are easy to get and the concierge desk runs a very helpful service. 

A large number of restaurants and cafes are situated right next door, so you can sample a number of different styles of Japanese food at reasonably good prices. The breakfast buffet is okay, but nowhere near as good as an Intercontinental. 

Rooms are okay too. Disappointing to be given a single bed without any warning, but hey lots of people have worse things to worry about.",2,2016/09/13
1,REDACTED,en,790,"It's nice to stay in the Shinjuku area, because it gives you a lot of choices for eating and shopping, and many are really good. Hilton Shinjuku sits in the nicer part of Shinjuku, with many high rising buildings around it, giving it a very modern metropolis vibe. Tokyo at its coolest.

Service was friendly and helpful. We learned about the shuttle service from hotel to the Shinjuku station, which was convenient. There is also a bus service to Narita Airport but there is a fee. 

The room was really nice and comfortable, loved the red leathered arm chair by the window. Bathroom amenities was also a highlight, with the kimono bathrobe adding another great touch to our Japanese vacation.",5,2016/09/13
1,REDACTED,en,791,"I had redeemed my points to stay at this hotel because of Hilton's reputation. The hotel is crowded, has a lot of guests, and as a result, value of HHonors seems to have reduced over time. Despite HHonors Gold status for 3 years, I was not given a room upgrade on check-in, and even after I was told I would be upgraded on my last day, I was upgraded to an executive suite only with basic amenities and the same size of the room. During the entire time, it was almost like they were doing me a favor. My father joined our family in Tokyo and I made him change his reservation to this hotel, given its reputation. He is also a Gold member. He was upgraded to a two single bed Executive Suite. I got a feeling this hotel does not truly want to upgrade Gold members. Possibly the only place I felt well-treated on occasion was in the Executive Lounge. It is peaceful and calm, with great views, good drink options (juice, non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages, tea and coffee). The snacks are a nice touch. Its a great place to get away from the otherwise crowded hotel. Public bath and pool are nice. Lap pool is indoors and relaxing. Their massages (both in center and in room) are a bit pricey but certainly are very good and professional. The breakfast is very good. However, the staff are unable to control people who are in there. For all three days we were in the breakfast area (Marble Lounge), there was an odd-looking man wearing a pink-colored jumpsuit, who would sip tea for hours staring at people. Once he even randomly screamed at the top of his voice without provocation. On the last day, he kept a teddy bear on his table. My infant daughter was attracted to his teddy bear and kept running towards him. When I discussed this with the staff, they were sympathetic, and told me ""to keep my daughter far away from him"". They could not do anything to stop his strange behavior, though they told me he had been coming there before, and appeared to not be happy with him. I feel sorry for the staff, but the hotel really needs to control the kind of people coming in, and certainly treat HHonors guests better. It really did not feel like a good use of my points, and I will likely stay in another hotel in Tokyo the next time around.",4,2016/09/13
1,REDACTED,en,792,"I've been coming here for over 25 years. This hotel has been consistent over this period of time. The in-house breakfast is expensive, and I tend to walk downstairs to the restaurants there… Or a breakfast at Shinjuku station. Rooms are clean & well-stocked mini-bar. Fitness Center (6th floor) is great with swimming, elipto, cable weights & hottub. A free shuttle to/from Shinjuku Sta. runs every 15-20min. Walking around Shinjuku west side cannot be missed, and be sure to check-out Tokyo City Hall ""skyscraper""!",4,2016/09/11
1,REDACTED,en,793,"I spent a huge amount of time investigating hotels right across Tokyo and couldn't have been happier with the Hilton. The staff were helpful and friendly and we received a complimentary up-grade upon arrival.

We thought the location was good for us, close enough to walk to the action, but far enough away too. The Hilton shuttle is a great service, but don't think you can't walk either! The hotel is also convenient for the underground as two different lines runs right by it and you can get ANYWHERE from there!

Breakfast:
- Many breakfast options, both for asian as american as european. 
- Excellent service of the breakfast staff.

Executive Lounge:

All was good, nothing to complain.",5,2016/09/09
1,REDACTED,en,796,"We stayed for 10 nights, family of four in mid August (1 adult, 2 teenagers and 1 child). Our room was spacious on the 25th floor (request higher floors for better views), we had a city view which the children were very pleased with. The beds were very comfortable and room cleaned every day which was nice as we could go out without having to worry about making beds etc. We were upgraded to the complimentary executive lounge which is highly recommended as it gives you access to free internet and lounge offers drinks and light refreshments/snacks which we enjoyed.

Breakfast buffet is a must! It served variety of delicious food and we enjoyed the freshly cooked omelette, fried/scrambled eggs etc. 

The hotel appears to cater mainly for business people. However, we were always made welcomed. The environment was very relaxed, friendly staff and the lobby area was professional and welcoming.

The complimentary shuttle service is a bonus especially with children. It was helpful especially after a long day of sightseeing. The shuttle service is extremely punctual! We really liked that the shuttle bus was always on time and could plan our day around it. The shuttle can only carry 40 passengers and most of the time we were able to get a seat. To walk to Shinjiku takes around15 minutes in case, you miss the last shuttle service which is at 9:40 p.m. 

The staff were very helpful, nothing is too much trouble, which made our stay much more enjoyable.

1,REDACTED,en,801,"I picked this hotel because of it's location. It is very centrally located and easy walking distance to many great areas. We took the train in from the airport and the hotel does have a free shuttle to and from the train station. When we checked in, the staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was large, upscale, clean and modern. The bed was comfortable and the free wifi quick and reliable. The view of the city from my room was fantastic. But where this hotel really shines is it's club lounge/breakfast options. As a HHonors Diamond member, I get free lounge access for drinks/snacks in the evening and breakfast in the morning. Here I was told that I could either take breakfast in the club lounge or enjoy the full HUGE breakfast buffet in the hotel's main restaurant. We went to the club lounge on the first night and while it is the biggest lounge I have ever been in, they told us that Diamond members get to go to a second smaller lounge as well. It was incredibly upscale with fantastic free drink and food options. For breakfast the next morning, we went to the buffet in the main restaurant. It was huge and the food was great. Dozens of different tables had many Western and Asian options. And everyone we dealt with at the hotel was so helpful and friendly. They did a great job of reinforcing the Hilton brand. I would really recommend this hotel.",5,2016/09/05
1,REDACTED,en,802,"I have been a regular guest of this hotel since the 1990s, and I have mixed feelings about what this hotel has become. The rooms are spacious by the Japanese standards, and the location is good--within walking distance (10+ minutes) of the central areas of Shinjuku but not in the middle of the craziness. Also, the hotel offers a range of restaurant options. The shuttle service to JR Shinjuku Station, Airport Limousine Bus, etc., too, are quite useful. Also, the recent renovations made their rooms more pleasant.

With this said, I feel compelled to point out that they aren't what they used to be. I miss the smooth transactions I used to enjoy at the reception desk, for instance. Although there is a person or two directing guests, the U-shaped reception area can now create a chaotic impression--with a dramatic increase in the number of non-Japanese Asian guests who do tend to be quite loud and ignore the line(s)/staff directions.

The breakfast is the same way. Although the selection is a little limited, if you have lounge access, it would be wise to utilize the Exec Lounge for breakfast because the 1st-floor restaurant can get absolutely chaotic--and I don't remember this happening until a few years ago. Perhaps it's time for them to implement some serious crowd-control strategies.

The quality of the front desk staff, too, has become a little inconsistent in the recent years, in my view. For instance, the last time my same-sex spouse and I checked in, the Japanese male agent wanted to confirm a couple of times that we knew our junior suite only had one king-size bed. When he realized that we were a couple, his attitude changed completely. It's 2016, and it is Hilton. Maybe the manager needs to remind the employees that, at times, they may get same-sex couples whom they should treat with equal respect? This was shocking to me because, in my 20+ years of visiting Japan frequently, I've found the Japanese--male or female--to be very gay friendly. More importantly, my spouse and I have been staying at Hilton Tokyo since the 1990s, and this has never happened before.

On another recent occasion, a European male employee took care of the check-out process. For some reason, he rushed us so badly that he didn't even tell us the total charges and merely handed over an envelope with the folio as he asked about our credit card (it wasn't even crowded). Although he had been friendly up to that point, he made his discontent somewhat clear when I asked him to go over the charges. I should have perhaps pointed out to him that this entire transaction could have been prevented, had he done his job and taken an extra 6.5 seconds to inform us of the total charges.

Just 10 years ago, these things would have been unthinkable at Hilton Tokyo.

There are so many nice hotels in Tokyo that offer more updated infrastructure, good meal options and great service these days (heck, in Japan, the cheapest of the hotels would give you pretty good service!) but, as an HHonors elite member, I prefer to stick with Hilton. Luckily, another Hilton, Hilton Tokyo Odaiba, has recently opened in (relatively) central Tokyo, and I find its infrastructure, service and meal options to be far superior--although it is in an area that COULD be slightly trickier to navigate. I really WANT TO like Hilton Tokyo and WANT TO stay with them because I prefer Shinjuku over Odaiba, but they have been slipping a little in the recent years.",3,2016/09/05
1,REDACTED,en,803,The family of four could stay in a junior suite comfortably. The staff was great and the service was very quick. The bathroom is rather small but very clean. The shuttle between the hotel and Shinjuku station was very convenient.,5,2016/09/04
1,REDACTED,en,804,"After getting off the taxi. I was warmly greeted by the staff, he was all smiley and sincere which I really appreciated after a long ride from narita to the hotel. 

Check in was pretty quick, however there's no signages to tell you where to stand and wait for check in or out. So guests are just standing anywhere and everywhere. A little confusing. 

Room was decent and big for Japanese standard but a little worn out. 

One downside of the room that I really need to point out is the carpet, it looks and feels filthy dirty. I stepped on some sticky residue 3 times and god knows what it is, I had to place napkins on the spots so please do wear the bathroom slippers provided. I got them to clean the carpet twice !! 

Generally all the Japanese staff were friendly and helpful I really appreciate it. But this particular staff ""Mari*a"" at the concierge was not very sincere in helping when I asked for directions and informations, she doesn't even look you in the eye and I felt she just wants me to leave her alone. So I approach a Japanese staff later and she made it all very clear. 

I was staying at the Hilton Narita earlier in August, I must say Hilton Tokyo Hotel and the one at Narita are worlds apart!! I will never ever stay at Hilton Narita again , service was really at the rock bottom and that was my first Hilton experience they totally ruined it. 

However Hilton Tokyo changed my first impression that I had from Hilton Narita. I will definitely stay at Hilton Tokyo in my 5 upcoming trips next year !!

Room: our junior suite was large and well kept. It had all the amenities we needed and the room was quiet.

Lounge: the food offering was ample and fresh. We tried the other breakfast locations on the main floors of the hotel. Although they had more options, we liked the cozy setting of the lounge.

Other services: the hotel provided free shuttle (although a bit infrequent) to the main stretch of Shinjuku. That saved us a lot of walking/taxi fare.

Service: every staff member we encountered was super nice and helpful. We visited the main lobby's concierge for lots of trip planning and the nice lady (with glasses, can't remember name) was spot on with all her recommendations!

I would definitely stay here again in the future!",5,2016/09/01

I went back two or three times during the day, and ever experience was perfect - they didn't rush me and they were able to explain everything so well, from which train to board to what time was best to see a given site. 

The staff behind the front desk were equally great. The restaurant staff was great too (yes, the food was insanely expensive - but for those times when we didn't have the energy to head out, the convenience was worth the price). 

The Hilton is about a ten minute's walk to Shinjuku station, from which point you can very easily get anywhere in Tokyo or beyond. We didn't hesitate to make the walk two or three times a day.

We also had a dinner at metropolitan grill restaurant in the hotel which was superb. The breakfast spread was generous.

1,REDACTED,en,827,"Stayed 4 nights recently with my wife and daughter at Hilton. As a HHonors Diamond member was upgraded to a beautiful 1 bedroom suite; very comfortable for the 3 of us. The executive level lounge has great views of the city, ample amount of beverages, wine, champagne and booze to choose from. The food is a little light but it's enough to eat a bit before heading out in Tokyo for great food. The service that we received over the 4 nights was above and beyond. Again, as HHonors at check in they are aware of status but concierge and staff had no idea and they treat each guest with great respect. If you do stay at this property, please visit the concierge and ask for Marina. This lady is awesome!! As this was my 1st time in Tokyo, I had many questions and things to see/do on my list while in town. My 1st morning I approached her with my list and she took the time to break down what I should do day 1 and not only what I should do but in what order and gave me directions of how to reach each destination. After an extended discussion, Marina told me don't do more than we scheduled for the day and to come visit her tomorrow for her to map out my 2nd & 3rd day. Well, with her guidance and great knowledge of the city, within our 4 nights we were able to see everything within Tokyo that we were interested in and had enough time on our final day to get a day trip to Mt. Fuji/Hakone. Marina is a tremendous asset and it doesn't stop with her. Upon check in, we had the pleasure to have Sophie (from the UK) bring our bags up and she took time to sit with us and give us a break down of the property. After explaining all of our benefits she reviewed a city map with me and explained where we were in location to the city and also provided a locals view of the major attractions.

I was on a high floor and had a good view over the skyline of Tokyo. Comfortable bed and Japanese style deep bath.
The Executive lounge is great and served really good canapes before dinner, and other guests were well behaved, a change from some I've been in where people attack the buffet as if they haven't eaten for a month.

A couple of minutes later one of the staff approached me with flyers about an upcoming festival and good spots I ought go to, to check the fireworks. This foreshadowed our stay at Hilton Tokyo. Everyone, without exception, went out of their way to help and serve. We had booked two rooms, a twin deluxe and a junior suite. The junior suite room was very spacious. The rooms were spotless and modernly furnished, and the bathroom was very clean. Both rooms and bathrooms were equipped with the usual essentials. I especially liked the fact that we each had a clean pajama that we could, not to mention Japanese Yukatas were available as well. We had fun taking photos posing in them. The breakfast buffet boasted a variety of western and Japanese style dishes. The Japanese vegetable curry was delicious. The hotel is well located atop Nishi-Shinjuku metro station. There are a couple of convenience stores behind the hotel. As for restaurants, there is a good number of establishments right next to the hotel. We never ran out of bottled water, after a long day of sightseeing we always came back home to find a couple of them supplied. I really can’t fault the hotel, as everything was up to par with Hilton standard. If I ever get the chance to travel to Tokyo again, I’d choose to stay here again. Oh, one more thing, the day we were supposed to leave for Osaka I asked the concierge if there are any lockers at the station that we could stash in one of our extra luggage (which happened to contain items from our shopping spree in Shibuya) the concierge asked me where would I be staying next and I said Hilton Osaka, and Hilton Odaiba after that, she then told me that instead they could send our luggage to our last hotel stay which is in Odaiba and we wouldn’t have to worry about it. I opted for that and they sent our luggage to Odaiba for around 1400 yen (if my memory serves me right).",5,2016/08/16

10 - 15 minutes walking distance to Shinjuku Station or Shinjuku shopping area. There is also regular hotel shuttle bus to Shinjuku Station back and forth. Very convenience for any travellers : solo, couples, family or business travellers.

The room is quite spacy compare to most hotels in Japan. Very cozy room, clean and very helpful staff. The breakfast was very good. This was my 2nd time, and still had best experience so far. Definitely will come again to this hotel.",5,2016/08/15
1,REDACTED,en,832,"My partner and I stayed in Hilton Tokyo for the first time in July for 4 nights. After a long 12 hr day of travel from Sydney, we arrived in the early evening to check in. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to an executive room (I'm hilton gold) and was looked after by Mr Ernesto at the front desk who was guest relations. Over the course of our stay he was fantastic in making us feel welcomed at home. The service and facilities were impeccable. Top notch stay and highly recommended!",5,2016/08/15
1,REDACTED,en,833,"We spent 5 nights here. It is hard to fault the hotel as it provides a typical Hilton experience which is always enhanced in Asia with the amazing helpful and gracious service. Rooms are very spacious by Japanese standards, extremely comfortable and subtly decorated. The concierge service is really, really good with lovely engaging and helpful staff. Breakfasts are always a treat with great choices for Western and Asian travelers. The foyer and lobby restaurant are always buzzing and are a local 'place to be' with weddings on weekends and high teas etc served in the afternoons. The pool, gym and spa are of high standard with a lovely Japanese bath which was quiet and relaxing. To be honest though, we would only stay here again if in Tokyo for holidays for the Hilton Honours extras or if there for business. Even though it is in Shinjuku, it is away from the sights and night life in the area although Shinjuku station is near. The location itself felt more business than fun and the hotel gets a little crazy with people there for weddings, restaurants etc which can be a little confronting as a staying guest. As I said up front, nothing at all wrong with it and many things right, but for the location and a more colorful experience I would probably look at different options in the price range next time. A call out to the concierge desk again however as they managed to get us into some pretty awesome restaurants at short notice. A note to first time travelers to Japan - the hotel to hotel luggage forwarding service between cities is extremely reasonable from a cost perspective and really efficient. It makes traveling hassle free. See separate review of the Hilton's Grill restaurant.",4,2016/08/14
1,REDACTED,en,834,"I was greeted very warmly by the staff at the checkin counter. After a few minutes of checking room availability, they came up with an upgrade to the executive floor for me which was very much appreciated. The room was about medium sized, very comfortable. The executive floor lounge was very nice, the main lounge was a bit crowded so they escorted me to the ""secret lounge"". It had a great view and very personalized service along with a nice variety of food and drinks. Much quiter atmosphere. 

The morning breakfast in the main lobby was very good and had a wide selection. There is also breakfast available up near the executive floor for a more quite morning.

I took the airport limousine shuttle bus from Haneda for about $10 or $20 USD, hassle free and quick. The hotel is about a 10-15 minute walk from Shinjuku Station which is the busiest train station in the world, I'm told. I can believe it!",4,2016/08/14
1,REDACTED,en,835,"Narita Limousine bus service starts and stops at this hotel located about 10 minutes from Shinjuku Station. Wonderfully maintained property with a perfectly gracious staff that can't seem to do enough for you. Had a bit of a hiccup with a dinner steak, but once Diego, Director F&B, got his hands on the situation all was good with the world.
Room,amentities and the entire facility are well maintained and thought out. Second floor dining area has been completely redone and is simply gorgeous. 
Keep up the wonderful work!!",5,2016/08/14
1,REDACTED,en,836,"This is the third time I stayed in Hilton Tokyo. I found that the executive level room was refreshed. This makes the hotel deserve its price. The staffs in reception are very friendly. But the service of shuttle bus drives are different. Some one are very friendly, others love to be COOL. The breakfast is perfect. They provide Japanese and Continental style food, you can choose what you want.",5,2016/08/14
1,REDACTED,en,837,The service was good but not great compared to the standard at other hotels in Japan. My room definitely could use a fresh coat of paint and the furniture was worn from the wear and tear. The bathroom could be cleaner as there were rust stains and some mildew in the grout of bathtub walls.,3,2016/08/13
1,REDACTED,en,838,Wonderful service culture at the hotel. Hotel has a highly professional team led by GM Michael Williamson . Noteworthy service by Ms Mary Onda at the executive lounge .

1,REDACTED,en,839,"I have stayed at lots of Hilton Hotels. This was by far the best experience at a Hilton hotel ever. The representative at the front desk check in was so personable and accommodating. She went out of her way to give my family the best vacation experience. The Jr Executive suite was wonderful and plesent surprise. It was the envy of all our friends and everyone commented on our facebook posts. The executive lounge was extremely clean, relaxing and well stocked with food and beverages. I wish I had reserved a longer stay. The location of the pool was perfect and it provided clean fun for the whole family. I love running in the park nearby and then working out with weights in the gym, it had ample equipment to meet all my needs. Finally, the breakfast was a decadent spread of various cuisines. I felt right at home with all the Asian and American comfort food (porridge, fish, omelette). The staff provided exceptional service. The service I received was unmatched by other Hiltons or any other hotel brand. I wish all my hotel experiences were as good as what I received at Hilton Tokyo. I especially love the fact that I didn't have to tip to get good service and or was expected to give a handout to get decent service. The staff at Hilton Tokyo took pride in providing top end service and it showed. Bravo to the entire team! The room was exceptionally clean and roomy. I appreciate that in a country where room size is a premium luxury, we were upgraded to the Jr. Executive Suite. Two large bathrooms, one with a jacuzzi tub and a full-size room with separate living room area for meetings and work. Not to mention walking distance to the executive lounge full of beverages, beer and snacks. I felt quite at home. Thank you Hilton Tokyo for the plush accommodations. I wish all my hotel stays can be like the experience I received at Hilton Tokyo. America has lots to learn about good service. A sincere thank you to all your staff for a great experience. We will definitely be back.",5,2016/08/12
1,REDACTED,en,840,"We landed around 9:30pm on a Tuesday in Late July. For the reason we didn't understand, Airport limousine shuttle could not stop in front of Hilton. So we needed to get a taxi from another hotel to get to Hilton. We unloaded 6 baggages on the sidewalk in front of Hilton around 11:30pm by ourselves. We were the only guests there. There were 2 hotel staffs at the porter booth, chatting and not looking up to give us eye contact for a few minutes. I finally walked up to ask them to help us with our luggages while we checked-in. One of them did. We were appalled by the rude and unhelpful attitude of the porter staff.

We are gold member and usually get upgrade and access to executive lounge. Since we had 3 people and required a rollaway bed. We were told there was not a big enough room for us on the executive level. Since our room will not be on executive level, we cannot access to executive lounge. This is the perk that we remain gold member for. It seems useless here at least for the first night. We came back to this hotel for 2 more nights after travelling to South. The second time, the front desk staff apologized for the inconvenience and waived the fees for the rollaway bed.

Our experience at this Hilton on our first night in Japan was not so good. However, the rest of our stay in this Hilton and other part of Japan was wonderful. Everyone was polite and helpful.",4,2016/08/11
1,REDACTED,en,841,"We enjoyed an absolutely fantastic 3 nights at this hotel.

Arrival was faultless, dropped off by the shuttle from Narita straight at the hotel where a porter dealt with our bags while we checked in. The lobby was busy but this didn't bother us, it wasn't overly so. We were checked in straight away and the staff spoke excellent English- I tried Japanese but honestly I'm pretty rubbish. It appeared there were many dual linguists among the staff members who we saw dealing with people from all over the world.

We stayed in a suite so we took the elevator up. The common spaces are fantastically looked after and clean. As was our room. It was spacious and had a sitting area, bathroom and shower and bath tub as well as tea and coffee making facilities and storage. The beds were extremely comfy and the amenities provided were second to none- even the shampoo, conditioner and shower gel were good brands that we were familiar with.

Being suite customers we had use of the top floor business lounge which was fabulous and an absolute treat. This also hosted breakfast and evening snacks including beverages- people were even drinking champagne at breakfast! It was great to be able to go up and grab a coffee or a cold drink during the summer heat. The staff were professional and friendly and the evening snacks were good, one night we had satay skewers which were good! 

We also had the buffet breakfast which was phenomenal, one of the absolute best we've had. Massive thank you and commendations to the Maitre'D who looked after us, whose name I unfortunately did not get but he was excellent with everyone (I think he's half Brazilian half Asian!). A real treat to speak to in the morning. As well as the egg chef who always had a great smile on his face. The selection is good- western items, hot items, cold items, an entire Japanese breakfast room, pastries etc. You could eat whatever you liked. There was also coffee, speciality coffee, juices/water, a selection of teas and a Nespresso machine for a great morning espresso. 

The hotel itself is a five minute walk down to Shinjuku, to the station and shops, from this hotel in the skyscraper district. It is a safe (well this is Japan, it feels pretty safe everywhere!) walk over to Shinjuku but if you wanted to go elsewhere there was direct access underground through the mall into the underground system. As a young female traveller I even made this walk alone a couple of times. It was great to be in the midst of everything, but to not have to deal with smaller rooms and louder neighbours of extremely centralised Shinjuku hotels. 

I was totally impressed by this hotel and the service was fabulous. I would without a shadow of a doubt choose this hotel for a further trip to Tokyo, in fact, this hotel was part of the reason we had such a great trip!",5,2016/08/11
1,REDACTED,en,842,We stayed a week family with 9 year old son and couldn't have had it more comfortable. The staff in all categories where so nice and helpful. We didn't enjoy the dinner but had breakfast which was fantastic. We also had access to the lounge on one of the top floors where we could enjoy amazing view and some snacks.,5,2016/08/10
1,REDACTED,en,843,"This hotel has far exceeded all of my expectations. Check-in was quick and easy. The elevator bank has six cars, so there is little waiting. My room was a queen, no smoking, room on the 24th floor near the ice machine (no noise issues with that). The room is very large by Japanese standards. The desk area is ample if one is here on business. The closet has 11 clothes hangers, an iron, ironing board, slippers, hair dryer and a safe. Each side of the bed has a small table, a table lamp, a reading lamp and an under-table night light. There is a chest that doubles as a luggage stand for a single suitcase with two very large drawers below. The top drawer had two robes that are replaced on a daily basis if used. I was most impressed by the window coverings. The room had a great view and large window. There was a sliding covering that was designed to look like traditional Japanese paper walls. It would let in some light. In addition there was a solid panel that could be slide over the first one giving the room almost a total blackout. I have never seen this before but, having now seen it, can’t imagine why all hotels in the world don’t have it, especially ones near the Arctic and Antarctic Circles. The bed was comfortable and came with four pillows – two soft and two firm. When I booked I’d ordered two other pillows that were not present when I arrived at my room. I told the front desk about it the next day and they were promptly delivered. The TV was fine, though not a lot of English programing and the only English news channel is BBC. The mini bar was well stocked with beverages and a few snacks. There were two complimentary bottles of water and plenty of free tea and instant coffee. There was an electric kettle and a small tea service complete with a tea pot and Japanese tea cups. The bathroom was very nice with plenty of vanity space around the sink. It had large, thick, bath towels, hand towels and wash cloths. There was a decent sized bar of hand soap at the sink and a bottle of shower gel for the bath. There were also containers of shampoo, conditioner and body lotion in addition to a shower cap. The tub was large and deep with a grab bar to aid in a safe entrance and exit. The shower felt very forceful. There wasn’t an exhaust fan but the mirror was heated, so didn’t fog up. The vanity was very well lit and there was a large magnifying make-up mirror mounted to the wall on the right of the sink. The toilet was outfitted with a Japanese washing toilet seat. The hotel is close to a subway line and there is a free shuttle that runs three times an hour to and from the Shinjuku Station. I will definitely stay here again.

1,REDACTED,en,844,"the Tokyo hilton is simply one of the best hotels in Tokyo. the facilities, staff and severe are all first rate. Its easy to get to and very importantly taxi drivers can understand ""hilton shinjuku"" without me embarrassing myself too much.
Gym and pool on site, restaurants and bars are well positioned and cover a full spectrum. Of course, this is tokyo, so you have to get out and see the city. The Hilton is walking distance to Shinjuku, one of the worlds greatest shopping areas, the train station allows access to anywhere in the vastness of the metropolis and again its easy to find your way back again.

1,REDACTED,en,850,"This hotel is well situated in Shinjuku with easy access to the subway without even leaving the building. Plenty of parks, restaurants and shops nearby making it suitable for a broad range of travelers. 
As you would expect in
Tokyo, the rooms are small. Traveling with a 5yo, we were all able to sleep in the same king bed but after a week we were craving more space. However, we were out exploring most days so it suited our needs. 
Hotel staff generally speak English to a high standard which helped with our queries and service needs. 
The lobby restaurant serves an excellent breakfast albeit very expensive. The dinner buffet wasn't quite up to the same standard and more variety would have been appreciated. The desserts, however, are a highlight with some incredible and creative treats. One evening we had a table that was more of a lounge set up and right next to the open lobby which made dining slightly uncomfortable physically and mentally. Ask for a table towards the back of the room. 
Fittings, furnishings and facilities were to the normally high standard you would expect from Hilton. My only gripe would be that as a older building the rooms are not fitted with usb chargers which means overseas travelers will need to rely on power adapters.

Mine was a work trip but I had a day to myself and the concierge provided good advice on walking around and transport. Hotel itself is huge and the only negative is crowd control - the lines for reception and for the elevators can get busy. The rooms are an excellent mix of Japanese and western.

The Exec Junior Suite has a nice large sitting area, large L-shape sofa, comfortable enough for a teenager to sleep on. Extra bedding and pillows were brought to us without charge. 

There is a fridge with mini bar, a nespresso coffee maker and tea kettle for us tea drinkers. Bottled water is complementary and you are welcome to get more from the concierge on your way out the door.

The concierge is so helpful from shuttles to bus limos to train routings and directions. They literally plan our day for us on short notice - thank you Marina!

Also, you also get free access to the exec lounge breakfast, tea and pre dinner drinks are complementary to staying guests of the exec suites. Breakfast included eggs, ham, bacon, smoked salmon, fresh fruits yogurt, muesli, granola in additional to the typical continental fare. Tea included mini cakes and scones, etc. we did not make it to the pre dinner drink.

There's also a 24-hr convenience store at the hotel in the basement floor.

They had pretty much everything you could think of: cakes, muffins, cookies, ice cream, waffles, shakes, trifles, macarons.. everything.

As long as you are on the high floors (as we were), you will enjoy great views of bustling Tokyo. And if that is not enough, Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, which has free observatory decks, is a block away. 

As expected, the Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku has nicely-appointed common areas and clean bedrooms. Not expected was the size of the bedrooms which are much larger than what you would expect in Tokyo (even at other western hotels in the city).

Breakfast was excellent, with a wide range of western and Japanese items. The hotel does have an executive lounge, with drinks and appetizers in the evening.

Since it is a large and busy hotel, it can seem seems understaffed. The wait for the check in or to talk with a concierge can be excruciatingly long.

Lots of restaurants all around the ares. Highlight is definitely the breakfast buffet! WOW! What a selection of food - western and Asian. Enough food to not need anything to eat for most of the day.

1,REDACTED,en,872,"I don't have a single complaint -- because of my work, I ended up having to do room service quite a bit, not able to get out much -- and everyone who assisted me was beyond helpful! Naturally the room service prices were pricey -- this is a 5-star hotel in Tokyo -- I didn't expect anything less to be honest.

The beds are incredibly comfortable and the bathroom has enough space to get ready in the morning.

I took the Airport Limousine Bus to & from Narita Airport. On the way there, my flight landed to late to be dropped off at the hotel. So I had to go to Shinjuku Station and walk (half a mile maybe?) to the hotel - not too bad.

1,REDACTED,en,877,"Stayed at a junior suite at Hilton Tokyo for a family vacation with our two adult-sized teenagers. The hotel was chosen mainly due to its central location and the room size that appeared to be sufficient for the four of us. The room had a king size bed and we asked for a roll away bed which was twin-size at no extra cost. The room also had a modular sofa and was large enough to lay open our four suitcases. 

One slight issue was with the size of the bathroom. There was not much counter space, and I never understood when hotels choose to use a piece of glass that covers less than half the shower instead of a shower curtain or other means to block water. The obvious result was the wet bathroom floor. Other than that, it meets all our travel needs. There was a convenient store in the basement that opened 24 hours; it was (strangely) a hit for our kids and the items appeared to be regularly priced.

The hotel is close to Nishi Shinjuku and Tochomae subway stations (short walking distances). Shinjuku (different from Nishi Shinjuku) is the main station there and the hotel has free shuttle services every 20 minutes (schedule available in the lobby). We walked back from the station once; there was an underground tunnel which became quite confusing for us so it turned out to be a challenge especially after a long day of walking already. I therefore recommend the shuttle service which we utilized several times; it was NEVER late which was impressive. In case one wishes to use the shuttle from the Shinjuku station to the hotel for the first time: It stops at Stop 21 (there is a sign) which is between the west and the south exits of the Shinjuku station, in front of the Keio department store. The bus has room for luggage.

We arrived in Japan via Haneda Airport and didn't have any problems getting Airport Limousine tickets at the airport after getting off the airplane, and Hilton is one of the stops for the Shinjuku line. We left from Narita; the Airport Limousine tickets could be purchased at Hilton but the one we wanted to book was sold out the night before. We ended up taking the JR Narita Express train which cost almost the same. The train leaves from the building across from the south exit of the Shinjuku station. It is a shorter ride than the bus but do take into consideration the extra time needed to get from the hotel to the station.",4,2016/07/25
1,REDACTED,en,878,"This Hilton is awesome. Spent 4 nights here with my sister. She loves it too. As a Diamond member, I was upgraded to twin junior suite. The room is spacious but the bathroom is small and awkward design. However, the bathroom is still very beautiful. The bed is very comfortable. You definitely need it after long walks everyday in Tokyo. 

The breakfast is fantastic. We can choose 1st, 2nd or lounge to enjoy our breakfast. Selections of foods are good. Very fresh and delicious.

This will be my 1st choice stay in Tokyo if I want a luxury hotel. Highly recommended!!",5,2016/07/25
1,REDACTED,en,879,"Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku is a Category 7 Hilton property located in the heart of Tokyo, just about 1 km from Shinjuku railway station. The Airport Limousine Bus stops right outside the door of the hotel and is a very convenient, hassle free way to get to this hotel from both Narita & Haneda International Airport. The hotel also provides a very frequent shuttle service to Shinjuku station. The hotel is also right next to Nishi Shinjuku subway station on Marunouchi line. On top of everything, the hotel is steps away from a Dennys restaurant (not that you should be eating that food when you are in Japan!! :)).

A free night at this hotel costs 30,000 - 60,000 Hilton HHonors points depending on the season. We stayed here for 3 nights @ 50,000 Hilton HHonors points/night.

We arrived late night around 11 PM and the front desk area was pretty busy. The front desk agent was very helpful and gave some helpful tips regarding our stay. Since we both have elite status in Hilton (wife is Diamond and I am Gold), we got to enjoy complimentary breakfast throughout our stay.

For our daily complimentary breakfast we went to the Tsunohazu restaurant. There were both Western and Japanese style breakfast items available. I would rate the selection and quality as pretty high for the breakfast buffet. There was one room dedicated to Japanese breakfast items and remaining tables had western selections including ""made to order eggs"" by chef.

We also had access to the Executive lounge at the hotel. The lounge hosted both a evening tea hour (with some light snacks) and a cocktail hour later where they served both cold and hot appetizers.

The Executive lounge also had a Business center inside which we used to print our boarding passes for upcoming trip.

Thumbs up:

Excellent location in Shinjuku area close to Shinjuku station and Nishi Shinjuku subway stop
Shuttle to Shinjuku station thrice/hour
Excellent breakfast buffet at the restaurant and pretty good spread at the Executive Lounge in the evening

Thumbs down:

Not cheap on points with 50,000 HHonors points/night

1,REDACTED,en,880,"After three weeks in Japan at Sheraton/Westin Hotels, this Hilton was a breath of fresh air. Great checkin (including online room selection via an app). Extra bedding for kids and use of pool, and breakfast was included (extra at all others), there were only friendly signed (all other hotels had a lot of ""do not"" signed on everything!). The staff all engaged with the customers. Great hotel.",5,2016/07/24
1,REDACTED,en,881,"We selected the Hilton Tokyo primarily as I am a Diamond Honors level, and they allowed 4 people in a single room. As others have mentioned, that is not always allowed in Japan, as we found out when planning this vacation. 

We received a room upgrade and access to their Honors breakfast buffet. We were so full from breakfast, we typically skipped lunch. Quality and variety was very good.
Tip: the 2nd floor location seemed to have the same variety as the 1st floor, but without the crowds. The 2nd floor was for Honors members only.

Location: Great base location for exploring Tokyo, as there are two subway stations connected to the hotel via and underground walkway (Nishi-Shinjuku and Tochomae). We started all our travel from these stations, and not the main Shinjuku station, which is huge.

TIP: when arriving in Tokyo at Tokyo station, the hotel recommended taking the subway to Shinjuku station, and then catching their hotel shuttle to the hotel. I would recommend another option. We took the subway to Nishi-Shinjuku station and walked about 5 minutes to the hotel via the underground walkway. Unless you are familiar with Shinjuku station, it will take you twice as long just to find the location of the hotel shuttle. Also, the hotel shuttle runs every 20 minutes, so you could be waiting a while.

The hotel seemed pretty crowded, but the level of service did not suffer. The main desk and concierge desk were very efficient and helpful. The only minor complaint was that in the mornings, the elevators were crowded bringing people down, and sometimes we had to wait for the next one. This is not uncommon in large multistory hotels. 

The room was clean and stylish. The bathroom and shower were excellent. The AC worked very well, considering the 95 degree F temperatures during our stay.

Overall a great hotel that contributed to an excellent family vacation in Tokyo. I highly recommend.",5,2016/07/24
1,REDACTED,en,882,"As someone who once worked in the hospitality industry, I am very picky when it comes to hotels. However, on my second trip to Tokyo, I stayed in the renovated executive floor room. This room had a japanese style and the bed and bathroom designs were perfect. I also had access to the Executive lounge, which is located in the top floor, and had a great experience there with the staff. (Hint: you can also see Mt. Fuji from the lounge on a clear day) 

Overall, location was just a 10 min walk to the heart of Shinjuku and the staff were great!",5,2016/07/24
1,REDACTED,en,883,"We, couple and 9 years old child, had a great stay in this excellent hotel. The staff was really helpful and polite. The location was really close to Shinjuku with restaurants and shopping. It was very easy to get subway to all places in Tokyo. It was very good breakfast and service top class. Very nice indoor swimmingpool (maybe a little bit small). We had a junior suite with access to executive lounge and children is/was allowed. We booked at Hilton website in advance and therefore a little discount in a nice room with view. We will definitive choose this hotel again next time in Tokyo!!",5,2016/07/24
1,REDACTED,en,884,"Travelling with children over Japan, it was difficult to find hotels that could take 4 of us in a room. And when we could find a hotel room that would take 4, they were usually very pricey as the room rate is charged on a per person basis. The Hilton Shinjuku was no exception, it was quite pricey, but we chose it because it had a hotel shuttle that would drop and pick you by Shinjukuku Station. We had booked a junior suite. When we arrived to checkin, they offered us an upgrade to a club room which was a bigger suite that included a seperate bedroom and living room, and access to the club lounge for breakfast and canapes. It was going to cost extra, but decided to go for it. The room was amazing, and so big. Bed was so comfortable. Kids had roll aways to sleep on, and they said they were very comfortable. We had a view of Mt Fuji, and fantastic views across Tokyo. We really enjoyed the buffet breakfast in the lobby, and enjoyed the canapes at night in the club lounge. The shuttle to Shinjuku was very reliable. The only let down was when we tried to book a transfer (airport service) to Haneda airport for our flight to Sapporo the guy at the transfer desk told us it was alredy booked out. Friends of ours that were also staying at the hotel were told to book when they checked in, it would have been good if we were also told, so that we could all get to the airport together. In the end we took a cab, which turned out fine, as it was a Saturday morning and the traffic was not too bad. The cab to Haneda was about 8000 yen. Would really recommend this hotel, although it is not a cheap stay, it is nice to have a bit of luxury to come back to after hitting the streets of Tokyo. An amazing hotel in an amazing city, can't wait to go back.",4,2016/07/23
1,REDACTED,en,885,Thoroughly enjoyed this great hotel. Shinjuku is a great location to tackle Tokyo. Was upgraded to Jr. Executive king suite. The hotel is modern and well maintained.

1,REDACTED,en,886,"This was my first time to Japan. What a great experience! We (myself, my husband and teenage son) stayed here for 4 nights, and then had to leave for Niigata (my husband had business). We were in Niigata for two nights, before having to come back to Tokyo and fly home the next day. We were scheduled to stay in a hotel near the airport, but we loved the Tokyo Hilton so much that we canceled that reservation and came back to Shinjuku to stay at this Hilton one last night. The staff were so friendly and accommodating, the hotel is beautiful, the beds are comfortable, the food is wonderful. The hotel even smells wonderful! I only wish I would have bought some of the spray that they use so I could have it home to remind me of Tokyo and our stay here. The Hilton also has a shuttle that runs every 20 minutes that goes to and from the Shinjuku train station, where you can either catch the train or wonder the neon streets. It is in a great location, many other restaurants in the area if you would like to eat elsewhere or explore. This hotel is very welcoming, the concierge is very helpful and friendly, as well. If you need internet, it is free with your room. We just really enjoyed our stay here and will definitely stay here the next time we are in Tokyo.",5,2016/07/23

I have stay in many Tokyo hotels, Hilton Tokyo is always my first choice.",5,2016/07/21
1,REDACTED,en,893,"I've stayed here twice now and had excellent experiences both times. The staff - from pre-arrival communication for transportation and arrangements to arrival, stay and departure - are first rate and always helpful.

If arriving by air, there is a bus (Airport Limousine - orange buses) that will take you direct for about 3100 yen. It can take 90-120 minutes though with traffic and several stops, but it does take you directly to the hotel. Otherwise, you can take the Narita Express train to Shinjuku station and the a cab to the hotel and save some time, but have to transfer to taxi. 

The rooms are clean and basic. I was upgraded to a suite the first trip that had a living room and bedroom and then upgraded to a ""deluxe"" room the second time that was a more traditional room with two twin beds. Both were clean and well appointed. 

As an HHonors member I had access to the lounge on the 37th floor. The staff is very helpful and can help with reservations or any questions about the hotel or Tokyo. The breakfast is very nice as is the evening reception. It can get crowded on the weekends, but they do a good job seating people - it is rather large. You can get a nice table or couch by the window for views of Tokyo.

The restaurant ""floor"" has several restaurants and a nice bar with evening specials. There is a single check in counter that serves them all. But make reservations as they can fill up quickly. 

Concierge was always helpful and took care of my return reservation for the airport as well as quickly gathering and returning laundry. 

It's also conveniently located in the Shinjuku area about a block from the subway, Government center and local restaurants and shops.

This is my go to stop for lodging in Tokyo",5,2016/07/20

1,REDACTED,en,895,"The facilities at this hotel is as one would expect from hotels in this category and price range. However, it is the business lounge staff that makes this hotel so special. The business lounge could be at times crowded and somehow Kuranami-san and her colleagues understood my predilections for quietness after hectic day and steered us to a quiet place. The lounge staff also heard that it was my wife birthday and they brought a birthdy cake and came to wish her happy birthday on short notice.
It is the little attention like this that makes this Hilton so special and our 4 weeks stay so pleasurable!
One the minus side, I find having to renew the wi-fi subscription every day a nuisance specially when you are on extended stay.",4,2016/07/19
1,REDACTED,en,896,"We had an amazing stay at Hilton Tokyo. Our Executive room had very beautiful Japanese designs in it, from the wooden windows to Japanese calligraphy on the carpet. The Executive Lounge offered a lovely view of Tokyo’s skyline and the mini sweet and savory bites served to us were simply oishi. Hilton Tokyo is also conveniently located near major departmental stores and a whole host of restaurants and eateries. Customer service was top class throughout our stay, as expected of Japanese service standards.",5,2016/07/18
1,REDACTED,en,897,"I was looking for a hotel which could fit 3 people in a room. Found that Hilton Tokyo can accommodate 3 people and still have room for the luggage. Room was big and we were comfortable even if we were 3. Check-in was quick and reception people were really nice and very professional. You wont have to wait long for an elevator since there are 6 I believe and were really fast. 

Rooms were really clean and beds were comfortable. Bathroom was clean as well and stocked up with amenities. 

There's a free Hilton shuttle bus from hotel to Shinjuku Station in front of Keio Department Store which is pretty convenient. It leaves every 15 minutes. 

I would definitely stay here again. I would recommend this if you want to be in a quiet area away from the hustle and bustle but can easily get to the shopping area of Shinjuku if you feel like going. 

Good Job Hilton for making our stay comfortable and convenient.",4,2016/07/18
1,REDACTED,en,898,"Due to the location it's always filled with tourists and people who are briefly stopping over on the way to somewhere else. I do like the atmosphere but it's not exactly relaxing mood if that's what you are looking for.

For dinner we ate at dynasty (superb meals although somewhat slow service. But this was during 3-day long holidays) and I do recommend the place to everyone especially if you wanna try good Chinese food. 

Restaurants are only on 2nd floor and that's one of the drawbacks of staying at this hotel.. Even though the building itself is pretty tall you don't get to enjoy the view unless you stay at higher floor. 

On the first floor there's the breakfast place (buffet style) and it's open 6:30-11. My grandma and I went there around 10 and it was packed. The usher walked too fast for my grandma so we lost him shortly, and he noticed afterwards and came back for us, but that wasn't exactly what I expect from hilton.",4,2016/07/17

1,REDACTED,en,900,"We had a recent two-night stopover in Tokyo so this hotel was perfect for us. The 'Limousine Bus' service from Narita airport was so convenient and inexpensive and it dropped us right outside the hotel. The trip takes about 1.5hours. We had the option of the Narita Express train but the thought of navigating our way through Shinjuku with all our luggage meant the bus was a far better option. 
I'm sure this must be one of Hilton's signature hotels. It has a commanding presence on the street with a grand lobby entrance. It is located a short walk from central Shinjuku - probably about 20 minutes. We stayed in an Executive Deluxe King, which included access to the Executive lounge on level 37. The room was a decent size by Tokyo standards with a bathroom with separate bath and shower, however, the design could have been better as most of the water from the shower ends up missing you and falls in the bath. Of course, we all love Japanese toilets - so high tech. A higher floor would have been a bonus given the fantastic views over Tokyo the higher up you are. We could see Mount Fuji in the distance from the Executive lounge on level 37. 
Concierge were out best friends here - the staff were superb. They had recommended an excellent, affordable sushi restaurant even before we arrived. They also recommended a 24-hour metro pass that we could buy directly from the hotel for 8000 Yen (normally 10000 Yen). The subway system was easy to navigate. All their advice made our short stay so efficient and hassle-free. 
I thought breakfast in the lounge was fairly standard. The hot breakfast options were limited and didn't look that appealing. I did love the fresh orange juice machine. Evening drinks and canapes were excellent. 
I would definitely stay here again. It was comfortable, made our short visit so easy, and is not as pricey as some of the other chain hotels (it's not exactly a bargain though). Note to self and others - next time book direct as WIFI is an extra charge if you book through a third party e.g. travel agent or booking website.",5,2016/07/16

1,REDACTED,en,902,"We enjoyed every aspect of our stay here. Everyone we interacted with went above and beyond to make everything perfect (to the extent that people would see us heading to the elevator bank and rush over to push buttons for us). We stayed in a king deluxe room which was spacious compared to other hotels we stayed in while in Japan. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the blackout sliders worked super well and we didn't hear a single noise during our stay (a wonderful bonus if you're jet lagged). Also appreciated the free bottled water in the room that was replaced daily as it was warm during our stay.

Breakfast was very nice with three full sections: Japanese (including a custom omelet station), European and American. The American section was a little atypical for breakfast (ex: steamed broccoli, baked beans) but everything else was really nice. As HHonors members (free to sign up), you get to eat breakfast on the second floor where the selection is the same as the larger buffet downstairs but it's much quieter and the ratio of staff to guests is way better.

Loved that the hotel has its own subway entrance. It made getting around the city a breeze. The food selections around the hotel are not as plentiful as in other areas so we typically ate dinner before coming back at night. We did stay out late a couple of nights and had no problem getting back to the hotel via the subway even with the limited schedule. Wish we had it so good back at home!

The next time we're back in Tokyo, we will definitely stay here again.",5,2016/07/13

We toured with Emiko tour guide and she was great. It was a walking tour and we would leave from our hotel each morning and take the subway and walk. The hotel has a really nice breakfast buffet. It also has a sufficient workout facility. A few machines, some free weights, bikes and treadmills. The staff was very nice. One of my children left an important charger in the room after checkout. Via email, I inquired and they found it. They mailed it to our destination in Hong Kong and only charged postage. I was very impressed. Very nice hotel and staff in a good area.",4,2016/07/13

The rooms are massive by Tokyo standards, we were quite shocked when we opened the door. The view over the city was lovely as well. The location isn't as central as other hotels in terms of nightlife or restaurants but it is only a short walk to the metro and I prefer the quieter location.

The hotel itself is nice, and what you'd expect from a Hilton in a major urban centre - clean, decently-sized rooms. No ""wow"" factor, but reliable, comfortable and worthwhile.

The distance from the station makes me a little leery about staying here again - I'd prefer something more convenient. But if that's not a factor for you, it's a great place to stay.",4,2016/07/13

1,REDACTED,en,907,The Hilton Tokyo turned out to be a great choice for our stay in Tokyo. We arrived by subway to the Nishi-Shinjuku station and then walked just a few minutes to the hotel. The hotel is very convenient to the subway stations and has a bus that runs every 20 minutes to and from the Shinjuku train station. Upon arrival we were checked in by Albert Ferre Contreras. We are Hilton Honors Gold members and he went out of his way to make sure we received an upgrade from a Jr. Suite to an Executive Suite with Executive Lounge privileges. This turned out to be a fantastic upgrade and my family really enjoyed this. I want to thank him for making our stay so special. The hotel and rooms were immaculately clean. The executive lounge had a nightly cocktail reception which was great after a long trip from Hawaii. The breakfast in the morning featured a large selection with Japanese and Western offerings. There was an omelet station which was nice. The breakfast restaurant on the second floor was quiet and I think the best choice since the executive lounge only had a light breakfast. Waki was our waiter for several days offered us his daily recommendations of what to do and where to go in Tokyo. He also made our stay very special. The shuttle bus runs to Shinjuku station every 20 minutes and is very convenient. We were always able to get seats on the bus. Tokyo was such a blast we are planning our next trip already and will definitely stay at the Tokyo Hilton!,5,2016/07/12

1,REDACTED,en,910,"Tried the Hilton Tokyo instead of my usual Century Southern Tower as I am an HHonors members and as the hotel has a full gym and pool and better facilities. The gym is well equipped by Tokyo standards, the pool is small and short but usable and there is a Japanese bath area in the change room. 

The hotel is about 10 to 15 minutes walk from Shinjuku station depending how fast you walk. There is a shuttle running every 20 minutes between the hotel and Shinjuku station which is a nice convenience when you are trying to get from Shinjuku station or to the station from the hotel with your luggage on check in and check out. I usually take the Narita Express to Shinjuku station which is much faster and more convenient than the Limousine Bus if you can handle your own luggage and with the Century Southern Tower, would have rolled my luggage over to the hotel but with the Hilton, had to wait for the shuttle due to the distance to the hotel. The shuttle runs until 8 or 9 at night and starts early morning. 

Rooms are fairly large by Tokyo standards, as is the size of the washroom. Bed is comfortable. Air conditioning is fantastic, which really helped as Tokyo was in a heat wave with temperatures in the 30s Celsius. Japanese hotels tend to set the air con at 24 Celsius or so and therefore it was refreshing to have a hotel that does not reset to the higher temperature and that also can blast truly cold air con. The window had a sliding shoji screen type covering as well as full sliding wall type covering to block out both the light and heat of the sun. While there was lots of room in the hotel room and a nice chair in the corner, what was missing was a little side table or something on which one could rest a drink or some snacks while sitting back to watch TV. Lots of channels on the TV including several English language news, movie and entertainment channels. 

Service is polite and friendly as is typical with the Japanese. I did have some problems with an in-room safe that was not working that took several reports to housekeeping and reception to finally get fixed. They fixed it twice but each time, it only worked once before being locked and unable to be opened again. I think language was a problem with some staff except the concierge and front desk staff as the person sent to fix my in room safe indicated in broken language after fixing the safe that it was not reliable to use and then carried in a smaller portable safe that weighed maybe 15 lbs or so which he suggested I use instead. I then went to reception and explained to a very helpful Mr. Hiroyuki Ohashi, the front desk shift leader for the evening, the humour of leaving me a portable safe and, notwithstanding I said it was no longer important as I had only one more night to stay at the hotel, Mr. Ohashi very efficiently arranged for the safe to be fixed properly on the third try and in addition advised the Executive Housekeeper Takao Kuroda who left me a very nice letter apologizing for the problems with the safe and also complimentary wine and chocolates.

I had the buffet breakfast in the lobby restaurant each day as it was included in my rate. There was a very large selection of food, an omelet station, the usual bacon, eggs, sausages, some Japanese breakfast foods including one grilled fish item per day, and one Chinese item per day (shrimp dumpling, then pork siu mai and then sweet buns for the 3 days I was there). The breakfast restaurant can be very busy on the weekend with a bit of waiting to be seated even at around 8 am in the morning. A bit disappointed though the coffee tends to be American Starbucks strong and bitter but without much taste, as generally Tokyo restaurants and hotels serve really good tasting coffee as the Japanese are pickier and willing to pay more for coffee beans than other nations. 

Clientele is very international at the Hilton Tokyo with lots of business people but also lots of families and international vacationers. The hotels seems very busy at all times and seems quite full. 

Overall a good hotel with great facilities but a bit far in terms of walking distance to Shinjuku station if you are more of a leisure traveller rather than business traveller. I noticed in walking to Shinjuku station that I passed the well known Keio Plaza Hotel on the way and that it is several blocks closer to the station.",4,2016/07/11
1,REDACTED,en,911,"We booked the Executive King JR suite and were upgraded to the King Tower Suite (we were told room 3801 was their biggest room) - it offered amazing view of Tokyo and Mt Fuji is visible from the room on a clear day - just stunning! We were given early access to our room which was very nice (check-in time is 3pm) Both suites provide guests with complimentary access to the Executive Lounge which provided good breakfast, afternoon and evening drinks. We mainly used it for breakfast. The room was well appointed with a spa bath tub and Peter Thomas Roth amenities (similar to other Hilton's around the world), water bottles, tea, Nespresso coffee machine and a well stocked mini bar but did not use as the Executive Lounge is just downstairs. In-room dining was quick and nice (standard international pricing for in-room dining including service fee so not cheap but very convenient especially when the kids are exhausted from a long trip to Hakone). Buffet dinner was in the form of a lounge setting and atmosphere so very comfortable. The variety of food is not as extensive as you would expect from an international hotel but it was enough for us. It did however have an impressive Alice in Wonderland dessert spread. The staff, from the front desk to the housekeeper, were excellent. The female staff in the executive lounge were friendly and welcoming. The hotel also offer a well equipped gym (we did not use the gym but can view it from the swimming pool - which is a reasonable size pool but not large). Whilst the hotel is walkable to Shinjuku station, there is a complimentary bus every 20 mins to and from the hotel so makes the visit to Shinjuku station very convenient. Unlike the Four Seasons in Marounouchi, Hilton Tokyo does not have a stroller to borrow (something that they can consider). Overall a very pleasant stay at the Hilton Tokyo and we will certainly return if visiting Shinjuku.",5,2016/07/11
1,REDACTED,en,912,Great location. Great staff and many restaurants to choose from. It's a bit expensive but there are many different and cheaper options downstairs where it's connected to a shopping arcade..Close to the train station.,5,2016/07/11
1,REDACTED,en,913,"The hotel is well located near Shinjuku Station, so coming from Kyoto is easy. We caught the bullet train to Shinagawa and transferred to the Yamanote line to Shinjuku. We then walked the 10 minutes to the hotel. it was an easy walk, even with luggage and most of it is undercover so it is manageable also in wet weather. The hotel is very busy and relatively impersonal but there are a number of very good restaurants (which we enjoyed), There is an arcade of shops underneath the hotel, if you are so inclined. We had a junior suite, chosen because our 21 year old daughter was traveling with us. An extra bed was added to the room. Even with three adults we had LOTS of room, including a desk, lounge and chairs. We were very comfortable and had ample room for all our luggage - we were not falling over the top of each other trying to move around. The wi fi is very good, although the room is short of powerpoints for charging multiple smart phones, laptops etc. Complimentary water is provided each day also. The breakfast spread is very good. The airport limousine bus service stops at the hotel so departure to Haneda or Narita is convenient, if you do not wish to juggle luggage on the airport train (so lots of options for getting to and from this hotel). The hotel is very conveniently located - its strong point. The only reason I gave this hotel four rather than five 'circles' for its rating is that the room, whilst spacious, clean and functional, is looking a bit tired and old fashioned, as were the corridors. At times, you may have to wait a while for the lifts, Having said this, these are not 'deal breakers' and I would happily stay here again, It is a great spot for getting around Tokyo.",4,2016/07/11
1,REDACTED,en,914,Stayed 3 nights. Staff were very polite and helpful. Everything worked fine. Room was of decent size for 3 of us though it was a little tight for 3 large suitcases. Shuttle to Shinjuku was convenient and so was getting to and from the airport via the limousine bus. Short walk to the Nishi-Shinjuku subway station. Starbucks just around the corner was good as our room did not include breakfast.,5,2016/07/11
1,REDACTED,en,915,great hotel. convenient to everything. connected to metro. excellent staff. very helpful. wonderful experience staying here. would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Tokyo. Hilton hotels can be expected to provide an excellent level of service world wide.,5,2016/07/11
1,REDACTED,en,916,"We come here with a big family, 5 adults and 3 children, using 2 rooms and its still have a space to put luggage, stroller and others. Concierge is very helpful when you ask about how to get to one and another place, they will provide with map. And there is shuttle from 8 to 9 every 20minutes, its very helpful because its far walking to shinjuku from hotel. Even if you didnt get the last shuttle, you can use metro, its near hotel, Last, when we go to fuji we can put luggage there so we didnt need to bring a lot of luggage to fuji. Overall its nice to be there. Oh and a plus, we choose to be here not because of the space only, there is bus to airport from or to airport, from hotel just need to book 1 day before",5,2016/07/10
1,REDACTED,en,917,As expected with a Hilton very classy and nice. As with a lot of up market things in Japan the pricing is up there. The bar was nice all be it the service was a little slow at times. The room was very comfortable. The staff where very accommodating and a good level of English as a tourist in a non English country.,4,2016/07/10
1,REDACTED,en,918,"For the hotel, I give it five out of five. The rooms were very clean. There were a couple tv channels in English. If you are an hhonors member and get an upgraded room, the executive lounge is actually one of the better I've seen; Japanese beer, and Heineken. Also the complimentary breakfast in the lounge is great.

The hotel offers a shuttle to and from the Shinjuku station. There is some shopping at the station as well, but overall the area seemed a little boring. 

The hotel is a couple different bars, but a 23oz beer is $19.",5,2016/07/10
1,REDACTED,en,919,My daughter and I stayed at the Tokyo Hilton for a few nights on the way to Hong Kong. The staff could not have been nicer and more helpful. They were beyond friendly and went out of their way to make our stay wonderful. Ernesto was outstanding and set the tone for the entire staff. We will definitely stay here again when we are in Tokyo.,5,2016/07/09
1,REDACTED,en,920,Good property...excellent staff n service with thence prion of one single shuttle bus driver. Location is not perfect if you need to be in middle of action but the hotel shuttle to Shinjuku is punctual every 20 mins! Location is perfect if one needs the quiet with a beautiful park; couple of cafes including Starbucks and supermarts nearby. Pricing for coffee lounge n bar needs to be more competitive!,4,2016/07/08
1,REDACTED,en,921,"stayed on hhonors points. got room upgrade and executive longe access. room was very attractive and well layed out, though on the small side hotel restaurants are prohibitively expensive.the free breakfast was good. not a great location for tourists but close to transportation. a very good experince all around",4,2016/07/08
1,REDACTED,en,922,This hotel is conveniently located. The rooms are spacious! Staff super friendly and helpful! Special thanks to Ernesto! He made us feel at home. The breakfast is a must have. Train station near by. Lots to see within walking distance.,5,2016/07/08
1,REDACTED,en,923,Never stayed at a hotel that took so long to clean rooms for guests staying there. Each day it was after 2:30 and then they forgot to leave towels one day. Hotel is okay but not a place I will stay again.,3,2016/07/07
1,REDACTED,en,924,"We stayed at a 5 star hotel prior to our 2 nights here- said to be one of the best in the world- but we enjoyed our stay, here, the most. Staff was wonderful, our room was so relaxing. They also bumped our room up to a bigger one at no extra charge and had some upgrade that gave us access to an upstairs breakfast buffet that was very good while small and quiet. Only hint- if you get hungry later in the evening and want to get appetizers in the comfy looking restaurant- the price is not worth it. Other than that, definitely stay here!!!!",5,2016/07/07
1,REDACTED,en,925,"No lobby that could be used for general purposes. In order to use lobby, you had to order food or drinks. This was not convenient. The hotel was located on top of a shopping center. The center did not have any quality shops. The rooms were decent sized and well-maintained, however, the cost associated with the property left a lot of room for improvement. Shuttle service to the shopping area was convenient. If I visit Tokyo again, I will stay somewhere else.",2,2016/07/07
1,REDACTED,en,926,"I've stayed here for 5 nights with my sister family and my parents, so we booked 3 rooms. 
From the start we arrieved at the airport, we have ordered small mini bus from hilton and it can fit 9 peoples with 13 big suitcases. He picked me up exactly in front of the pick up area door.
I have many emails to them months before i took off to japan, they always quick respond with direct answer. 
The reception can speak fluent and clear english and give me a lot of information and even they afford to change my room as i requested. 
The room pretty big (for hotel in tokyo), i syated with 2 small kids (6 &7) and my wife so we add additional extra bed. The bed was queen size more or less 150x200cm. The room was clean and neat as i expected. The pillow was excellent but not all some of it. The soap at shower smell good.
Location hotel was perfect if you want to get close to shinjuku area but you don't want the crowd hotel ( this hotel is crowd but i've seen worse in shinjuku). I had stayed hotel close to hilton and the hotel was full of toer buses and que check in and check out and also que for breakfast can be wait for 30-60 minutes every breakfast. The service also bad, because the hotel too crowded and not enough people to take care your problem.

Inside, the hotel hilton have their own access to train line.
Breakfast was standard as 5 stars hotel, for 5 nights kind a boring because not much of combination of food but the taste was good, the most i love was baked fish and smoked salmon. 
Gym area also nice and complete. 
Hope my review help you to decide this hotel.
",5,2016/07/06
1,REDACTED,en,927,"As a first time traveler to Tokyo, this hotel I feel was ideal. It was easy to find a shuttle at the airport to take us straight to the hotel for a reasonable price. The hotel in my humble opinion is very fancy. The service was great, the rooms were very nice and the one thing that really stuck with me was how great the lobby smelled. The nicest Hilton I have ever stayed in. The shuttle service to the Shinjuku station was also a very nice perk. The location was ideal. Shinjuku is a very fun ward. I loved the breakfast buffet. It had a lot of great options. And the view was phenomenal! I felt like Scarlett Johannsan in Lost In Translation but didn't have to pay Park Hyatt prices.",5,2016/07/06
1,REDACTED,en,928,Wonderful place to stay for a family. We loved the breakfast buffet. The young children had an opportunity to taste different food. The rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed. It was the first hotel we stayed in Japan and was a great introduction to Japan.,5,2016/07/06
1,REDACTED,en,929,"This is a business hotel but is good for families. I selected it because they had a pool with no restrictions and no extra charges. Some Tokyo hotels have lots of tricky rules for families but this was truly an international hotel with no unpleasant surprises.
I travelled with a 6 year old. Rooms are large for Tokyo. 
There is a Denny's next door if you need a cheap western feed for a break. We ate at the hotel breakfast buffet and it was very good. The hotel runs a free shuttle to Shinjuku station.",5,2016/07/06
1,REDACTED,en,930,"Hotel is business oriented, but it could also be good for tourism.
it is located strategically in Shinjuku and they provide a shuttle bus to Shinjuku station where you can take the Yamanote line for any destination. Alternatively you can take the metro few hundred meters away of underground passage.",4,2016/07/06
1,REDACTED,en,931,So many great things about the hotel. First and most important the staff!! AWESOME in every way! Smiling and eager to help in every way. Maybe it was the lost and confused look I had most of the time. Someone was always right there to help. If you are lucky enough to have access to the executive lounge they are the best! Being still on west coast time I was always there at 6 AM getting my latte and the lady at the desk was simply the best! Always smiling and ready to answer the many questions I had. LOCATION!!! Minutes from the action of Shinjuku they even have a free shuttle bus to the station! Super easy!!! From the station there you have access to any train to get you where you want to. Rooms are a bit smaller and the 2 beds are twins but that is the norm in Japan. Thank you Hilton staff for making it a great trip!!!!,5,2016/07/04
1,REDACTED,en,932,"Hilton Tokyo is right in Shinjuku, and only a few minutes from Shinjuku station. The hotel itself is very nice -- it's basically what you'd expect from a nice, Western-style hotel in a major city. The staff speaks great English, the Western breakfast in the executive center is tasty, and the rooms are modern and clean. They offer great views of the city too!",4,2016/07/04
1,REDACTED,en,933,"Spacious room, outstanding shower/bathroom, helpful staff, a wonderful breakfast, a lovely spa (including dry sauna), and an indoor pool. What more could one want from an urban oasis? Well, it is also just steps away from the subway and train stations, some amazing shopping (don't miss disk union if you are a music collector, or the beautiful items in Isetan department store), and lots of nightlife. Enjoy!",5,2016/07/03
1,REDACTED,en,934,We stayed one night on the executive floor which was completely worth the cost. Beautiful hotel and central location. Great food and drinks and family friendly. Ernesto Bressan from guest relations made it memorable and special. Thank you!!!!,5,2016/07/01
1,REDACTED,en,935,"My husband and I stayed at the Hilton for a couple of days after our cruise from Singapore. While the hotel probably caters more to business travelers, it was perfect for our stay. We booked a King Deluxe and then decided to upgrade to have Executive Lounge access which worked out well for us. Very nice, comfortable room with an excellent view. The hotel had a shuttle (well worth using) to the Shinjuku station. If you plan on taking the Narita Express to the airport, ask the concierge for the best route to take to the ticket counter at the station after you get off the shuttle. And make sure to follow the directions, as it can save you LOTS of extra walking. We followed his route and saved a bunch of time. Staff is very pleasant. The breakfast was good and the appetizers in the lounge were nicely done.",4,2016/07/01
1,REDACTED,en,936,"So happy to have rented at this Gem in Shinjuku, Tokyo. After 14 hours in a plane, I appreciated the bus right to the hotel. Staff immediately began assisting me. Albert made the check-in process rewarding with an upgrade. Rooms were rather large for Tokyo but the hotel has plenty of places inside. I am looking forward to return trip back to the land of squared watermelons!
Try the food at the restaurants but make sure to sample the local foods!",5,2016/07/01
1,REDACTED,en,937,"I would first like to commend the staff for their FANTASTIC service! From the manager to the cleaners, everyone was professional and yet very friendly. (Plus points for subtly indicating to guests the bilingual staff members by wearing pins!)

The airport limousine bus conveniently goes drops you off at the Hilton. Upon checking in, I was immediately greeted a happy birthday! With the greeting alone, I was over the moon but they want above and beyond my expectations! Unfortunately, I don't remember his name but the guy who assisted me was either the front desk lead or manager and he walked me up to the second floor to pick out a small cake or two pastries for my birthday. After that, he walked us up to my room, made sure the room was to our liking, and pointed out a birthday card from Hilton Tokyo. --I was blown away!
The room was spacious and neat and the beds were so comfortable. I used their gym facilities and was pretty impressed. They had weights, cardio machines, a pool, tennis courts, and a sauna (or was it a steam room?).
Location wise, not to much is surrounding the Hilton because it is a business district but you can either walk or take the free shuttle bus down to the JR station for many food and shopping selections. The JR station is perfect if you plan to buy tickets for the Shinkansen! (Really easy to do at the machines in the station.) I actually like being a little further away from the action because it isn't noisy and there are no strobe lights glaring into your window.
I didn't eat in the hotel but the buffet on the first floor looked really tempting! You can also purchase airport limousine tickets going back to the airport at the bell hop station. There is also a mail box next to the taxi stand. I dropped off my rented wifi pack there. Very convenient! 
Check out was quick and, again, they greeted me a happy birthday :) It's the little things like that which makes Hilton stand out. Hilton Tokyo is my favorite Hilton property.
I would definitely recommend staying here!",5,2016/06/29
1,REDACTED,en,938,"The staff are great, the rooms are nice and clean (though among the smallest I've had in Japan, and ditto the bathrooms) and it's incredibly handy having a couple of subway stops a short pedway walk under the hotel. Shinjuku, the neighborhood it's in, is never boring, too. The restaurants are nice (if you can get breakfast in the second floor restaurant I recommend it as it's a lot quieter up there). It's nevertheless a very large Hilton that caters to a lot of people and it's easy to get a bit overwhelmed by the hustle and bustle. It too often feels somewhat impersonal, as if it could be a Hilton anywhere. If it were possible to give it 4 1/2 stars I would, but at this time I'd not round it up to 5.",4,2016/06/29
1,REDACTED,en,939,"We stayed in a lovely King Executive room-very comfortable and clean. There did seem to be some guests who were smoking on our floor, even though it was designated as non-smoking. Executive lounge was best for breakfast and a little disappointing for h'ors d'oeuvres, but nice that wine and beer were complimentary. (We found it really nice to be able to start our day with breakfast so easily available!) Gym felt a little small, but space is at a premium in Japan! Location is great-easy to get to trains, shopping and restaurants. Also, 24hr convenience store connected/underneath the hotel was great for snacks and water when my partner had a late check in and everything else was closed.",5,2016/06/28
1,REDACTED,en,940,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at the Hilton Tokyo with my family of five. This hotel is bustling with people from all over the world and even the Japanese rugby team staying there at the same time. 

Rooms 
We were upgraded to an executive Junior suite and an executive king room. Both rooms were very lovely with nicely appointed bathrooms and toiletries and little extras in case anyone forgot toothbrushes etc. we are on one of the higher floors and had beautiful view of Tokyo's skyline. 

Hotel 
It was more polished and refined than I would've imagined and everyone was smartly dressed throughout. 
This seems to be true in the general area that the Hilton is located in and we did not see many people who were casually dressed. 

Concierge 
They were very helpful in getting us on special tours and information on how to get around the city for our family. 

Dining 
We especially enjoyed the executive lounge with The fresh pressed orange shoes you can make yourself in the mornings as well as oatmeal and traditional Japanese breakfast and American breakfast items. 

Downstairs in the lobby however there's also a much larger breakfast which we had for free which was immense in variety and we took full advantage of that before making our way in Tokyo each morning. They had omelettes and eggs to order as well as traditional Japanese breakfast items of all kind and English and American breakfast items as well. 

Tea time
At the time we stayed there they were offering and Alice in Wonderland type of teatime with a beautiful little cakes that said eat me and little yogurt cups that were beautifully decorated that said drink me on them, etc. seemed to be a huge hit so make reservations if you'd like to partake. 

Mall/shopping 
Directly downstairs and still within the hotel you can take the escalators down to a labyrinth of shops available – mostly high-end but even a convenience store and souvenir shops located just downstairs as well for any snacks or items that you'd forgotten from home. There's a few restaurants down there as well for a quick bite to eat and a coffee shop. 

Metro-
also located just downstairs with and at the Hilton complex is a metro station – but be aware that there are different companies of metros and trains and they're all not the same so your ticket may not work for every stop. It's best to check with the concierge on where you're going if you're unsure. 

My family very much enjoyed this location that was in downtown Tokyo near everything!

1,REDACTED,en,941,This hotel is great for business and accommodating American travelers. There are a number of people that speak English at this hotel and the staff are very helpful. The rooms are nice and comfortable. It also is in a great location.,5,2016/06/27
1,REDACTED,en,942,"We used HHonors points for an Executive King. The comfortable and (for Japan) spacious room was not on the Executive Floor but we had lounge access for breakfast, afternoon tea and happy hour drinks and snacks. Our only fault is that there were too many children in the lounge at happy hour--if your children need a nanny they should not be in the executive lounge and you should police their boisterous behavior if you bring them. This is not the hotel's fault. 

The lounge breakfast was sparce, but we were allowed to use the main restaurant on the first floor or the somewhat quieter and more personalized restaurant on the second floor. The breakfast buffet had a huge range of hot and cold western and Japanese dishes, juices, and a made-to-order egg and omelette station. The second floor had less variety but everything you could want.

The bed was comfortable. Japanese screens blocked the 04h20 sunrise very effectively. Cable TV and wifi worked very well

Concierge and lobby staff were helpful, well-informed and gave good directions and free time suggestions. One gave us a printout of the kabuki theater options, which were helpful to orient ourselves for purchasing a 'stand-by' ticket to one act. Kabuki is something you should see if you have the time.

The Hilton Tokyo is well-located in Shinjuku. The Airport Limousine stops at the front door and the hotel runs a shuttle to Shinjuku station. The hotel's downstairs shopping arcade gives direct access to the Marounuchi subway line.",5,2016/06/27
1,REDACTED,en,943,A very classy establishment. You are treated by a wonderful aroma reminiscent of green tea and ginger as you walk in. The staff always greets you and do a polite bow as you pass. There are free bicycle rentals at the hotel if you want to explore Tokyo on bike. Room was extremely clean and quiet. The rooms have yukatas and slippers available for your use and Peter Thomas Roth products. The shuttle bus between the hotel and Shinjuku station was invaluable. Very happy with my stay there and would return.,5,2016/06/27

1,REDACTED,en,948,"This was my first visit to Hilton Shinjuku and it was good enough to get an immediate return visit the next weekend. Everything about this stay was pleasurable. The checkin process on the 37 floor executive lounge was quick and easy. The quality and size of room was perfect. Water pressure in the shower was one of the best I have experienced and I have been traveling 26 years now with 250 nights a year on average. Yes, I am a Hilton Diamond Member and they treated me as such. He nightly cocktails and apps are superb and not cheap stuff. Breakfast buffet is one of the biggest you will see outside of Las Vegas. Everything is of top quality. Beds are firm and comfortable with excellent sheets. If I have one complaint, on the second trip my room was missing any outlet that would accept as three pronged US laptop charging plug, but a quick call brought an adapter right away. I am quite picky and this hotel will not leave you disappointed.",5,2016/06/23
1,REDACTED,en,949,"We spent 4 nights at the Shinjuku Hilton and had a very positive experience.

The location near the Shinjuku station means you can get anywhere quickly. The immediate neighborhood is good, albeit more business-like than a tourist area. 

Staff was uniformly helpful, with very good english spoken by all.

The breakfast buffet was outstanding, with a variety of Western and Japanese food available. We did not eat other meals at the hotel.

Our room qualified us for access to the 37th-floor lounge, which we enjoyed nightly. Like Hilton's everywhere, it was well-stocked with munchies and drinks, and window tables had a nice view.

Our room was very nice; spacious and comfortable for two.

I think this would be an absolutely outstanding hotel for a business visit, and for tourists that might be looking for a very Western hotel where English is widely understood and that has all the comforts of a Western hotel. In fact it may be TOO western for some tourists.

We had absolutely no disappointments while at the Shinjuku Hilton. 

Tourist tip: the observation deck at the nearby Tokyo Metro Government tower is outstanding, close by, and FREE!",4,2016/06/22

The gym has been significantly updated and there is now more equipment and you'll be pleased with the choices. 

One key benefit for those working in the city and then traveling later in the day of check-out is a very nice on-site service. You can check-out of your hotel room on time in the morning and then when you return, they will permit you to use the facilities in the fitness center to clean-up before you travel. 

Still a world class facility. I'll be back.",5,2016/06/21

Your employees Ernesto Bressan and Yoshihis Tamura went the extra mile for us. They were both helpful, charming, inviting and all around awesome employees. We feel they made our stay the best ever. It was an honor to meet these two. We were treated like royalty. We will definitely recommend this hotel. It was more than we could have ever imagined. The service in every area was top quality. We liked the fact that all your staff could speak English and could help us in everyway. Such a fantastic hotel. It made our stay a very happy stay. The food was great also. The convenience of having shops under the hotel, the metro under the hotel and a shuttle bus to the middle of the city was a bonus. We already want to plan another stay at this Tokyo Hilton. We want to thank all of you, the staff and especially Ernesto Bressan and Yoshihis Tamura for making our 33rd anniversary one that we will never forget. Always Gerry & Ann Valvona",5,2016/06/20
1,REDACTED,en,955,"This hotel is everything you would expect from a Hilton in a world capitol, and represents everything I love about the brand. 

The first thing you notice about the Hilton Tokyo, even from the sidewalk, is the wonderful fragrance of the lobby and common areas. The hotel has a special blend of essential oils that wafts through these areas. For about 5000 yen, you can even take the scent of the hotel home with you. 

We used HHonors points for two rooms for six nights. I had put in for a Stand-By upgrade to Executive Level rooms, and the upgrade came through for one room. The hotel then gave me a complementary upgrade for the other. 

The rooms were beautiful and tasteful. The shower was outstanding. The light-weight cotton kimonos called yukatas had a unique pattern and were amply sized for Western bodies. 

The Executive Lounge on the 38th floor had excellent service and snacks. They also had a good selection of non-alcoholic drinks, even chocolate milk. 

All of the staff I came in contact with had fair to good English skills. I want to give special recognition to Eduardo from Guest Relations, who assisted the desk clerk with check-in and made us feel very welcome after a long trans-Pacific flight, and Waki, the server on the 2nd floor who greeted us every morning at breakfast with warmth and enthusiasm. He has such a love for his job!

The hotel is connected by tunnels to two subway stations. It also has a shuttle to Shijuku train station, the busiest in the world, but we took the ten minute walk most of the time.

The hotel is modern, super clean (a constant in all Hilton Hotels and a constant in every place you visit in Tokyo).

Nisei-Shinjuku Station is less than five minutes walking and the big Shinjuku Station (where you can take not only metro trains but also the bullet trains that travel to popular destinations) is less than 15 minutes walking on beautiful promenades.

There are several places to eat around the hotel.

If you take the “Limousine Bus” (highly recommended as it cost the same price as the train), it will stop right at Hilton’s door. This is very convenient for guests arriving from long flights, without knowing how to use the trains / metro lines etc. 

In our case, we had to “battle” with 16 hours timezone, as we flew from Vancouver Canada. We felt as “zumbis” when we got there. Taking the Limousine Bus without worrying of pushing luggage and getting lost was priceless. Arrival at Hilton was super smooth and we were welcomed by the friendly staff there.

In my opinion, this is the best place to stay in Tokyo and we will stay there next time we visit this marvelous city.",5,2016/06/19
1,REDACTED,en,957,"Stayed for 3 nights at the Hilton. Was given a free upgrade when I checked in even thou I hv forgotten to bring my HHonors card. They try retrieving it from the system but was not able to find it. Instead they applied for a new card for me. The lady who checked me in (If I recalled correctly she is Nakamura San) is simply excellent and tremendously helpful. 

The upgraded deluxe room is big by Tokyo standard and very comfortable. Nakamura San did mentioned thou that this room is slightly bigger than normal deluxe room that they have.

Location wise it is about 10-15min walk to the train station but it provides free shuttle every 20 mins, so it's never an issue.

Overall, this is a very busy hotel but it's staff are always friendly and helpful nonetheless.",4,2016/06/19
1,REDACTED,en,958,Love the room and e check in. Very friendly staff and very attentive. Great stay for the family. Location away from the crowd yet close enough to the the main attractions.

1,REDACTED,en,959,I have stayed in many 5-star hotel but Hilton was the best and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! The staff was friendly and they address you by name. The food was awesome and the service was more than what I expected. The shuttle service to Shinjuku station was a good idea.,5,2016/06/16
1,REDACTED,en,960,"we enjoyed our stay here a lot. great location, friendly staff, amazing breakfast and nice room. The location is everything and if you are a hilton honors person especially, you can't beat the price in Tokyo. I also think that Shinjuku is the place to stay-- near the subway and also near a lot of great shopping etc. It's very central. The hotel is big, but you don't feel it because the staff is very warm and friendly. I would stay here again.",5,2016/06/16
1,REDACTED,en,961,"We stayed at the Hilton Tokyo earlier this month. While the hotel is a big property, we never felt like it was impersonal and to the contrary, we were given great personal attention both by the front desk and staff at the concierge and executive level. We were able to upgrade to an executive level room with access to the lounge. The personnel within the lounge were extremely friendly. We were able to eat breakfast at the lounge on a daily basis, as well as grab snacks and drinks in the afternoon/evening. Getting access to the lounge is a great benefit to staying at the hotel and the staff make you feel special. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016/06/16

We were made to feel very welcome from start to finish of our stay. Our room was beautiful, very clean and modern.

The breakfast was better on the first floor as less noisy and busy than the foyer.

The best bit was the executive lounge access as part of the room, quite a feast in the evening and a spectacular view of Mount Fuji.",4,2016/06/14
1,REDACTED,en,963,"As a HH member for more then ten years I´ve stayed at lots of Hilton hotels all over the World. Some disapointing (mostly US hotels) and some over expactations. Checking in at Tokyo Hilton for the first time with it´s 803 rooms I had no special expectations. So what a positive surprise it was all from check-in counter to room upgrade, friednliness and helpfulness from all staff. Special thanks to Haruna Yoshimi and all her lounge staff. Best lounge and treatment we ever had. So all in all my wife and I agreed upon that this is the very best Hilton that we ever stayed at.",5,2016/06/14
1,REDACTED,en,964,This hotel is top notch. I've stayed in a lot of nice hotels and the only one that compares in my book was the Pallazo in Vegas. This staff was great in Tokyo. Special accommodations for my family were made and greatly appreciated!,5,2016/06/12
1,REDACTED,en,965,"It took me a bit to write about this great hotel with a great location and superb employees but unfortunately they have completed downgraded their services and amenities in the Executive Lounge. This hotel used to have the best service and the best food and drinks in any Hilton worldwide that I've ever visited. 
Nowadays, even though it's in the same location their happy hour has gone from having a bartender making the finest cocktails to as low as get your own beer or wine or make yourself your own drink with the few limited bottles they have displayed. Food wise they had the best food during happy hour with great sushi, exquisite rice, fine beef, great chicken or awesome seafood to mostly cold finger food nicely decorated but of the lowest quality. 
It is certainly disappointing for loyal HHonors members and for the guests that pay the outrageously high rates for an executive room. I never saw this coming from this lounge in Tokyo. 
Nevertheless, the hotel maintains its great customer service and great food at their restaurant. I still recommend this awesome hotel but will discourage people to pay executive room rates unless you don't mind the downgrade of drinks, food and services in the lounge.",4,2016/06/11
1,REDACTED,en,966,"Had a recent three night stay. Booked a junior suite and was upgraded to an executive suite. Room was nice and spacious, but a very small bathroom. Closet area near entrance was also very dark (inadequate lighting). As an executive level guest you can have breakfast in the lounge or from a selection of the two main restaurants. I preferred the second floor restaurant as it had a slightly larger selection of Japanese food for breakfast and was more quiet.
Proficient service and decent facilities. The building is older so the ceilings are lower in the rooms. Location is fairly convenient but also extremely quiet as it is a bit of a walk from the main Shinjuku station. Small fitness center which was well maintained, I think there is also an additional annex with more space to exercise.
It is a large hotel with a convention atmosphere almost. I don't think you could go wrong with this hotel, though it is not a luxury hotel.",4,2016/06/11
1,REDACTED,en,967,"This was my first trip to Tokyo and Japan so I decided to stay at the Hilton based on reviews and previous experiences with other Hiltons. I enjoyed my stay but think I might try another hotel next time. It is nice but I felt it was missing something that would make you rave about it.
Pros- 
Location
Free shuttle to Shinjuku station
Size of the rooms and decor
Shower and bath were lovely, good water pressure
Free wifi if you are a hilton honours member
Business center
housekeeping
Cons-
The foyer has hardly any seating so if you are waiting for the shuttle or friends good luck getting a seat
The concierge weren't overly friendly or maybe I was just unlucky, you also had to wait quite a but as there was often only 1 or 2 working at the desk
Toiletries in the room weren't very nice, not a major thing but considering the price they could do better
The beds are not as nice as the ones at other Hiltons, I found it really too firm!
I stayed in a king deluxe room for 7 nights",4,2016/06/11
1,REDACTED,en,968,"This review is focused on the Concierge desk and the help provided by their Chief Concierge, Mr. Keisuke Sakamoto. One of our group did not know that he had a strong allergy to buck wheat found in soba noodles. Two bites of soba and additional bites of udon noodles had him swelling up in hives all over his body and constriction of his airway, although not immediately life threatening but was headed in that direction. What does one do in a foreign country where one does not speak Japanese? Call the concierge desk and seek help. Mr. Sakamoto who spoke English acted as our interpreter ensuring the sense of medical urgency, medical questions and clarity of the situation was understood by the hospital emergency room staff who did not speak English very well. He was patient, understanding, compassionate yet firm when the patient's health was discussed. He directed us to the nearest emergency room and accompanied us. He stayed with my daughter's boyfriend well beyond his working shift to ensure that he was being properly treated and was on the road to recovery. Before he left he made sure we knew the status of his condition and what was being done for him. The next day he offered to help us get his medical records from the hospital that would help our him get partial reimbursement from his medical plan when he returned home. Such service and the depth of the concierge staff coverage that would allow the Chief Concierge to stay with us while his staff took care of anything else that came up at the hotel shows you how Hilton trains and develops their staff to be able to address situations such as this without skipping a beat. The personal service provided by Mr. Sakamoto was above and beyond the call of his duty at the Hilton or reflects the value the Hilton has for their guests.

Overall the service from the Hilton was extraordinary, they anticipated our needs before we could express them and that was from everyone from the front desk, bell desk, concierge, executive lounge, housekeeping. Some of them remembered our names after our first encounter.

One of the best things we like was the Executive Lounge on the 37th floor. The spacious arrangements and quaint tables with a breakfast spread that included both Japanese dishes as well as American. Dinner was the same and delicious. All was included in the Executive benefits.

The bathroom was Japanese designed with a deep bathtub and an area where you could shower separately before sinking into the hot waters of the bathtub. Aaahhhhh!!!!! One thing I would recommend is to include a small stool so that you could take a shower sitting down, prevents the chance of slipping on the soap suds on the floor. Inclusion of the small stool would make the bathroom more of an Onsen - traditional setup.

We appreciated the two complimentary bottles of water Hilton provided each day we were there. They came in handy when you are out discovering Tokyo.",5,2016/06/10
1,REDACTED,en,969,"Excellent hotel, always favorite and place to stay for me while in Tokyo for business. Located just small walk away from Shinjuku station. High quality service, rooms, food and everything. Whenever I'm here, it's completely different feeling, just love this hotel!",5,2016/06/10
1,REDACTED,en,970,"I stayed in several different hotels during my two weeks vacation in Japan, but Hilton Tokyo had the cleanest room, friendliest & most helpful staff, dependable WiFi, and was close to a lot of attractions!",5,2016/06/09
1,REDACTED,en,971,"The Hilton is situated in a quiet area not too far from Shinjuku station. A regular free shuttle bus service operates between the hotel and Shinjuku station (the bus stop is outside the Keio department store), which is very convenient and was well utilised during our stay. A family mart, 7/11 and McDonalds are located nearby and there are several places to eat within walking distance from the hotel. 

The hotel room itself was clean, comfortable and a decent size by Japan standards. Noise was not an issue during our stay nor was light shining through the windows first thing in the morning, which allowed for us to get a decent sleep. Free wifi is provided if you are a member of the Hilton's HHonors loyalty scheme, otherwise you need to pay. However, you can sign up for this free of charge on arrival and get instant wifi connectivity, which was really good and worked well.

The hotel offers an airport shuttle bus service at an additional cost, which although a convenient means of getting to the airport, the first 40 minutes of the journey is spent collecting additional passengers around central Tokyo. Even though the hotel requests reservations for this service to be made 3 days in advance, they were kind enough to let us make a reservation only 1 day before our departure date.

We did not use any of the other facilities at this hotel so cannot comment. 

The staff were really helpful and friendly, particularly one of the girls at the concierge (Sophie) who went above and beyond her normal duties to help us with our coach trip to Kawaguchiko. Cannot praise them enough for their excellent service! Thank you!",4,2016/06/08
1,REDACTED,en,972,"We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Tokyo and visited the Hilton a couple of times during our stay and the atmosphere and food were pretty amazing!

As someone who doesn't really enjoy breakfast as much as one should, I was actually pretty happy with the service offered by the staff as well as the variety of their breakfast service.

I've never been to a hotel that offered such a variety of foods. You have the option of enjoying food from outside of Japan or enjoying a traditional Japanese breakfast. The fact that they can appeal to just about everyone (even us folk who don't appreciate breakfast as much as we should) gains my respect. 

I like being able to enjoy fresh smoothies with my meals and even detox water. They offer about 4 different kinds of milk; banana milk included (recommend trying it!) 

They have an egg station where you can get yourself anything from an omlette to a simple hard boiled egg. 

The cold cuts and cheese was a great spot for those who want to either kick up an appetite or keep it light. It's great that they have it set up next to the fruit with humidifiers so they food doesn't dry out and get gross. 

I thought that being in Japan it would be hard to fjnd some good food that reminded me of home but when I tried their french toast and hash browns I have to say that they far exceed what I've had back in Canada. Everything just seems to be on point. 

Despite being from another hotel, the staff were very kind to us and made us feel welcome. I overheard a young boy asking whom I believe was the manager if they had hot chocolate and he promptly set off to find some for him. That is someone dedicated to customer service and it's the little things when you see how happy the patrons are. 

I wish I could take this home with me so I can continue to eat the amazing food offered at the Hilton. 

Even if you're not staying at the Hilton, I highly suggest making the trip over there one morning if you're nearby.

Bravo!",5,2016/06/03
1,REDACTED,en,973,"Had a couple of days at the Hilton as a base for doing the tourist bit of Tokyo -the location in Shinjuku served my needs very well especially as it seemed to offer more variety on the doorstep in the evenings -lots of shops and restaurants etc....as well as its proximity to a major railway/metro hub.

The junior suite was looking a bit dated and tired and the bathroom was the smallest I have experienced on my travels for a long time -needless to say it would have been nicer to have got a refurbished room, maybe better luck next time?!

The bar on the 2nd floor was quite lively when I attended and the food outlets on the same floor all looked very appealing but I decided to eat out and enjoy some local food and atmosphere.

Overall its a good non descript functional chain hotel that does what it says on the tin and on this occasion that is what I was after.....",4,2016/06/02
1,REDACTED,en,974,"This is my second visit to the Hilton Tokyo. It's tucked away from Shinjuku station in a quiet area close to a very nice park, near restaurants. We upgraded to a suite which was large for Tokyo standards. The amenities were excellent. We had a problem with noise though. It seems either the walls are paper thin or the ceilings are because for our five night stay - during two nights we heard non-stop stomping above us. Finally after the second night the hotel manager moved us to the top floor which eliminated the stomping above us. The hotel goes the extra mile as it acknowledged our anniversary with wine, chocolates and cookies and when we had to move rooms they gave us more chocolates. We ate dinner at the Metropolitan Grill and the price for two was close to $400 Canadian so not cheap! The food was good of course. As tip...there are great restaurants down the street at Shinjuku Island Tower. Overall a quality hotel.",4,2016/06/02
1,REDACTED,en,975,We stayed at the Hilton Tokyo for 8 nights in May 2016 with out two young children (3 years old and 7 months old). We had interconnecting rooms on the 17th floor which were superb. The room with a King sized bed had a lovely bathroom combing western and Japanese influences. The screens on the windows were a nice Japanese touch too. The buffet breakfast in the Marble Lounge is good but at peak hour we were seated in the smoke-smelling adjoining bar. The lack of proper highchairs for babies and toddlers in the Marble Lounge was frustrating given they are at other restaurants. Our flight home was delayed 9 hours. They staff were accommodating and extended our checkout free of charge. Nishi-Shinjuku is very much a business area.,5,2016/06/02
1,REDACTED,en,976,"We loved our room. We booked the King Junior Suite, and for the price, it was almost perfect! Spacious, comfortable, clean. The view was great and the big windows made the rooms even more spacious.

My only complaints about the room would be that there was no Nespresso Machine, which is what we are used to when we book hotel rooms. Considering they called it a suite, it could use a Nespresso Machine. Also, the shower was not built well that every time we would shower, the outside area would flood, and the water would go into the toilet stall.

We would order room service quite a bit for the kids, and I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it. Desserts were excellent, and room service was quick and efficient, and the food pretty good.

Buffet breakfast could use a bit of sprucing up, as the three mornings we had breakfast there, all hot foot remained the same. It could use a bit of variety. However, the wait staff was absolutely wonderful and took care of the kids and entertained them! Excellent, excellent service!

On our last day, we were trying to figure out the best way to transfer to Hilton Tokyo Bay, and the concierge service was excellent! They did not give up finding the best mode of transportation for us (a group of seven with big pieces of luggage is not easily moved around). We explored all options together, and they called several mini van rental services to find us a mini van. This was the best level of service I have experienced! Perfect!

Overall, I was very, very happy we chose to stay here. Location is central, but not too noisy and messy. Service impeccable. Rooms clean and well maintained. Food pretty good.",4,2016/06/01
1,REDACTED,en,977,"With a good room size, silent windows and nice views over Shinjuku, Hilton Tokyo is a good place to stay. 

The bar is eclectic and the DJ plays nice music while the bartenders expertly serve you various cocktails and Hibiki on ice 

The breakfast served is lavish and has few options for veggies. You have to look and pick or make do with fruits, fresh kale juice, wide bread selection or milk shakes. The staff is extremely welcoming and warm, with traditional Japanese hospitality. I wanted an omlette made and even before i could speak my preference, the chef asked me if i wanted it well done, which is the way most Indians do!

A shuttle takes us to Shinjuku station every 20-25 min and brings us back as well. There are some more eating options in the mall next door. A good place to stay if you want to work in central Tokyo or Shinjuku itself but far if u want to go to Big Sight expo centre (I had to) 

In any case, the Hilton is a nice place to stay and enjoy the good life!

1,REDACTED,en,978,"We enjoyed our stay at the Tokyo Hilton. Location wise it is not as close to the area of Shinjuku we hoped to frequent just by walking -- in January of 2015 we stayed at the Century Southern Hotel and location wise it was much preferable. That being said, for the Hilton stay it was May and VERY close to a subway station. Beautiful lobby with very friendly staff. The dinner buffet was excellent. The rooms were small but decent for Tokyo standards and always very clean. We stayed here for 14 nights and really enjoyed it! Very comfortable bed and a nice closet to store our things. I would recommend it but location wise, if you are looking to be able to walk to the bright lights of Shinjuku in a few minutes, there are closer hotels.",4,2016/05/31

The staff are polite and kind and since I've stayed there numerous times, they recognize me and greet me each time. Having said this, they are more particular about their executive lounge than any other Hilton I know (and I know a lot). If they don't have room for you on the Exec Floor, you can't use the lounge. It's too small, I think, and the same with their lobby--nowhere to sit. But still it's location is superb, and the staff are great, and I love the breakfasts!",5,2016/05/27
1,REDACTED,en,985,"The Hilton Tokyo definitely ranks near the top of my list of best Hilton hotels I have stayed at globally. From the moment of arrival, I was greeted and checked in.

The rooms were clean and well maintained. All the necessary toiletries and amenities were fully available and placed in room. The views from the room were excellent views into the city. The hotel also has many in house restaurants to choose from. The fitness centre was very modern and clean.

The concierge I have to make a special mention as they were instrumental in assisting us to find all the sites around Tokyo. They went out of their way to not only explain it, but print details from their PC to provide to us and suggest other things to do. When it came to planning My Fuji and taking the bullet train, we were told the best stop to go for best view and all. This made the trip extra special and enjoyable.

The bed was big enough for me to have a decent nights sleep. Being 6""1 I thought I'd struggle in Japan but it wasn't the case.

The staff were ever so friendly and extremely helpful. We really enjoyed our stay and would probably stay here again if we visit Tokyo again. The free shuttle bus runs every 20mins to take you to and from shinjuku station should you need it.

You can grab an Airport Express Bus to and from the hotel for a 1 1/2 hr ride to Narita (or less to Haneda).

I agree with others that the bar prices are high, however what do you expect staying in a 4 star hotel in one of the most fascinating cities in the world. To all the Hilton staff you really did do well looking after so many guests. 
Exceptionally clean, breakfast buffet is superb. Highly recommend this hotel.Superb views of the city from all rooms. A tip a few blocks away is a government building with a fantastic observatory for free, about 10 mins walk, it opens until 11pm so you can see Tokyo by night !!",5,2016/05/22

Unfortunately, I encountered a horrible experience at the hotel breakfast. The stomach issue came right after I had omelettes for breakfast at St. George's Bar. I was plagued with a stomach virus that wiped me out on the only weekend I had to explore Tokyo. Perhaps I was the unlucky candidate but I don't blame the staff at all. It was just very unfortunate. 

Another issue that actually bothered me was this: I found this hotel through Trip Advisor and booked it through them. If you wanted to earn Hilton points, never book through a 3rd party website because you won't be able to earn any of the hotel points. Had I known, I would have booked directly on Hilton's website.

1,REDACTED,en,1002,"This Hilton sits in a busy downtown high rise area. As a tourist, it's not the best location, other than being close to the metro and train. If you are a tourist it's more fun to stay in Shibuya or Asakusa. That being said, it's a comfortable hotel with an adequate room. The food and drinks are ridiculously expensive and no water or coffee is provided for free. There are a lot of choices just outside the hotel, so no need to spend $20 for a cocktail. The info on the website about there being a shuttle to the hotel from the train station isn't entirely accurate. There is a shuttle a block away from the Shinjuku Station. You have to leave the station, cross the street, go around the corner and walk up half a block. The shuttle bus only goes from this stop to the hotel and back and runs every 20 minutes.",3,2016/05/19

The breakfast buffet was outstanding and the regular shuttle bus to shinjuku station invaluable. Concierge incredibly helpful. 
Gym was well equipped but a bit too warm .

Probably would not have stayed personally as it is very expensive - as you would expect for Tokyo. It is a nice hotel and was upgraded to a refurbished room. Admittedly is not super luxurious as other Asian hotels but very clean and efficient. Some of the wait staff at the main lobby restaurant was very surprisingly not up to the usual Japanese well trained and hospitable class.

Breakfast has a possibility of 3 locations one strictly for Hilton high-level guests and that includes option in executive lounge. 
They offer a free shuttle to the Shinjuku station which sometimes there might be a long line.
The restaurant options are nice but a little pricey for what you get. They are new and nicely decorated though.

1,REDACTED,en,1023,"This is a pretty typical business hotel. Nothing special but nothing horrible either.

The best part about this hotel is their buffet breakfast, huge selection and good quality everything.

The worst part of this hotel is the front desk check-in staff and associated management processes. I am Hilton Honors Gold for many years and i visit this hotel often, in spite of that they are always playing little games at check-in, try to slot me into a smoking room or a room with two double beds as opposed to the King size non smoking room I always book.

More than once they even said we will upgrade you to exec room with lounge privileges but then when i get to the room it is two double beds as opposed to a king bed. I go all the way back downstairs, wait in the ling again and then tell them I booked a king. Their response ""well we upgraded you"" I said, I would prefer the standard king with no lounge over sleeping in a tiny bed. They said, they couldn't change me back to my original king size preference even without the lounge access since they already gave my king size room to someone else. 

They tried this bait and switch again on me during my last trip there as well but when the front desk lady gave me the key card and informed me of the upgrade I told her I only want it if the room is a king size non-smoking...then she said no it's two small beds. Then I had to wait while she ""downgraded me"" and talked to management about finding a king size bed. 

After a long flight and being tired they should not put you through all of those hassles. Very unprofessional.

So the good part of the hotel is the breakfast, bad part is the front desk. The rooms are small but clean and comfortable. Bathroom is really tiny.",3,2016/05/10

1,REDACTED,en,1026,"The room is nice and spacious enough with a city view and I loved that they did their windows and shades in the traditional ryokan style! That, I thought, was a very nice touch.

Location wise, they are ok. It's a short walk to the nearest station - Tochomae. And it takes maybe about 10 -15 minutes to walk to Shinjuku Station, depending on how fast you walk. Otherwise, just take a taxi. It'll cost you around 800 yen but it's a good choice after you are tired out from shopping in Shinjuku!

The staff are lovely and they have these petite Japanese ladies in suits and hats helping us in & out of taxis. And one was even so sweet to remember us leaving the hotel to visit the nearby Hanazono Shrine and when she helped us out of the taxi on our return, asked us how the shrine visit went!

Really good gym. The breakfast is really good with a lot of options. If you can, get it included in the room rate. It is a lot cheaper than paying out of pocket for it. We ate there every day. Go down early as it get can busy but they have plenty of tables. If is super busy, some over flow goes in the bar area where smoking is allowed and I did notice a little smoky smell. It might disturb some people but after a couple of minutes it did not bother me. Going down in the morning, the elevators can become bottle necks even with 6 elevators. This only occurred 1 or 2 mornings but take note of it.

There is a little mall in the basement with a 24 hour convenience store that also sells souvenirs. A friend picked up last minute items there the day he left saving him time. There is also a nice little coffee shop. In the morning, it is a little quieter there than in the lobby.

It is between 2 subway stops and Shinjuku station is pretty close by. There is an area several blocks nearby with restaurants and bars.",4,2016/05/04
1,REDACTED,en,1032,"First what we loved about the hotel, the room was modern and very nice (thanks so much for the upgrade to a Jr. Suite!!), the Executive Lounge was very nice for breakfast (loved the orange juicer, and there was sparkling wine next to the juicer in case you wanted to have a mimosa!), and we really enjoyed the private lounge that was available to HHonors Diamond members in the evenings for drinks/snacks. We were told there was a separate dining room for Diamonds during breakfast at the restaurant, but we wanted to eat early and the Lounge served breakfast at 6 compared to 7 (I think it was 7) for the restaurant.

The location was good. If the timing works for the shuttle, then that was very convenient to get a ride from the hotel to Shinjuku Station. Otherwise, it was a 10-15 minute walk, which was fine as long as the weather was good. We also liked the fact that the shuttle bus stop for the Hilton at Shinjuku station was next to the ticket office for the Airport Limousine Bus. We had arrived from Hakone by train, so we were able to purchase our one way bus ticket / one day subway pass combo ticket before catching the shuttle to the Hilton.

We were allowed to check in early around 1pm.

The hotel had a very nice spread set up for my partner's birthday (Voss waters, fruits, chocolates, Japanese sweets, card from the GM)! Thank you so much!

Things that could improve. The guy that checked us in was good, but he never once mentioned that we had been upgraded to a Jr Suite. IMO, he should have mentioned it and let us know why (either because of our Diamond status or because we were celebrating my partner's birthday). Just seemed like a missed opportunity to not mention our upgrade to us.

We communicated with the concierge team and asked many questions. Unlike the Westin Kyoto and the Conrad Tokyo, who were super nice and helpful, we felt like the Hilton's concierge team's responses at times were short and they gave us the impression we were bothering them, so we ended up just asking Mieko at the Conrad for help.


Overall, we really enjoyed our stay, and would choose the Hilton over the Park Hyatt if staying in Shinjuku!",4,2016/05/04

Great service begins when the bellman takes your bags and the front desk clerk (we were welcomed by Monica) recognizes your Hilton status and provides appropriate room upgrades.

This Hilton boasts a full-service exercise area--machines, weights, swimming pool, tennis courts, and a full Japanese bath, complete with sauna and hot tub. You could eat in a different restaurant every day and never leave the premises.

The Executive Lounge (wonderfully managed by Haruna Yoshimi) serves an excellent breakfast, snacks throughout the day, tea and evening cocktails and snacks.

The concierge (Sakamoto helped us) patiently answers all your questions about how to get to where you need to go.

Get the breakfast package. Breakfast buffet includes both Asian and western items of excellent quality. Egg dishes are made to order. Juices seem fresh squeezed. We really enjoyed it. Probably really expensive if paid separately.

It is a very modern Hilton with some amazing restaurants (I highly recommend the tepanyaki restaurant - best teppanyaki I have had).

The exec lounge is great as well.

The only thing to consider though is that their concierge desk is not what most of us expect from a concierge service. When I wanted tickets to football or restaurant bookings, they told me how to do it but didn't do any of it themselves which meant a lot of running around on my part. I am used to a concierge service that delivers all that for you - if I had known that they don't really actively help in booking tours, etc, I would have booked all of that before I went on holiday.

1,REDACTED,en,1048,"Stayed in the executive suite at the Hilton hotel in Shinjuku. It was good value for money as we enjoyed the afternoon tea and pre dinner drinks and snacks. This is a nice luxury to have especially if you are spending more time at the hotel. However if you are sightseeing then maybe reconsider staying in the executive suite. The room was great and the view from the 30th floor fantastic. I found the bathroom a bit small with the bathtub and the shower all together. There are two breakfast areas -on the ground floor and on the 1st floor. We preferred the 1st floor as it seemed quiet. The Japanese breakfast was very good-especially the prawn dim sum. The waiters spoke English. I must admit though after being in Japan for over 3 weeks and travelling through the country, I missed the traditional Japanese greeting of Ohayo gozaimass in the morning ! The waiters in Japan almost sing the traditional greeting and when you leave the breakfast area I missed the traditional goodbye, the bows and the smiley faces. I stayed at another hotel in Tokyo and loved the friendliness, respect and proper Japanese hospitality that I was accorded with. The staff at the Hilton are friendly and hospitable but they need to be more ""Japanese"" because in my opinion the Japanese take hospitality and respect to another level. They take it to a level that I have never seen anywhere else in the world and it is that traditional respect that they should nurture and encourage and not try to change to suit a Western perspective. This could be a Hilton hotel anywhere in the world-I wish it had more of an authentic Japanese feel. There are many travelers who may actually see this as a positive. I also enjoyed a massage by Sukakada at the spa and this was the best massage that I had in Japan. The spa was also good and I wished I discovered that earlier so that I could use it more frequently. The hotel has a shuttle to the Shinjuku bus terminal. There are 3 huge department stores ; Lumine 1,2 and 3, Odaiko and Keio. The train station and subway are easily accessible. We found the shuttle very convenient.If you need to book high tea or dinner at the hotel its best to make reservations as we noticed that the hotel is extremely busy. My opinion is that the Hilton is fabulous and intercontinental but not true authentic Japanese accommodation. If that is what you want, stay in a Ryokan with tatami mats and a fabulous onsen. All in all, it was an excellent stay in Tokyo at the Hilton.",5,2016/04/26

Sadly, I will no longer stay nor recommend that any of my family, friends, colleagues nor associates stay at this disappointing property. 

The gentleman that introduced me to this property back in 1996, passed away tis past February. My friend, Mr Gotoh, was not impressed with the hotel or the location but the service as well. I was able to see this first hand and began introducing it to my close circle of business friends and colleagues too.

Over the years, the Shinjuku Hilton provided comfort and ease of access while traveling for business in Japan. Sadly, this ended this past February...

As I stated, my friend, Mr Gotoh introduced me to this property. He passed suddenly and without warning in February. I only found out days after he past and without hesitation booked a ticket to Japan to attend his funeral. He was a brother to me and treated me and my family like his family. 

Not only was Mr Gotoh a loyal friend and colleague but he was also loyal to businesses and services that were good to him.

I made a reservation to stay at the Shinjuku Hilton after the conclusion of Mr Gotoh's funeral to relive and enjoy memories that I shared in the past. Unfortunately, the reservation system stated that I made the reservation for the night prior to my desired stay of Feb 10th. Upon my arrival, the reception clerk tried to explain the issue to the reservations manager several times but was ultimately told to charge me for a night that I did not stay nor reserve. Additionally, I was told that I would have to pay full price for the evening that I was checking in.

After an exhaustive back and forth, after already mourning the death of my brother like friend, I was told I would not get a refund and that I would have to pay for the current nights stay! I was in utter disbelief. What does the word HOSPITALITY mean to you anyway Mrs reservations manager? Does a full house and Numbers mean more to you that a pleasant experience for someone that has been staying at your property for more than 20+ years?

Needless to stay, I will never again stay at the Shinjuku Hilton nor will I will refer my vast network of business colleagues or associates to stay there either. There are so many other great options. I fought hard over the years to sell this property to my business friends and family and this is the thanks I get???

1,REDACTED,en,1055,Stayed at the Hilton for a few nights in April. Facility was excellent and in very good condition. Staff was friendly and helpful.

1,REDACTED,en,1057,"We just finished a 4 night stay at this fine big hotel. We were here for medical meetings and pleasure. The hotel suits both very well. Easy arrival by subway, with it's own entrance from the underground network(C8). Excellent concierge staff, ATM that handles north american cards, fine breakfast. Many good restaurants nearby. A solid choice whatever your purpose in Tokyo. By the way, we had no problems using public transportation with our suitcases( medium sized).",5,2016/04/23

When I checked in the last time solo, I became a second class guest. There was a difference in the way I was treated as well as the amenities available. Request for bag pick up at a specific time made with front desk staff was not relayed to bell captain and hence made my exit from the hotel a rush as I almost missed the bus to the airport. I will continue to stay here in the future since the location and previous experience was good. Hoping that I will treated the same next time whether with a diamond member companion or not.",3,2016/04/23

The gym and pool is amazing, service from check-in to executive lounge was top notch and I had a nice suite room, that had a living area and a sleeping area with a nice bathroom, but if you are over 6 foot 6 inches you could be hitting your head on everything.

They do have a contract with a bus company that will take you to one of the two airports and I went to NRT and that cost me about 3100 Yen. It took a little extra then the train because you had to stop at 3-4 places before it got on the highway. The ride is at least 60-70 mins away.

They did have a shuttle bus, but we never used it; it stops in front of the Keio department store, but we had trouble finding it upon arrival, so we just walked.

The executive lounge for the happy hour has a separate Gold & Diamond lounge which is more intimate and well stocked. Rotating food options each day so no overlap at least on our three nights.

1,REDACTED,en,1068,"We stayed here 2 nights. As diamond, we were upgraded to the basic suite - separate bedroom and lounge room.

The hotel is about 15 mins walk from Shinjuku station - it is near the Hyatt Regency (next door) and the Government building (for views over Tokyo - however, when we were there it rained and was cloudy so we did not check it out). Hotel has a shuttle bus to the station where there are a lot of shops, restaurants and one department store.

While the rooms were good size - good king bed, the bathroom was rather dark and the bathtub was short but deep (my sister who has been to Japan many times said this was normal as Japanese people prefer a deep bath). Wifi OK.

We had breakfasts on the 2nd floor restaurant one day and on the ground floor restaurant another day. Both have similar choices, but the one the ground floor had better selection and more things.

We only visited the executive lounge once (the other day we had a long ride on the shinkansen to Hokkaido for the day - when we were back, the lounge was closed). We were taken to another smaller and less crowded room (said to be especially for diamond members!). The food was OK - not sure if it was the same as the one in the other more crowded room.

We went to the Gyoen Park one day - via subway. It was very quick. The park was beautiful with lots of blossoms.",4,2016/04/17
1,REDACTED,en,1069,Quality Hilton next to Shinjuku Park. Airport limousine bus provides good access from Narita airport at a sensible price. Taxi for the same journey is costly. Hotel quality is what you would expect from a Hilton in a major city. Room was very clean and well equipped. Wifi available throughout. Speed on the complementary service was adequate for email and general browsing. Restaurant service round the clock. A la carte prices typically high for this type of hotel and location.

The location is perfect and the hotel has its own shopping facility in B1 and covered connection to both the Marunouchi and Oedo lines.

1,REDACTED,en,1072,"Very impressive Very International . Timeless Downtown Metropolitan Style. 
My 9 night stay was complicated and very busy yet the seamless consistent reliability of Tokyo City Hilton Asset virtually took my breath away !

Congratulations to this Hotel it surpasses every expectation rewarded me as a guest at every turn. 

I took suite for 4 nights at the beginning and when I returned from snowboarding Zao Onsen without friend took a standard superior room both were on high floors. The suite was stylish warm and comfortable, the superior was perfectly adequate and without problem.

The Executive lounge for professionals in 5 star perks was simply stunning with an array of suitably qualified individuals both linguistically and good character. As I had already spent 4 nights in a suite i retained my exec lounge privileges for the second part of my stay even when only taking a superior room. Now that's looking after you and exceeding expectations!

My trip complications attempt to alter negatively my time in Japan failed to break through and it was that Wall of luxury and security and overall functionality yet with warmth and other suitable polishes that made ""One intense crazy trip"" A trip of a lifetime, I try to visualize having stayed anywhere else ... I cannot. 

It was a variety of weather conditions to wake up to which was illuminating and well catered to by Hilton. One morning we woke up to a cold snowy morning, from level 37 it was a spectacular sight and brought with it interesting local challenges. Another so crisp and clear that MT FUGI was right there in the exec lounge window frame . Such a powerful backdrop. See pics. 
I had an adequate and good breakfast in executive lounge all but the last morning when I had the main lobby breakfast which was also excellent. 

I loved that they serve ""Ashbrook Estate"" west Australian wines. High quality fine tasting wine. Shiraz and Semillon to die for! Wine worth hunting for! (it is illusive and rare in the Australian retail market)

The Hilton - Shinjuku Hotel Shuttle was faultless precise and fun I talked with a lot of like minded guests all unanimous on the quality of service and facilities we were experiencing at Hilton Tokyo. 

Anyone who's going to make a complaint here is going to make a complaint everywhere so don't listen to them. everything cant be brand new all the time though as long as it is well maintained and this place most certainly is !

It is a stay that lives on with me ( this is rare) and I am driven by the experience to return .

1,REDACTED,en,1073,"Hotel is pricey but is in a good location. Service was excellent. As a Hilton Diamond, I was taken up to the executive lounge to check in. I was upgraded to a comfortable executive level room with great views of the city. Spacious room and bathroom - very clean. 
Breakfast on 2nd floor (free for Diamond and Gold) was huge and very tasty with Western and Japanese dishes.
Fitness center was more than adequate with cardio machines, free weights, weight machines, stretching studio, locker rooms, jacuzzi and sauna (in each locker room), as well as indoor pool.
I had some laundry done and it was returned quickly.
My only complaint is that the bed was too firm.
Hotel sits on top of shopping (convenience stores) and is 5 min walk to the subway and 12 min walk to major train station Shinjuku. Would stay again!",5,2016/04/14
1,REDACTED,en,1074,"The hotel is very close from the shinjuku station, but I never got to walk from the shinjuku station to the hotel. (the roads were somehow very confusing to me) 

The hoteliers were very attentive and kind, and I was able to check in with ease. The lobby is quite spacious, but due to the flock of tourists in the lobby (checking in and checking out) it was crowded and not many seats to rest.

The room (like many other hotels in Tokyo) was not very spacious. I had a not so bad view, but due to the location of the hotel, there isn't that much of a view to start with.

Hotel amenities were identical to the ones you see in many other hilton hotel joints. A brand I do not like that much. 

The breakfast I chose to have was on the 2nd floor buffet, which was tremendously large and with a vast menu to choose from. Somewhat tiresome to get around. (jokingly speaking) The second morning I tried out the japanese restaurant, that served me bento of Japanese food. I didn't have to move one bit, and liked it much better than the buffet. Totally a personal choice. 

All in all. I would go to this hotel again, for the price is good, and the services that follow meet the standards. But if you want to woe or impress someone... this would not be the hotel I would choose.

Although the location of the hotel is about fifteen minutes walking distance to the shopping areas, it is very pedestrian friendly. There is also a complimentary hotel shuttle to the city center which made it convenient during cooler weather. The convenient train station underneath the hotel allowed us to venture to other parts of Japan. 

Front desk and concierge staff are friendly and helpful at every turn. There was a variety of western and Asian items for breakfast dining. It was an absolutely fabulous experience being surrounded by a clean and beautiful environment. Servers were dedicated to making our dining experience truly memorable. 

Our room had a wonderful view of the city. It was clean and well-maintained. The beds and bedding were comfortable and smelled fresh. Yes, we will definitely stay at this hotel again!!",5,2016/04/14
1,REDACTED,en,1076,"I stayed at the Hilton recently for a few nights. I had previously stayed at the Hyatt just across the road and was thoroughly impressed. However, as it was fully booked I went for the Hilton this time.

The service at the front desk and bellhops was just OK, but not as warm as I had expected. The only exception I would say was the friendly tour desk guy (don't recall his name now). 

Housekeeping was definitely subpar. They took away my in-room coffee cups(multiple days) and didn’t provide new ones until I called; toilet amenities were not replaced adequately. There was a chocolate spot on the table from something I had eaten earlier and left in a hurry. Housekeeping conveniently cleaned around it but missed the big spot. It took me all but a few seconds to wipe it off with a cloth. If I had to rate the housekeeping I would give the hotel a 2 star rating, considering the class of hotel. 

Room service prices were exorbitant but the portions tiny. I don’t mind paying, but the portion should be worth it. 

The hotel is in a fantastic location with an underground passage straight to the Tokyo metro(Nishi-Shinjuku station), which is very useful. The Shinjuku garden is also a few meters away and is a hassle free way to see the Cherry Blossoms. It has a shrine as well which is not as crowded as the other famous ones. There is a 24 hours Denny's just across the street if you want to avoid the room service. The other thing I like about this area is that although its a stone throw away from the lively Kabukicho and Shinjuku station areas, its still very quiet and peaceful. The free wifi was adequate and I didn't need to upgrade to the paid/faster one.",3,2016/04/13

Great choice and good value.",5,2016/04/11
1,REDACTED,en,1082,"This is definitely a high end hotel, BUT if you're booking this hotel because they can get you good dinner reservations, there are better and cheaper ways to do that. 

We enjoyed our stay, but were very frustrated when it took the concierge several hours to get back to us with a dinner reservation. During this time, they weren't returning our calls and we felt like we were imposing on them so we gave up, which was not a good feeling. But eventually, they called us back with a reservation at a great restaurant that we had to rush to, but it was worth it!

During this process, out of frustration, I got in touch with a service that charges $35 to help tourists get reservations at top restaurants, and they responded within 5 minutes with an incredible Michelin star restaurant for the very next day. The Hilton concierge chastised us, saying that we needed to reserve the top places a month in advance (we had actually asked them a month in advance to help with a Jiro reservation that they were unable to get), and yet this other service called go-voyagin got us a reservation super fast. Go-voyagin called me with a place within 5 minutes of my initial request, versus 2+ hours from the Hilton concierge. It would be more cost effective to stay at a cheaper hotel and use one of these services than to stay here and deal with an overwhelmed and busy concierge. 

There were other great things about this hotel, which is why I still give 4 stars. We got a 2PM late checkout as being part of HHonors, and we were able to keep our bags in their storage for an extra night as we did some traveling. Staff speaks great English, and was helpful telling us how to get around the city.",4,2016/04/10

To get to the hotel get to Shin juku station and take the shuttle from bus stop 21 (every 12-15 mins) or it is a 10-15 minute walk. The check in was efficient (we had Kent who was very friendly)and the rooms were so clean and we were all provided with slippers and night coats. They had the extra bed put in before we arrived for our son! the bathroom with the heated toilet seat is amazing!! The Wi-Fi was perfect (according to our son) and the breakfast was very extensive and good- though you could get a cheaper version just a couple of blocks away.
The park nearby (1-2 blocks) is worth walking through and the hotel provides bicycles to hire at reasonable rates. Tokyo itself is an amazing vibrant city that is busy but respectful and decent- despite the traffic we never heard a single horn go off and it is ever so clean. There are lots of things to do and a rail pass is really the way to go- one of our most fun family holidays and it started in Tokyo.",4,2016/04/09

The restaurants offered onsite are really good as well. The only negative was the checkin process. It took close to 30 minutes to complete the process and after traveling all day I just really wanted to get to my room. Other than that, it was fantastic.

1,REDACTED,en,1087,"I spent a week at the Hilton Tokyo both for work and leisure. This is a busy hotel, there is always a swirl of people coming and going from the lobby. There is a mall below the street level that can be easily accessed via the hotel. There is a free shuttle to and from the hotel that takes you to the major shopping district. If you would like to take your chance on the massive subway and train system you can access that too behind the building. Needless to say you have a multitude of options for getting around. There are many restaurants and various price points within walking distance (across the street and below the street level). Starbucks is across the street too.

What's good?
- As a solo female traveler safety is always at top of mind and I felt perfectly safe coming and going on my own at various hours walking around the neighborhood of the hotel location and exploring
- there are plenty of good food options from Japanese fusion, Italian, and western within the hotel. they have a nice bar with leather winged-back chairs and they make a good Manhattan. there are even more options for food at all price points outside within walking distance from the hotel.
- there are many modes of transportation easily accessible for getting around town right outside the lobby doors
- the rooms are clean and updated (i would say semi quiet--i could hear people open and close their doors, but i did not hear talking)
- my room had a good view of the city skyline
- Chocolate vendor in the lobby so daily access to decadent high quality chocolate treats are right there
- 2nd floor restaurant and bar options are a nice quiet getaway from hustle and bustle of the lobby activities

Where there is room for improvement...
- service--no one volunteered to help with anything i had to seek out service, the hotel representatives although they tried to appear nice really were not and left you feeling you were bothering them. (i've been walking in the rain can i borrow and umbrella?)
- they clearly need more staff to manage the high volume crowds at the service desks
- room service -- it took 10 minutes to get someone who could actually speak clear enough English to take my order
- instead of quickly checking me into my room the front desk representative tried several times to sell me an upgrade my room when all i wanted to do after a long flight and two hour drive in the rain was to get to my bed
- i would suggest to keep the noise volume down in the lobby area that they create a great division (wall) between the open restaurant area and the front lobby. it tried eating at the restaurant near the lobby and it was to distracting and noisy. (i suggest eating on the 2nd floor for better experience)",3,2016/04/08
1,REDACTED,en,1088,"We visited the Hilton Tokyo in March/April 2016. We were a group of 8 people travelling together from Hong Kong.

On the whole a good stay at Hilton Tokyo. The position of the hotel is excellent, located in Shinjuku and within easy walking distance to the train station, as well as having underground access via the Hotel lobby. The area around the hotel is seemingly quiet, but still has a great energy. There are many excellent restaurants within easy walking distance, highly recommended to ask the front desk for suggestions.

We stayed on both the 27th floor and the 37th floor, as we had club access. Our room on the 27th floor was lovely, modern, and looked to be recently renovated. Great views and sufficient space for a short stay in the city. Our room on the 37th floor, being on club level was surprisingly not as modern/renovated, the bathroom being far older to the room on the 27th floor. Bit disappointing considering this floor is exclusively for those who have paid extra for Club Access. 

The Exec Club is lovely, well appointed and with great views. The service we received from staff in the lounge was excellent, giving us advise on restaurants, sites and even making dinner reservations for us. It was a great experience. We had drinks there every night of our stay and were pleasantly surprised by the choice of food and drinks on offer. 

We had breakfast (included in our stay) at Marble Lounge on the 1st floor a couple of times. Although having to wait for a table to seat our party, the breakfast is very well appointed, and we all enjoyed it. 

Prior to arrival, we received excellent service from the Concierge, with regards to booking transfers from the airport to the hotel, dinner on arrival and advice on sites to see during our stay.

However the service in general was not great, and not what was expected of a 5 Star Hotel. We arranged a week in advance for an airport transfer to take 8 people and luggage from the hotel to Narita airport. It was confirmed with the front desk on the morning of departure. Our full party arrived in the lobby with luggage to await the arrival only to be told after standing outside for 20min, that the car service company even though having confirmed the transfer did not have any cars. And it turns out the hotel did not confirm the transfer on the day of departure. We were also misinformed about the time it would take to get to the airport, and after much back and forth had taxi's arranged for us at the price of the transfer. We almost missed our flights, and after such a great holiday it was a disappointing way to end, and something which had the hotel service been as it should have been easily avoided.

Marina and Sophie from the front desk, were excellent both prior and during our stay and we thank them for their great hospitality and service. 

We had someone in our party with many years of in-house hospitality service, including Guest Relations, who made the comment of ""service you would expect from a trainee"" is one we sadly agree with.",3,2016/04/07

1,REDACTED,en,1091,"This is a very good hotel with nice decor and generally friendly, helpful staff. Our complaint centers around a fouled-up online reservation system at hilton.com. In January I made and subsequently modified a reservation for an executive junior suite for four nights for the first week of April. When we arrived at the hotel after a long train ride from Kyoto, we found that the hotel had us booked for a deluxe twin for only three nights. This was the original reservation before modifications. Luckily I saved all the paperwork regarding this reservation, and it clearly showed that I had indeed booked a jr. executive suite for four nights. The receptionist and her manager tried very hard to resolve this situation. But because it was peak cherry-blossom time, no jr. executive suites were available for four consecutive nights. Unfortunately the solution involved changing rooms twice, but for three of four nights we were upgraded to first a city suite for one night then a tower suite for the last two nights. My strong recommendation is to save and bring with you to the hotel all the correspondence regarding your reservation, especially if you have made any modifications.",4,2016/04/06

Very attentive staff overall - especially Ernesto who checked us in - and the breakfast is fine too, even though on a couple of mornings it was a bit of a scrum with so many people there. 
Ten minutes walk to (large and a bit chaotic!) Shinjuku station so very well located for areas other than Shinjuku itself. 
Would recommend it if a large chain hotel is what you're after.",4,2016/04/05
1,REDACTED,en,1095,"Another stay at this benchmark Hilton, this time with my wife for her Birthday trip. 

We stayed in a King Tower Executive Suite & it was perfect. Modern, subtle, comfortable. Thank you Hilton Tokyo team for the HHonors Diamond/Birthday recognition. 

The executive lounge, whilst busy, was its usual model of efficiency & a welcome retreat after a hectic journey or day out in Tokyo. Every staff member we encountered was efficient & helpful. The concierge team met all requests as efficiently as always.

I will return to this hotel as it has become my benchmark for Hilton globally - possibly eclipsing The Millennium Hilton Bangkok as my all-time favourite. Why would I stay anywhere else? I won’t!",5,2016/04/04
1,REDACTED,en,1096,Hosue-keeping service was terrible. We got 7 sets of towels but no other amenities for the 1st night. No bathroom amenities again for the 2nd night and had to call them to bring amenities to us. We were told that we might have to pay for extra Nespresso capsules for the coffee machine in our room. Some of the bell desk people were not wiling to help. I asked the bell assistant to tie up a courier box for me but he told me to do it myself as he didn't know how to tie it!!! Concierge was ok most of the time but gave us wrong information regarding the Shinjuku Gyoen. Quality of food was disappointing at breakfast.,2,2016/04/04
1,REDACTED,en,1097,"Hilton Tokyo is centrally located in Shinjuku, the high-end business area in Tokyo, and it's a high quality hotel itself. I stayed nearly a week at this hotel, and really enjoyed my stay.

I arrived very early in the morning, so they registered me, told me even what room I was getting (#2714) and took my luggage promising to deliver it to my room as soon as the room was ready. Later that evening, when I got back to the hotel, they just gave me the card keys. Make sure to keep the card key jacket as it usually has information regarding corporate discount, which comes in handy when you have to pay for breakfast.

Speaking if breakfast, it was excellent. It had a full complement of choices for Japanese, Chinese, European, and American type breakfasts. They all were of top quality. They also had a coffee station where you could get a cup of coffee to go. It can get crowded mid-morning, though, so try going earlier if possible.

My room on the 27th Floor had a lovely view over Shinjuku and further the rest of Tokyo. It was very quiet, with perfect sound proofing. The Wi-Fi worked great, and the room had everything for doing work on your laptop, from a comfy desk to a comfy chair. 

The bed was very comfortable, and the lighting choices were excellent. There were enough outlets to charge. The bathroom had every convenience, including a heated toilet seat, which is not common in the West. The toiletries were the standard Hilton choices.

There were a number of restaurants, as well as pastry and chocolate stores at the hotel. On the second floor, a jazz band performed in the evenings, and they were quite good. The Hilton Tokyo hotel is linked to Hiltopia, an underground shopping arcade with a great variety of restaurants and stores. One of the restaurants there specialized in Unagi (eel), and it was excellent.

The hotel has a free shuttle that goes to Shinjuku station every twenty minutes. There are always taxis available outside the hotel as well.

The concierge is very knowledgeable and helpful. The elevator area in the lobby smells fantastic with what appears to be a white tea and ginger smell that is specific to really high-end Asian hotels, such as The Langham in Hong Kong.
Overall, this is a lovely hotel, and a very dependable choice. I would stay here again, and am happy to recommend it to all.",5,2016/04/03
1,REDACTED,en,1098,"This hotel was fantastic! Because of our gold status, we got upgraded to the top floor of the hotel in a corner room that was wonderful. The room was extremely clean and housekeeping did a fantastic job of replenishing everything each day. My only complaint about the room was that the bathroom seemed very crowded compared to the rest of the room. I feel like they could have taken a touch of space from the bedroom and put it in the bathroom. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and all spoke English. They helped us with directions, buying stamps, navigating the subway and anything else we needed. The hotel is within walking distance to some things and they also offer a shuttle bus to Shinjuku station so that you can easily get around to via the subway. Taxis are also readily available. 

The hotel offers breakfast buffet style only, no a la carte. The second floor breakfast is for Hilton Honors members only and that was less crowded than the larger one in the lobby restaurant. The steakhouse is fantastic on property and the service was impeccable. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel for a trip to Tokyo. It was in a good location, great service and staff and very clean. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2016/04/03
1,REDACTED,en,1099,"We stayed 6 nights in this hotel for our honeymoon and had an excellent stay! Located in central Shinjuku, the hotel has numerous food and beverage choices, a 5-minute walk to the Nishi-Shinjuku station and has a 24-hour convenience store right below. We opted to stay in a Junior suite as the standard rooms were a little tight. The room was clean and comfortable and we enjoyed the Nespresso machine, which were refilled with capsules daily. 

Two months prior to our visit, we had gotten in touch with the concierge to request for assistance in making restaurant reservations. Concierge staff Yuki, Kumi, Yusuke, and Kohta were quick to respond and were able to make recommendations on other restaurants that might interest us. Front office staff Hiroyuki gave us a warm welcome and was most helpful. Yoshimi and Uranishi in the club lounge were most friendly and accommodating -- they all went the extra mile in making sure we had a pleasant and comfortable stay. We will certainly return on our next visit!",5,2016/04/03

1,REDACTED,en,1104,"I stayed here as a couple in March for our last night in Japan. I wish we could have stayed longer! We had been traveling around Japan on a JR Rail pass and decided to stay in Shinjuku for our last night after staying in Hiroshima the night before. The Shinjuku Station is quite close to the hotel, about a 10 minute walk, however it was raining, we had luggage and we decided to take a taxi. There is a free shuttle bus, going every 20 minutes to and from the hotel but I was not sure how to find it. Shinjuku Station is like a city in itself so we decided on the easy option of a taxi. Taxi drivers in Japan are lovely and never seem annoyed by a cheap fare so I would recommend a taxi to get your bearings if you arrive by train. We took the shuttle bus back to the station the next day and the driver grabbed our luggage for us and took it out again when we got there. With a smile. There are smiles all round at the Hilton. As soon as we arrived, we we escorted to a check in desk, no waiting and the gentleman who checked us in offered us a better room than I chose on the Hilton App that morning. We stayed in a Queen room, on a high floor and had a beautiful view of the city. The room was immaculately clean and the bed was very comfortable and more than big enough for two biggish Aussies. I loved the kimono robes. I especially love the Hilton mirrors in the bathrooms. There is a magnified mirror which makes putting make-up on super easy and there is plenty of light. The colours of the room were relaxing and you can sit right up close to the window and watch over the city. The staff were exceptionally friendly, especially our English concierge who took our luggage up to the room and helped us find the Godzilla Head later on our walk into Kabukicho. She gave us a booklet with a map on it and her directions were spot on. It's a short, safe and fun walk to the red light area of Kabukicho. Afterwards, we had some delicious drinks in the Hilton Zatta Bar. The bar has an ambient red glow and they served some delicious pecans with our drinks. Totally chillaxing. Apart from the bar, we sadly didn't get a chance to try the restaurants or room service. I did buy some Hilton chocolates down stairs to take home. There are heaps of shops nearby, not just the high end shops you expect near a Hilton (Hiltopia shopping arcade under the Hotel) but 100 yen shops and convenience stores just up the road. We had a late flight the next day and were given a complimentary late check-out. Also free bottled water and internet. I even received a nice email from the Guest Relations Manager when I got back to Australia. This hotel knows customer service! Thank you Tokyo Hilton, we felt like rockstars and it was the perfect end to our Japan adventure!",5,2016/04/01
1,REDACTED,en,1105,"My wife and I stayed here for fours nights recently. The location is a little out the way, but the shuttle bus which is free runs every 20 minutes and is very handy for travel to and from the Shinjuku train station. The breakfast is very good and the shops below the hotel are worth looking at along with the restaurants. Seven bank also has an atm for use of non Japanese issued credit cards when you need some cash. We were extremely impressed with the service and manners of all staff. A young English staff member by the name of Sophie was particularly helpful in the wrapping of a gift we bought for a Japanese friend. The hotel is not cheap, but you are in Japan, so good accomodation is costly. Highly recommended if you are travelling to Tokyo.",5,2016/04/01
1,REDACTED,en,1106,"Spent four nights here with the family in March of 2016. It's centrally located, within easy walking distance of Shinjuku station, and even closer to the Nishi-Shunjuku stop on the Marunouchi subway line. The Hilton is also served by the ""friendly airport limousine"" (actually a coach) directly from Narita. A very easy way to get into the city from the airport without dropping a couple of hundred bucks on a taxi.

The breakfast buffet was very adequate, and in line with what you would pay at a business hotel in any other world capital. All in all not a bad place to get your bearings in Tokyo.

As you would expect from Hlton, it's dependable, clean, professionally staffed, and a bit bland. But sometimes, Bland is just what you're looking for. We found it a good base to explore Shinjuku and the surrounding areas. (Two stops take you to the Shibuya shopping district, for example). 

If you stay here, be sure to walk over to the famous (notorious?) ""Memory lane"" --- Google that and you'll get its other, more colorful name as well. Anyway, lots of tiny little old shops selling beer and yakitori, some grilled on charcoal, some over butane. In any case, competition is fierce, an the yakitori is both delicious and inexpensive.

So, interesting district, good dependable hotel, and good transportation. You could do far worse here.",4,2016/03/31
1,REDACTED,en,1107,"Just returned from a four night trip to Japan at the Hilton Tokyo and could not have been happier. Great location in Shinjuku in central Tokyo. 

This hotel is close to dining and shopping and the Shinjuku Station. The hotel also offers a complimentary shuttle to and from the station throughout the day. The neighborhood is clean and safe at all hours of the day and night. 

We had a great experience with the service at the Hilton Tokyo. From check in, to the restaurants, and the executive lounge. Everyone speaks English and is incredibly polite, helpful and efficient. The front desk and concierge were especially helpful with maps, guides, and directions and suggestions on where to eat. 

The hotel is modern with oriental touches throughout. Room was cleaned very well daily and there was good WiFi in the rooms & public areas.

I wanted to compliment the first floor restaurant during breakfast. We were greeted by name daily and the staff was constantly refilling the myriad breakfast options and freshening our cappuccino. 

The Hilton Tokyo has shuttles to the Haneda and Narita airports. Plan for 1 hour to Haneda, 1 1/2 - 2 hours on the bus from the Hilton to Narita.

We travel quite a bit and have already booked our return trip at the Hilton Tokyo for December and can't wait for another great experience.

Room Tip: Executive Lounge access rooms gives you additional amenities and a great view of Mount Fuji on a clear day.",5,2016/03/30
1,REDACTED,en,1108,"It's clean and comfortable. But I had a bit of a problem with the lady at the front desk. I am a platinum member and am entitled to access to the executive lounge and free breakfast and a free upgrade but was denied all three!

1,REDACTED,en,1109,"I've stayed at this hotel three different times for business trips as it is close to the office of my client in Shinjuku. It is also walking distance to shopping, restaurants and lots of other attractions. The rooms are large by Tokyo standards and are comfortable if a bit basic. The breakfast (served in the lobby) is also very good. This hotel perfectly meets my needs for business travel.",5,2016/03/28

In quiet government neighborhood area 7 min walk from the major train station at Shinjuku, which connects well to Narita via N'Ex. See the nearby Shinjuku neighborhood for big crowds, lots of neon and people watching, shopping, and fantastic eating in alleyways full of yakitori bars, grilling tasty sticks of meats in tiny bars. Eat with local salarymen drinking after work! Close to gardens and Meiji Shrine.",5,2016/03/28
1,REDACTED,en,1112,"Wonderful location - in Shinjuku (specifically Nishishinjuku) which is centrally located in Tokyo. This hotel is close to several subway stops & the Shinjuku Station. It was easy to get around Tokyo with this hotel as a starting point. (But know - getting around Tokyo can be challenging. Several different subways/railways and very busy pretty much all the time. It took us a couple of days to get the hang of it. But - the station attendants were helpful. Once you know what platform your train departs from, you are good to go!) 

There's plenty to see and do within a 10 - 15 minute walk from the hotel (sightseeing - gardens, samurai museum, shopping, restaurants). Safe & very clean neighborhood.

Service is amazing at the Hilton Tokyo. Everyone speaks English and is incredibly polite, helpful and efficient. The front desk and concierge were especially helpful with directions and suggestions on where to eat (too many choices; we had a difficult time narrowing down the list on our own).

The hotel is modern and our rooms (executive lounge access room) were enormous by any standards but especially in Japan. Rooms were well equipped (complimentary water, Nespresso machine, ice machine on each floor), clean, comfortable. It was nice to have the large space to spread out and relax. Good WiFi in the rooms & public areas too.

The Hilton Tokyo is quite busy; it seems to be very popular (for good reason). Many tours pick up from this hotel so the lobby is crowded and busy every morning and evening. And while there's quite a bit of hustle and bustle, we were surprised at how efficient everything was including the elevator access. The hotel has complimentary shuttles to the Shinjuku station (but only a 15 minute walk) and has a shuttle service to both Tokyo airports. Plan for 1.5 - 2 hours on the bus from the Hilton to Narita.

Take the time to have a cocktail in the St. George's bar. Classic style bar with live music and great cocktails (both classic and original creations by the bartenders). The service was excellent and even the bar food offering was very good!

We travel quite a bit and rarely like to stay in the same hotel twice. But this one - is a definite return for us. Loved it!",5,2016/03/27
1,REDACTED,en,1113,"We stayed here for 4 days together with my kids. It's a good choice because it's near Disneyland and DisneySea about 1-2 mins to monorail. Theres a Disney bus that constantly roam around the area. Staff's are all accomodating check in was a breeze, I forgot the name of the receptionist but he's so attentive with my needs. We booked the happy magic room, and my kids love it so much, the design is really catchy for kids eyes the room is spacious with 3 beds and 1 pull bed and I requested a crib for my baby, we all fit so well, it's really indeed a Happy magic room. Housekeeping are good and always on time.
This hotel is good for those really wanted just to spend time at Disneyland, it's quite isolated, no other things to do outside the hotel, that's why we ate at the resto within the hotel and it's quite expensive but there's a convenience store and a bread store also located inside the hotel.
What's important is that my kids love it and it's so near that they can all rest right away and no need to travel far",4,2016/03/27

The International staff were very friendly, welcoming and accommodating, we loved the private breakfast setup on the 2nd floor away from the other diners, this was a HHonors benefit and great breakfast and personal chef. 

As mentioned there is a complimentary shuttle bus to Shinjuku that runs every 30 mins and it runs to the second, don't be late. 

Great hotel, tad pricey but worth it.",5,2016/03/26

The positives: The hotel is bright and very clean with excellent service. The breakfast buffet is awesome - a huge selection of American, Japanese, Chinese offerings and a great value if you have it included in your room rate. The hotel runs a shuttle to the train station every 20 minutes. It's a 5 minute ride otherwise a 15 minute walk.
The negatives: wifi in the room is only good for 3 devices, so with 4 in the room, we had to negotiate for who could be online!",4,2016/03/26

Stayed four nights (two adults, one teenager and a six year old) and were lucky to be upgraded on arrival The room was awesome!Even had a good view of Mt. Fuji one morning when the sky was clear.

We tried both the Hotel's steak house/ grill and room service for dinner one night. Both worked well, but thats a seperat review :-)

The breakfast buffet was really good. A lot of different choices and not overly crowded.

Check- in/out was fast and spot on. No mistakes.

Shuttle bus to the airport worked great as well.

The hotel is conviniently located in Shinjuku - close to one of the busiest train stations in Tokyo and a nice shopping district. From here easy access to everywhere! 

The standard of Hilton is always good. However, Hilton Tokyo managed to take it up a level.

Seldom have we all felt so welcome and as special guests as we did - dispite having hundreds of rooms and thousands of guests. Thanks for a great stay!

Requested an early check in on arrival at hotel and although our rooms were unavailable another was made available at a reduced cost. Cots in rooms were large and sturdy and at all times the children were made to feel very welcome in the hotel. Hotel facilities were excellent and the airport bus to and from the hotel was both convenient and easy to use. We ate in the hotel for both nights and although very expensive the food was extremely good. We were allowed a late check out for a late flight out which was greatly appreciated as it meant our children could have their naps before a long haul flight to the UK. Having stayed at another Hilton elsewhere and it being a very mediocre experience, I was really pleased to have such wonderful service and experiences at this one.

Location: 2 minutes to a mini station and 12 minutes to main shinjuku station, very convenient. We are also close to a shopping block that made dining very easy

Hotel not as fancy as we expected but that OK. Reception area a bit small given the size of the hotel so check in can be a bit of a zoo.

Turned out that a store in the basement (unaffiliated with the hotel I believe) was the best place we found to buy china stuff in Tokyo.

Our main reason to go to that hotel was that it's supposed to be in Shinjuku, but alas one needs to take their shuttle to get there, which kind of defeated our purpose.",4,2016/03/24

We can't thank her enough for all her help. Throughout our stay, we were always treated with a very personal touch - nothing being too much trouble for the staff.

But since we arrived a tad early, our room is not yet ready, so went out to Shinjuku Train Station for a walk. Hotel provide complimentary shuttle bus to Shinjuku Station, which take 20 mins round trip.

My impression of hotels in Japan were small, cramped and you hardly have any space to turn in the toilet - but not in Hilton Tokyo (esp the Jr Suite). There are more than ample space in the room for the kids to hop around, and the toilet, thought not as big as I hoped for, it's not small by any standard either (definitely better than what I had in my impression).

Buffet breakfast-although the quality is very good, but I got bored on the 3rd day - apart from the swap between fried rice/noodle, the item served for the 6 days I'm there were exactly identical.

Despite the hotel location among the skyscraper in Shinjuku, the area was surprisingly quiet with hardly any noticeable traffic (apart from the train station) - no neon light of any sort yet it is only 10 mins shuttle from all the action.

Since it's not exactly near the train station, and there's up to 20 minutes wait for the next shuttle bus, do consider when you intend to do some heavy shopping ;)",4,2016/03/20

The free wi-fi was reliable and easy to connect. There is a fridge, a kettle, and a safe in the room. The room was spacious with twin beds. Bathroom had a combined bath and shower. It also had the amazing Japanese toilet with a seat warmer, deodorizer, and spray functions. We were also provided with complimentary bottles of water each day.

I also had the daily buffet breakfast option at the Marble Lounge on the ground floor which was a great way to start the day. There was quite a wide variety of Western and Asian options in the buffet. Buffet started at 6:30 am but on the day of the marathon, they started an hour earlier at 5:30 am which was really handy.

There is a free bus shuttle, which I found to be quite useful, between the hotel and Shinjuku station which runs every 20 minutes. I had also taken the paid bus shuttle from Haneda airport to the hotel on my arrival and from the hotel to Narita airport on my departure.

There was a handy convenience store, the Quality Store, in the basement level of the hotel.

The hotel itself is absolutely fantastic, with very modern, well appointed rooms (we were in an executive King room - 28th floor with amazing views of the city). Breakfast buffet is also excellent with a great choice and comfortable seating. What I want to emphasise however is the quality of the staff. Every single person that we came across is warm,polite, always with a great smile and wanting to help. This has made our stay very special and definitely makes this hotel world class. Finally it's location is ideal for any outings as it's a 10 minute walk to Shinjuku Station (or 5 minute ride on the free shuttle), where you can connect to any part of the city.

Our room was really good. We paid for the Executive level and had access to the Executive Lounge, which was nice and it had views of Mt Fuji so we enjoyed many free drinks watching the sun setting and Mt Fuji changing colours. The buffet breakfast was also pretty good and offered lots of Japanese options which we liked, rather than all Western. 

The mattress in our room was pretty hard, so we asked if they could do something about it. Not sure what they did, but it was fine for the remaining nights. This was consistent with the level of service generally, which was high.

If you are a marathon runner, do the Tokyo marathon. It was the best organised event we have ever been in, and the crowd support was unbelievable. There are free buses from the marathon end point back to Shinjuku.",5,2016/03/18

The room was huge, with awesome city views. The breakfast in the lounge is very good abs they appear to have added seating since my last trip. Staff was very friendly and helpful. I will return!",5,2016/03/15
1,REDACTED,en,1134,"We took airport limousine bus from Narita Airport and they dropped us right in front of the hotel. Very convenient as we were travelling with an infant.

As a Hhonors Hold member our room.got upgraded to Executive Floor. Well appointed rooms with modern touch. Love it... The bathroom is simple yet elegant with standing shower and bathtub. 

It's a busy hotel and heard about their legendary strawberry hi-tea however we didn't get a chance to try them.

Breakfast at the Marble restaurant was super good. One of the best bfast spread ever comparing with other Hilton Hotels in Tokyo which I have visited. Prompt service from the team.

Thank you to Haruna-san and her team for looking after us.",5,2016/03/15
1,REDACTED,en,1135,"We stayed there for 5 days as part of a tour group during the Tokyo Marathon.
We arrived in the morning and were told nothing would be available until 4pm. Our lugguage was stored and we went for a walk. Had breakfast at Denny's (5 minutes walk) and found many stores and shops closed by. Checked around 2pm and our rooms were ready!! 
The checkin process was a bit slow as the person we were dealing with seemed a bit uncertain as we were part of a group. And there was a lot of paperwork versus the computer system. She was very very nice though.
The room was very nice!! Our room faces the tennis court, so no street noise and the insulation is done very very well with this hotel as we didn't hear our neighbours or people from the hallway at all during our stay. I think this might have to do with earthquake construction measures.
The hotel is right in front of the start line, so the morning of the race, we didn't need to get up early at all!!
As part of our package, we got a buffet breakfast each morning and the selection was great, with western and Japanese choices.
15 minutes walk to the main Shinjuku station and it's also besides the Tochomae and the Nishi-Shinjuku stations. The hotel has a shuttle to Shinjuku that runs every 20 minutes. From the Haneda Airport, we took an airport shuttle direct to the hotel for 12,300¥.
Overall, excellent location to stay, not a lot of action like Shibuya and Ginza though if you like to be in the middle of that as it's more a business area. Concierge was very helpful!",4,2016/03/15
1,REDACTED,en,1136,The King Jr. Suite was an excellent room on 35th floor with great views. Clean and comfortable bedding and pillows. Shower was average. Executive lounge was one of the best I've experienced at any property. Location is good for Shinjuku Station access but further away from some of the sights most people are looking to hit. The restaurants inside the hotel are fine.,5,2016/03/15
1,REDACTED,en,1137,"We were on the 19th floor, and the room was excellent. First time in Japan so the toilet was a bit of a mystery at first (see the attached photo!). From arrival to departure the staff were very helpful and friendly. My wife was impressed with the young lady manning the door, who manoeuvred our over-size luggage with ease. If we return to Tokyo we would stay again without hesitation. It is perfectly placed for the myriad of public transport options in Tokyo.",5,2016/03/14

I was welcomed as a Diamond Member and even got a special visit from the Guest Relations Manager who told me to contact her if I needed anything during my stay. I was offered an upgrade if I wanted, but I turned it down because I wanted a room with a King bed, but it still had an amazing view. The rooms were very comfortable, well maintained and had great views. The staff was literally AMAZING!

I didn't have a suite or an upgraded room, but it was well-designed and quiet and made for restful sleeping. If you are in the Shinjuku part of Tokyo, this is the best hotel I've stayed at!!",5,2016/03/13
1,REDACTED,en,1142,"Location is great. Underground connection to Nishi-Shinjuku station which easily connects you to anywhere in Tokyo via subway and anywhere in Japan via the amazing train system. Shinjuku neighborhood is clean and vibrant. No lack for things to see and do.

The hotel is modern and well maintained. The rooms are also modern in design. The look is sleek and the furniture including the bed were comfortable. However, the closets and accessible drawers (not behind a table and chair) were simply too small and too few to accommodate 2 people with a standard amount of clothes and luggage (2 no extra charge checked bags and 2 carry ons).

The water pressure, temperature, and shower head were very nice but the layout in the shower/tub enclosure is such that the best to place to stand if you are over 5' tall is where the tub wall begins. No amount of up down or left right adjustment made the water come down on the top of my head so it was either over the top, in my face, or in my chest.

We paid extra for access to the Executive Lounge. It was a nice place to sit since most of the furniture in our room had clothes or suitcases sitting on them. The meager selection of food/snack items was disappointing which made the no carry out rule no problem but the no carry in rule made the place less inviting.

The fitness center was fine. They had enough machines to keep the pre marathon crowd happy so I expect they will always be available.

The restaurants were generally good. A breakfast buffet was included in our package and it had good selection and quality. One note for egg eaters, if you don't like runny (uncooked) egg in your omelets or something other than over slightly fried eggs you will need to make that clear.

The staff was courteous and helpful.

Service in Executive Lounge was exceptionally on point, but honestly can be said no matter where you are in the property. Close to trains and well centered in town makes for easy transit both business and pleasure. 
Breakfast should get a shout-out as well, they crush it. If you can't find what you need there, you're not trying.",4,2016/03/10

The bathroom is efficient and well laid out with a shower/tub room separate from the sink/vanity mirror. The Japanese style window shades are great. The room can be made dark or some light can come through. The restaurants are mainly on the 2nd floor and the Japanese one is good. The Hilton is very close to Shinjuku station - where there is lots to see, eat and shop.",4,2016/03/08
1,REDACTED,en,1147,"1. The hotel is easy to get to from Narita and Haneda airports as the airport limousines drive straight into the hotel's driveway. The Japanese system of loading the bags on and off the bus is superbly efficient.
2. The look of hotel rooms have kept up with the times, as I have seen the rooms refurbished over the 10 years. If you want spacious rooms, the Hilton is the place to go.
3. The breakfast has never failed my family and I. From the time my children were toddlers, there is something for everyone. I always purchase the room with breakfast. It is a good deal.
4. Service has also never faltered over the years. I got my room upgrade as a Hilton member. I got to leave my suitcases with the concierge even after I checked out for 2 days. The trust they have in their customers is amazing. 

So would I choose the Hilton if I take another vacation to Tokyo, definitely!",5,2016/03/08
1,REDACTED,en,1148,"This was our first trip to Japan & we opted to splurge a little and chose Hilton for our 3 days stay. We ended up on the 30th floor, which had an awesome view of the downtown area. 
Hotel is located in the Shinjuku area (downtown Tokyo), next to Shinjuku Central Park, & is 5-6 minute drive (hotel shuttle) from Shinjuku Station.
One thing worth mentioning is the staff's professionalism and their willingness to help (thought there is somewhat communications barrier, still they were able to accommodate our requests). 
Overall, the Hilton Tokyo was a great stay and I definitely recommend it.

The rooms are a good size, the location is great (5 min. walk from the buzz of Shinjuku). The breakfast is really excellent with a lot of choice and the room service choice is pretty good. I've not eaten at the restaurants as there are so many good choices close by in Shinjuku and I quite often end up out for dinner with clients.

The gym is OK, not great, but there are also so parks close by to run around so options available.

Overall, compared to so of the shoebox size rooms I've stayed in, in Tokyo, this is easily my favourite.",4,2016/03/05

Staff is helpful, rooms very clean and there is free wireless which is actually good enough to work outside the office very nicely (even my usually slow VPN had no problems at all). The gym is fine, however the swimming pool deserves a bit more care (the water is not so clear...). My room was not big (I was on the 11th floor) but very clean and functional. I have used the restaurants in the hotel and found the sushi one excellent but very expensive! The restaurants in the Hotel are of a very good level but they are expensive - as much as fancy restaurants in Zurich where I live. It is nice to walk around the hotel area. There are many shopping centers and the whole area around Shinjuku becomes traffic free on week end.",5,2016/03/02

Free shuttle to and from Shinjuku station where there is lots of shopping and restaurants. Friendly staff. If you are train travelling is is much easier to arrange with hotel to have your large suitcases shipped to your next hotel. About $20 per bag. We had a full days private with tours by locals which was fantastic. Lots of walking and trips on trains but got to see much more than from a bus. Also had great lunch in local restaurant.,4,2016/03/01

Nothing special.,2,2016/03/01

Having said that, it is hugely convenient that the Airport Limousines, from both Narita and Hakeda, come here directly and also leave from here. The hotel was really busy (perhaps because of the conference?) but my room was nice. At a stretch, one could walk to the malls - Isetan and Takashimaya. The Yoyogi Garden with its Meiji shrine and the interesting Omote Sando street are just a cab ride away. Also, great eating across the street at the Sumitomo building.",4,2016/02/28

Hotel has a shuttle bus for Shinjuku station (departing 12/32/52 from hotel and 00/20/40 from Shinjuku stop 21 outside Keio dept store (west exit)).

The hotel was beautiful, had very friendly staff and our room had an amazing view of Mt. Fuji. The kids thoroughly enjoyed the buffet breakfast and the free shuttle taking you to Shinjuku station made sight seeing much easier.

1,REDACTED,en,1166,"I have found some hotels to be quite off the beaten path in Tokyo. The Hilton Tokyo was quite central and close to Shinjuku and relatively easy to get to.

Check out the general store in the Hiltopia if you're needing something cheap like a late night snack or drinks. Prices were great.

Rooms were quite modern and had fantastic views of Shinjuku. Worth staying at again.",4,2016/02/21
1,REDACTED,en,1167,"I remember the days that Hilton was still 'a name', Hilton, wow! I think that image no longer suffices.

We paid a lot of money for a tiny room. But ok, this is Tokyo that we are talking about.

It was clean, it was sufficient, it did the job, so to speak. But in terms of luxury, design, decor, it was all quite dull, plain and tasteless.

The prices in the most 'common' of their restaurants were outrageous, with almost 10 euros for a mediocre cappuccino.

The staff was ok. They spoke english (badly, but at least they did). They were not the friendliest we ever had.

To be clear: this did not bother us. It did the job, as I said. 

And there were good points:
1. the location in Shinjuku is good and handy
2. they have a shuttle service between hotel and metro station
3. if you want you can also choose to walk to the Shinjuku station. It's a 10 minute walk.
4. there is a Starbucks very nearby; we needed that for our daily coffee-fix!
5. we saw Mount Fuji on clear days",3,2016/02/20
1,REDACTED,en,1168,"Stayed here with my husband and 18year old daughter in a King Junior Suite. She had a rollaway bed which was large and very comfortable. The room is large with massive king bed and lounge area. The bathroom was strangely arranged but beautifully fitted out and adequate for 3 people. There is a privacy screen covering the glass wall to the bedroom outside.
Breakfast is typical of large hotels and more than adequate and delicious. We ate in the Marble Bar a few nights and it is quite expensive but we were too tired from sightseeing to bother going out again.
The check-in staff were lovely and polite and sooo friendly - we even got a free upgrade to an executive room!
The concierge staff were the same, extremely helpful and friendly. The courtesy bus to Shinjuku station is very convenient although we got a taxi on arrival from the airport because we couldn't find the bus stop easily on a dark and cold night.
I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016/02/18
1,REDACTED,en,1169,"We found a very good deal on this hotel through a Japanese online booking agent, and chose this hotel for a three night stay in May.

The staff were polite and friendly.",4,2016/02/17
1,REDACTED,en,1170,"One thing you must understand if you have never visited Tokyo before, Tokyo is one big city, and I think Shinjuku area is the biggest and busiest district in Tokyo. Not to be confused, it has a lot of stations. Fyi, this hotel is located at the quieter side of Shinjuku. So from here to the famous Kabukicho Shinjuku area, will take at least 20 mins by walking (distance approx 1,5km). 

Good thing to know that Hilton has great access of Marunochi and Oedo subway lines - through Nishi-Shinjuku station.
Also, Hilton provides a free shuttle bus to JR Shinjuku station ( pls take note the shuttle bus is not available 24/7 ). 

Hotel is okay, modern normal western type. I believe it is newly renovated in the recent 5 years (not sure). Stayed here for 3 nights, sorry to say I got bored by the breakfast, nothing special. 

To Narita/Haneda Airport, you can easily ride the Airport Limousine Bus (please do reserve in advance).

The hotel is bigger than it looks in photos and has everything accessible at every single hour. I took advantage of the room service daily and it was delicious, everything arrived on time and they never not once made a mistake. The hotel and rooms are very modern, and impeccably clean, more than I expected and so much more than I could have anticipated. The only reason I did not give the hotel 5 stars is because I felt the staff was a little insensitive to the language barrier, everything was offered in english, and front desk members spoke perfect english, but other staff people such a housekeeping and restaurant employees, or bellboys when I was asking for directions or simple information could not help much, made me feel a little bit lost, I do hope they address this.",4,2016/02/16

1,REDACTED,en,1174,"The Hilton Tokyo is always my go to place when I am in town and each and every time I stay I am reminded of why I always come back. This is my third review of this property, I encourage you to take a look at my other reviews which will provide more info.

I have actually lost count of how many times I have stayed here over the last two years or so - this might be because I always feel like I am at home when I am here. This trip was a bit special for me as my cousin who lives in England was joining me and it was her first trip to Tokyo! It was an early morning arrival for her into Haneda which meant after a quick trip on the bus we arrived at the Hilton around 10AM. Fully aware that we were early and check in did not start until 2PM we were just going to drop our bags and go explore a bit of the city until we could come back and check in. Quite unexpectedly a very nice gentleman at the check in counter (who's, quite shamefully and embarrassingly, name I have forgotten except for the fact that it started with a T and he wore a grey suit) invited us to a computer terminal so he could see if there was a room available and if we could get in right away. A very friendly character, he took the time to welcome us, thank me for coming to stay with them again, and even thanked me for one of my previous reviews of the hotel! While he was working on the computer another one of the hotels amazing staff came a long with a cart and put all of our baggage on it so it could quickly be brought to storage or our room. I had booked a Twin Hilton room with a rollaway bed as, along with my cousin and myself, my friend decided to join us as well. The gentlemen who was helping us (again, i'm embarrassed i have forgotten his name) saw that there were the three of us and took a few minutes to look over what was available and much to our surprise and enjoyment advised us that we could be upgraded to a Junior Executive Suite if we were willing to wait as the room was still occupied. Of course we couldn't say no to that! After a quick few keystrokes and some friendly chit chat our bags were whipped away to storage and we agreed on coming back around 3PM to finalize check in and get our room keys. In the mean time it was down to Shibuya for some sightseeing and shopping!

Coming back to the hotel to pick up our room keys was a breeze. Everything was already prepared for us and within 5 minutes of arriving back into the hotel we were on our way to our room. Arriving in the room everything was prepared for the three of us. The room had two twin sized beds plus a couch but they also brought the rollaway in for my friend and had it set up in a very nice spot by the window. A quick call to the concierge to let them know we were there and our bags were being brought up almost instantaneously! The Junior Suites feature the new, modern bathrooms with plenty of amenities, two twin beds, a couch/siting area, a nice wall mounted TV, a place for your luggage, and a reasonable closet to hang jackets in and place your shoes. All rooms also include bathrobes, day robes, slippers, and a safe.

One of my perks with the upgrade, thanks to my HHonors Gold status, was the executive lounge. As I said in my other review if its not too much more to book a room with the executive status it is worth it however I feel that if its quite a bit more you have to take very good advantage of it to make it worth its while. I generally take the chance on an upgrade and so far I've been lucky with about 3 our of 4 stays getting it. After our check in we all freshened up and headed up to the lounge to enjoy some drinks and snacks. We got there just before it transitioned from afternoon tea to evening appetizers so we started out with some sweet snacks and a drink before having gyoza, soba noodles, and other assorted appetizers. The food selection is light, but very good - everything we had was very tasty! The drink selection is also very good with a wide variety including soft drinks, beer, champagne, spirits, and bottled water. The highlight of this experience was one of the employees in the lounge, Naoto. As he was clearing our table of some of the dishes and drinks he took the time to ask us where we were from, what brought us to Tokyo, and if we were enjoying ourselves. When he found out that I worked in the aviation industry we discovered that we share a similar passion in airplanes and aviation! Every time he stopped by to check in on us we would have a quick discussion about things aviation related and this made our entire party feel warm, welcome, and valued. Naoto made our lounge experience go from great to excellent. A very big thank you to Naoto, I hope he can be recognized in some way for his amazing customer service!

Our entire stay at the Hilton Tokyo was, as usual, absolutely fantastic. The housekeeping staff kept our room amazingly clean and fresh, the lobby staff always made us feel warm and welcome, and the concierge desk was a great help in taking our bags up to the room, bringing them down when we departed, and answering our sometimes random questions about where to find things. The upgrade is a bonus and never expected but we still talk about it to this day! While we didn't try the new food options they did look amazing and one of the other guests said their meal was fantastic.

Overall I just have to say it was another amazing stay at my home way from home. I'm staying again on the 17th of February and I can't wait! Thank you to all the staff for treating me and my travel companions so well, see you soon!",5,2016/02/15

1,REDACTED,en,1179,"Back to the Tokyo Hilton after ten years and little has changed. The (spacious) room looked the same and from our large 27th floor window we could look all the way to Shinjuku station (free shuttle bus every twenty minutes). The bathroom is well equipped with amenities (which in Japan always include a tooth brush per person) and comes with a strong shower (in a bath tub). Shiatsu massage is also provided and was really good and worth the ¥8300 price tag.
Free wifi ( which needs to be renewed every day - an unnecessary hassle) and free use of the healthclub (pool; seven tread mills; three cross trainers; limited heavy equipment).
The hotel has several good restaurants and there are more in the basement along with a number of fancy shops and a convenience store.
During our stay there occurred two noticable earth quakes but everybody stayed calm.

First, we had more than enough toiletries provided for us, and the toilets were really clean. We also had special services like a pillow menu and two televisions in our room. There was also a sofa in the room, big enough to fit 4-5 people. 

Pools and hot springs here were also opened till late, 10pm as compared to other hotels. We also could have one last dip in the hot springs after checking out. They also had a tennis court, a relaxation room and a 24hour gym for usage. The hotel also provided a huge variety of food items for their morning breakfast buffet. 

Room service were also very efficient and delivered items quickly. Rooms were also always cleaned up nicely. All in all, if you're looking to enjoy yourself after a long day or touring around, this hotel is definitely recommended. 5/5",5,2016/02/09

The foyer area and the reception desk is very busy but staff do their best to get to everyone. Staff were very polite and professional. It was a comfortable room, very welcome after a long haul flight! So many attractions in Tokyo - where to start!

1,REDACTED,en,1192,"Stayed in Hilton Tokyo yet again and the experience this time was even better. The concierge service was excellent, especially thanks to Nakamura. He is really nice, approachable, full of smiles and made excellent alternative recommendations and reservations for restaurants. Check in/out at front desk was a breeze.

The view from the 36 floor was stunning. Internet was free and fast, though the limit to 3 devices, in Hilton, generally I believe, is a bit troublesome. 

The location is really great and again the always punctual bus service to Shinjuku station is great. It is also within a walking distance to a train station, which helped in the cold rainy weather. 

Just one warning for the Hilton Gold members. Book directly with the hotel and not with a 3rd party site. Or else privileges will not apply. We found out the hard way, and it was non-negotiable, to us at least.",4,2016/02/01
1,REDACTED,en,1193,"I love this hotel. I stayed May, 2014, and chose to return last week. It was a tough choice to burn all my Hilton points which I value so highly, but this 3 night stay was worth it. We had a lovely, spacious king bed junior suite which allowed an early bird and night owl to harmoniously exist.

I love having a Hilton credit card which gives automatic free wifi and breakfast for us both. In Tokyo, for two, that can be very expensive daily. I think the yummy breakfast buffet is about $40. The lobby is bright, although the music in the morning was a bit too loud for me (night owl) during breakfast. I liked the Japanese and western offerings and enjoyed experimenting. 

The credit card allowing gold status also allows access to the executive lounge if the hotel isn't at capacity (when I understand that they may limit to platinum), which provides such a divine respite from the hectic city. The lounge was perfect. We drank champagne, had a light dinner and even played backgammon on a quiet evening there.

We didn't get to try out the beautifully newly renovated bar and restaurant, opting for local meals out instead. (Go for late breakfast/early lunch at Tsukiji fish market! I rarely stand in a long line for a meal, but this was great.)

The staff is absolute perfection. From our arrival, Alberto and Ernesto (I hope I have Ernesto's name correct) at the front desk were lovely. We were tired after a long flight and ready to check in. Our room on the 22nd floor was soon ready. The king bed is extremely comfortable. I planned to take baths in the deep soaking tub, but stayed happy with the shower. The bathroom has a sliding Japanese style door to open to the suite for more light, but we preferred it closed. Housekeeping was great. The concierge spoke excellent English and was quite helpful.

Arriving from Narita on the Narita Express, you're dropped at Shinjuku station. Watch carefully for Bus stop 21 outside of Oedo department store. Both trips, I missed the sign and walked down long passageways killing an extra 45 minutes or so. I agree with other posters that its downfall is location. There's really nothing of interest within about 10 blocks. However, the Tocho-mae station is 2 blocks from the Holtin and far easier to deal with than the enormous nearby Shinjuku station (where I seem to always get frustratingly lost).

There is also an airport bus that goes directly from the hotel's front door to Haneda airport. 

Try for a higher floor facing the city rather than the side with some construction. Especially for those of you who are gold or platinum Hilton Honors members, I consider this hotel a fabulous value.",5,2016/01/31
1,REDACTED,en,1194,"I had a great experience at the Tokyo Hilton. The rooms are clean, modern and large by Japanese standards. The service was fantastic and the staff extremely helpful and friendly. I was upgraded to the executive floor and enjoyed a view of Mount Fuji from my room - wonderful! I had considered a different hotel closer to my offices, but in the end was so glad I had selected the Hilton. The proximity to the Shinjuku train station made getting anywhere in Tokyo very easy and quick. While there was a shuttle bus to the station, I chose to walk. It's really less than 15 minutes and a very pleasant area to walk around in. Overall, a great stay!",5,2016/01/31

1,REDACTED,en,1196,Was expecting them to provide super single beds but they only have single beds in that big room. But nevertheless it is clean and kept with the standards of what Hilton will provide us. They provide shuttle service to Keio Departmental Store which is quite convenient. But nearby the hotel it is only offices and nothing else.,5,2016/01/31
1,REDACTED,en,1197,"The junior suite we stayed in was nice, service from each and every one of the staff was impeccable.

The negatives -

1. the location is not really that convenient, it is in shinjuku but it is in a business district kind of area which is well away from the ""action"", you'll have to walk for some distance if you're planning on going around on the trains. The hotel has a free bus shuttle to shinjuku station, though, so it might work for those inclined to this kind of thing. 

2. The hilton is connected to the subway but it is quite a walk and we could not find elevators or escalators that you can use if you check out and want to get to the airport via the metro. Big negative if you have heavy luggage on your way out. Getting TO the hotel however is relatively easy but a bit tiring, head for exit A7 at tochomae station, then when you see a few stairs on your right go down (no escalator) and head straight ahead for exit C8. Signage isn't that clear, so ask the always helpful locals for directions if you feel lost. 

Will I stay here again? If on business yes. If on vacation, maybe not.",3,2016/01/31

1,REDACTED,en,1199,"We are a party of seven and booked into three seperate rooms. We booked rooms which included breakfast. 

Upon arriving we were ""super sized"" or up-sold to an executive suite and made Hilton club members. 
This is slightly better than a normal room and has the perks of access to the executive lounge and a special room away from the others at the 24hr buffet in the lobby. 

We were impressed with how well we were taken care of and the staff were extremely helpful. 

The executive lounge has different meal and snack periods throughout the day (incl. happy hour 6-8) and has a variety of vegetarian options and unlimited alcohol/drinks from the fridge. This was great when we came back from long day trips and wanted a quiet drink and snack before dinner. The area is kid friendly and has wifi access. 

Everything was going quite swimmingly until the second night when we decided to have dinner at the buffet downstairs (the same buffet where our included breakfast was served) because we were too tired to walk anywhere. 
We were seated in the special executive lounge area (where smoking is allowed - yes, smoking is allowed indoors in this spot so keep this in mind). 

For breakfast we had wandered out to the buffet freely, got our food and ate it where we were seated (exec. area) so when we came for dinner we assumed the same rules applied - apparently not! 

We went and got our food and wandered back in when we were abruptly stopped by a staff member and informed that we are not allowed to eat the food from the dinner buffet in the area where we were seated and that we were only allowed to order off the executive a la carte menu! (You can imagine what this was like - ludicrously overpriced and silly considering we had been drinking Chandon upstairs for no extra charge as executive suite guests).

She stood there waving her hands at us like we were lepers in front of other guests, motioning for us to leave. One of our party spoke up and said that was ridiculous, and the staff member got her supervisor who ushered us, with no apology whatsoever, out to the main dining area. 

Oh and to top it all off - a buffet dinner will cost you more than 70 AUD per head - so for our party to eat for one night is was nearly half a grand for a serve-yourself buffet, which is a joke. Where we are from, you can eat at the swankiest restaurant in town for less than that.

This event put such a downer on our night and we are disappointed that we were treated this way. Beware that, like most of these sort of places, they will extort as much money out of you as they can via. super sizing, bogus rules and up-selling.

The pro's of the place were: 
- wifi access
- good food quality, vege options 
- (for the most part) friendly staff
- good location
- seriously comfy mattresses",2,2016/01/29
1,REDACTED,en,1200,"Very good hotel, comfort room, the size of the room also so big. Love all the facilities. The staffs was very helpful. One of the challenge only not many staffs can speak English.

1,REDACTED,en,1201,"This was our 2nd time staying here (stayed 5 nights) plus we also stayed one single night just before we left Japan on our way to Kuala Lumpur. We arrived via taxi van after staying in Hilton Tokyo Bay and were so warmly greeted by Ms Hiroya-san that she made us feel like we were her own family !! The hotel had either remembered or documented that I like normal milk to make my coffee in our room with, so a silver jug of milk was already in the bar fridge upon arrival-excellent. We stayed in the interconnecting Executive suites like last time so felt right at home straight away with this also. There were 2 new staff that were very funny, friendly and helpful-Ken Shimano and Hero. The Hilton has just started opening up a 2nd Executive Lounge, presumably as main one becomes full and people are turned away. We were lucky enough to be able to go to the new lounge one evening and discovered it was mainly Australian guests in there so we all chatted and laughed together. 

The hotel is very conveniently located to the rail system or you can take advantage of the free shuttle bus to Shinjuku station like we did. It is also very convenient if you have an organised tour with Sunrise Tours as they pickup from the Hilton. We didn't look at the new restaurants on the 2nd level as we were more than happy with the buffet restaurant.

On New Years Eve, we saw an amusing site of 5 well dressed male Hilton staff pushing a very large grand piano along the path in front of the hotel and into the hotel for one of the News Years Eve events that the Hilton had organised. I did take a photo but unfortunately it is too blurry to attach here which is a shame as it was quite funny to watch and the staff were also laughing.

Even on New Years Eve when the staff must have been very busy, I noticed that they all still took the time to chat with guests when assisting them with enquiries or check ins and did not rush people. The staff also organised our Shinkansen (Bullet Train) tickets to and from Osaka well before our arrival which I greatly appreciated. Nothing is ever too much trouble for the Hilton staff-they do the kindest things that are unexpected but very appreciated.

Will be returning as soon as possible as simply our favourite hotel.",5,2016/01/27
1,REDACTED,en,1202,"It's a beautiful hotel unfortunately my boyfriend and I got there too early to check in but the hotel staff was kind enough to take our luggage and place it in our room when it was time to check in.

The location was great very short walk to the transit stations I suggest downloading any transit app to help you get around much better than a taxi! 

My boyfriend and I both felt the hotel was very business driven our room seem spacious but also like a big office with a bed the bathroom was ridiculously small and the lighting wasn't that great at the wardrobe area.

All in all great stay and a good view!",4,2016/01/27
1,REDACTED,en,1203,Absolutely fantastic hotel. Our rooms weren't huge but certainly big enough. The concierge staff was top notch - Marina secured us hard to get reservations and gave us cards in Japanese to give to our cab drivers so they'd know exactly where to go.

1,REDACTED,en,1204,"Our last trip to Tokyo was at the beginning of the Rainy Season end of June/beginning July 2015. We stayed 10 days (more or less 'camped down' at the Tokyo, Hilton in Shinjuku!) for family reasons. We chose this hotel, because we have had good experience with Hilton hotels worldwide, and they offer a favourable 'Senior Citizens rate'. We had a lovely spacious room overlooking Shinjuku-Central Park, with a fairly large bathroom. The hotel offered a free shuttle service to Shinjuku Railway Station, it is also within walking distance from the next Metro Station. However, if I had a question, I found that neither the Receptionists nor the Concierge understood/spoke very good English. Considering that most of the guests are international (including many Airline Crews) the spoken English of the front desk staff should be better. They did have a Spanish native speaker, which must have been a help to their Spanish speaking guests. Despite the fact that my husband is Japanese, I could not always summon him to ask the Front Desk something! Otherwise the Tokyo Hilton was excellent and very confortable!",4,2016/01/26

Staff are amazingly helpful and friendly. The eggs in the second floor breakfast out cooked to perfection. Only down side is not to great for finding restaurants for dinner in the area. It's an easy walk to the station. We recommend a Jr pass for getting around the city.",5,2016/01/26

1,REDACTED,en,1211,"I was happy with our choice of the Hilton. It's a nice (but very busy) hotel with the quality amenities expected from a Hilton. 

The location is good. Metro 5 mins walk and a hotel shuttle bus that runs every 20 mins to/from Shinjuku main station. Airport 'limousine' bus for Narita and Haneda stops at the hotel - perfect when you're tired after a long flight and aren't quite ready to navigate the Tokyo rail system. 

The room was very spacious by Japanese standards. 

The breakfast was excellent. Room service good. 

The only negative was the walls (and ceilings) were very thin - noise travelled through in an unusually clear way.",4,2016/01/19
1,REDACTED,en,1212,"This being my first trip to Tokyo (and Japan), I was unsure as to what neighbourhood to stay in. Eventually I settled on Shinjuku and chose the Hilton, primarily because I was able to use my points to stay there. It's not a bad hotel at all: the service is polite, if a little stiff, the various breakfasts (ground floor, 2nd floor, executive lounge) offer a good variety of Western & Japanese options, with everything being labelled in both English & Japanese. The location, a couple of minutes walk to either the ""M"" or ""E"" lines, plus the JR a little further up the road, makes for getting around Tokyo very easily. The hotel has an ATM in the lower level which worked perfectly with my foreign-issued ATM card (finding ATMs in Tokyo that work with foreign cards is very much a hit&miss affair). Connection to / from the airport is easily achieved with the Airport Limousine bus (Y3,000 for one way, or buy a r/t for about Y4,500). From the airport the hotel is the last stop, and took us two hours during rush hour traffic on a Friday. The bus stops right by the entrance to the lobby. For your return bus, make sure you reserve the bus in advance as it fills up quickly!

OK, that's the basics covered for the hotel. We didn't spend much time in the hotel as such, but I will say that the two primary room-related negatives is that the walls are quite thin. You really notice this when at 2am your neighbours are calling their homelands whose timezones places them in the middle of the day! The other annoyance is that the bathroom has a clear window'd wall into the room itself. You can pull a shutter to cover this up, but the shutter is essentially a paperscreen that allows bathroom light to stream through. That means that anyone turning on the light in the middle of the night will flood the room with light too. if you're a light sleeper this will definitely cause you to wake up!",4,2016/01/18
1,REDACTED,en,1213,"It is located very close to the subway, in fact it has underground access though we didn't use it until the end of our stay. It made getting around very easy. 

The room was excellent. Very modern and more space than we thought we would have in Tokyo. Lovely good sized bathroom with a large full size tub and separate shower though tub and shower are in one wet room area. Very comfortable bed. 

We sprang for an executive level room and very glad we did. The breakfast in the executive lounge had good variety and more than enough to start the morning. We went to the evening receptions and for the most part it was sufficient for dinner. We felt that the value we received from the executive lounge and staff more than made up for the difference in price. 

Eating in the hotel was good but quite expensive. We had drinks and appies with our tour guide both evenings after our full day tours as well as had lunch there our last day and it was pricey but probably not unusual for a major hotel in an expensive city. 

Like every place we visited in Japan the staff were gracious, helpful and wanting to do anything to make your stay wonderful. I discovered after checking out of the hotel that i had left something in our room. They went out of their way to locate it and was able to get it back.",4,2016/01/17

Alternatively, you can take the complimentary hotel shuttle bus which stops right outside the Shinjuku JR Station. Hotel has completed a full refurbishment to the guest rooms, meeting rooms and public areas. The Executive Room which I have stayed is very spacious and comfortable. The club lounge has a great view of Mount Fuji during good weather. Breakfast is of a good spread at the Marble Lounge all-day dining restaurant which opens 24 hours a day.

1,REDACTED,en,1219,"The location is good. It is effectively connected to the tube station and two of the main lines. And what a tube system! Incredibly cheap, spotlessly clean and so efficient. A credit to Japan - why can London not follow this?

The hotel could be better explained to its guests. The information is poorly presented and shoots itself in the foot. The breakfast is very good. There is a wide range of Japanese and western options. An egg station with two attentive cooks. Good bread/pastry selection and juice / coffee options.

It has a very large range of restaurants - both in the newly refurbished second floor and down below the ground floor. There is far too little information and signage about the options available. We tried the Chineese - which was good but to be frank over priced. I would not return as it simply was not value for money and failed to take it out of the category of captive hotel food.

The connection from the airport was very efficient, but at about 45 minutes, was longer than we were anticipating. The regular shuttle runs to Shinjuku main line station were very good.

The gym was good (there were 2 rooms - but again no signage and the smaller second room was only found by being told by their staff). My wife tried the pool and steam rooms. They were very quiet in the mornings which was good for us. I was disappointed there was no rowing machine and there should have been a few more cycling machines. The staff however were very friendly and helpful.

The room itself was fine - but by western standards small and limited. Insufficient space for storage. Poor choice of English speaking tv channels. We were on honeymoon. The hotel asked us to bring proof of marriage - which we did. Our reward.....which they promised on booking .....nothing - unless it was meant to be 3 thimble sized cakes in a plastic wrapper!!

The concierge service was friendly and efficient. It was our first visit to Japan and the trips arranged and directions provided were helpful.

We had a good time and would return. We just felt unusually for many hotels they didn't explain/sell themselves well. It felt a little chaotic/unstructured.",4,2016/01/14
1,REDACTED,en,1220,"My family and I had a very pleasant and comfortable stay at the Hilton for a week from Dec 27- Jan2. Transportation to and from the airport was easy but quite long. The first thing you will notice about this hotel is that the lobby is constantly full of people....always crowded. Although check-in queue took awhile, Front Desk staff were polite, efficient, and spoke English well. The staff at the Concierge are courteous, polite, and helpful, with an exception of one young female staff whose poker face expression seemed annoyed/unfriendly...

The room was good....comfortable. Bed was super comfortable...so much so, that my husband and I found ourselves sleeping longer and longer each night. Room and bathroom amenities were a little lacking compared to other similar level hotels I've stayed at. Even their international tv channels are very limited.

While the hotel is tucked away from the main shopping and eating areas of Shinjuku, there is a hotel shuttle every 15 minutes. It is also directly connected to the Marunouchi & Toei subway stations underneath. There is a 24-hour convenience store connected to the hotel to buy fruits, juices, breads, etc. 

I used the gym only once. While I had a good workout on the stationary bicycle, I think they need to renovate and update their machines and perhaps consider making it bigger--it's a tad small for me. There is a pool beside the gym long enough to do laps. The staff were nice and friendly.

Since we stayed during the New Year holiday, the hotel had several promotions going. Ironically, we spent it at another hotel in Riponggi for dinner & countdown. In hindsight, we should've celebrated at the Hilton, because by the time we came back to the hotel around 1am, the party was still going on. 

Overall, we were satisfied with our stay.",4,2016/01/13
1,REDACTED,en,1221,"We arrived at 5.30am, and with a small supplement were given a room. The junior suite meant our two kids slept on giant extra beds, super comfy unlike normal extra beds. There is a 15minute walk to Shinjuku station, a local playground and park, and lots of restaurants underneath the hotel as well as within 2 blocks.",5,2016/01/13
1,REDACTED,en,1222,"This is a mediocre hotel located near Shinjuku, a transport and shopping hub in Tokyo.  The service was extremely poor.  I would not recommend this hotel at all.      

It is a 10-15 minute walk or 10 minute free shuttle bus ride to Shinjuku station.  During peak hours, the shuttle bus can take up to 30 minutes.  Alternatively, it is a 5 minute walk to Shin-Shinjuku subway station, which is one station up from Shinjuku station on the (red) Marunouchi Line.  We found using Shin-Shinjuku station more convenient than waiting around for the shuttle bus.  

The Shinjuku area has a wide variety of shopping, restaurants and nightlife.  The area can be rough and hectic, and there is a prominent red light district nearby.  The Narita airport limousine bus stops at the hotel which makes airport transfers convenient.  

The room was clean, modern and spacious.  The bathroom was very small - with a shared bath and shower.  Only 1 person can comfortably fit in the bathroom at any given time.  Sleep quality was poor.  We were woken up every night by banging sounds from the room above us, the noise from the hallway and sirens from the hospital next door.  Cue tips and make-up cotton pads were not provided as amenities which frustrated my wife.  The gym was too small and poorly equipped for a hotel of this size and caliber.  It did not have any exercise bikes. 

We had a disappointing check-in experience.  We booked a non-smoking room.  However, the room had a strong cigarette smell and it was obvious the previous guest smoked in the room.  We returned to reception and requested a new room.  I thought this was a straightforward matter. 

The receptionist told us that another room was not available and that we could not change.  She would call housekeeping to spray the room.  The receptionist told us that the room we were given WAS non-smoking, despite the smell.  She also made the excuse that special amenities were already provided in the room as it was our honeymoon.  However, we did not notice anything special when we were there.  She was adamant that we could not change rooms.  

I complained that this was not up to Hilton standard and asked to speak to the duty manager.  The receptionist disappeared for 10 minutes.  Whether she actually called the manager or not, I do not know.   She eventually returned and gave us a new room - a room she previously said was unavailable.  The receptionist's behaviour was unprofessional, dishonest and revealed a poor attitude regarding customer service.  

One morning, I needed a document printed urgently.  All the computers at the business centre were occupied so I ran to reception to ask for help.  The receptionist told me that she could not help me and that I should talk to the concierge.  I ran to the concierge who also told me he could not help me.  After pressing the urgency of my situation - almost begging, he said he would help me print the document but I had to pay 100 yen per page.  I did not care about a few hundred yen and I do not think anyone capable of staying at the Hilton would, but that was what he was concerned with.   

I was extremely dissatisfied with the attitude of the Hilton staff, especially at a time I desperately needed their help.  What is a printed page and how much of a hassle is it really, during a quiet period in the morning?   It is a few simple clicks of a mouse but they were unwilling and/or reluctant to help me.

We dined at the hotel's Japanese restaurant one evening. I would not recommend the restaurant.  The sushi was overpriced and mediocre quality. 

Overall, the hotel was clean, comfortable, modern and in a good location - but that is all.  The service was poor and not up to Hilton standard.  The staff were cold, indifferent and unwilling to help.  On this basis, I definitely would not recommend Hilton Tokyo.  

The Shinjuku area, while convenient and lively, is not the most upmarket area.  Next time, I would stay in Ginza or Rappongi - and definitely with a different hotel chain.",2,2016/01/10
1,REDACTED,en,1223,The service at the Hilton Tokyo was excellent and the staff were well mannered. The room we stayed in could do with a renovation as it looked a little tired and the bathrooms are out-dated. Breakfast was well appointed and we had the option of multiple dining areas. The facilities available were very good.,4,2016/01/10
1,REDACTED,en,1224,"During booking I selected an option to upgrade to an executive room if available on checkin. While checking in I was told the upgrade is accepted and my wife and I would have an executive room for an extra approx 10,000 yen per night. However as we were doing the paperwork the two different people checking in on either side of me were also offered the same upgrade to an executive room but for free. I asked why it was free for them but around 10,000 yen a night for me and was told the difference was that I had selected the upgrade option when booking and they hadn't. So because I ticked a box on my booking I had to pay 10,000 yen/night while the two other groups got the same thing for free...

I therefore told the lady I didn't think I was really getting very good value for that and I would just stick with the original room I booked (I didn't want the upgrade). I was then told that was too late I couldn't have my original room because they had already made up the upgraded room for me. I was then asked to go to the lounge and wait because they were just waiting for people to leave my room so they could make it up. I then queried why it was too late to go back to my original booking then if the upgraded room wasn't actually made up as they had originally claimed. Finally after checking with the manager it was ok they agreed to let me have the original type of room I booked - and not have to pay an additional 10,000 yen/night for an upgrade I didn't want.

After the fun of checkin I thought id let off some frustration by playing a game of tennis. On trying to book the court I was told there is a court booking fee, a racket hiring fee, and the best part was a fee of 900 yen if I wanted to borrow a tennis ball (4). Really Hilton if you are advertising features like a tennis court as amenities on your website is it too much to ask to borrow a few tennis balls to play tennis! 

You pay a premium to stay in a 5 star hotel such as this, it's a shame that the service and the inclusions don't match the high price. For the cost there are better alternatives.",1,2016/01/09

1,REDACTED,en,1227,"Stayed in the hotel with my husband and friends in May 2015. Loved the hotel and love Tokyo! I normally don't like such large hotels but this one is the exception for sure. The rooms were great, restaurants excellent and of great variety, cleaning and staff very helpful and professional. We experienced a very large earthquake (7.8) while staying in the hotel and the level of professionalism by hotel staff in the situation was incredible. I would stay here again for sure and recommend it anyone and everyone.",5,2016/01/07
1,REDACTED,en,1228,"I don't typically go for giant hotels (500+ rooms) but the location and price of this was too good to turn down on my first time in Tokyo. It has over 800 rooms, a lot of restaurants, bars, shopping, spa, pool, fitness rooms, etc but they do a nice job of making sure that the crowds don't add up to long wait times. Service is friendly, helpful and efficient. The room was surprisingly spacious and since we were on the 33rd floor we had a pretty amazing view of Shinkjuku. You can walk to many attractions in the area, and it is centrally located to many transport hubs. I thought this was a good hotel for business travelers and travelers new to Tokyo.",4,2016/01/07
1,REDACTED,en,1229,"I stayed here in January 2016 with my husband and 2 kids aged 11 & 14. The hotel is reasonably well located...only 10 mins walk to the Shinjuku Station or a complimentary bus runs regularly to take you there. The room was fine. All four of us were in one room with the kids on rollaways which was fine for 2 nights. We were surprised and disappointed that movies on demand were not available. Other hotels in Tokyo that we had stayed at offered the ability to buy english movies which is helpful when the kids are tired after a long day. The restaurants looked good but were very expensive so we decided not to eat at them. We ate dinner nearby at a Japanese restaurant ""Hokkaido"" recommended by the concierge. We ate breakfast at the Hilton buffet which was around the expected price for a hotel buffet and fine. The indoor pool is small and was too crowded when the kids went to go for a swim. Wifi is included but restricted to 2 devices at a time which seems a bit outdated for an international hotel chain. The concierge and staff were helpful. Overall I would recommend this hotel.",4,2016/01/06
1,REDACTED,en,1230,"Let me start by saying how AMAZING Japan is! Everything from the people to the cuisine is phenomenal. Nowhere else (and we’ve traveled quite a bit) are people more hospitable, kind, organized and civilized. In fact, every country should strive to be more like Japan!

Unfortunately our stay at the Hilton wasn’t as great. We checked in on January 1st and the hotel lobby was a complete MAD house, granted it was January 1st but the crowds were ridiculous. Already a little hesitant due to the amount of traffic at the hotel, we moved on in the hopes our room would be worth the crowds, especially after being told we had been “upgraded” since we are Hilton Diamond members. Our so-called “upgrade” was simply getting a room on the executive floor, nothing more. The actual room (booked using Hilton honor points at a whopping 50,000 points a night) was EXTREMELY small…so small that my medium sized suitcase blocked the door when I laid it on the pre fabricated mounted wall suit case shelf (serious design flaw). The other suite case had to be tucked underneath the television because there was absolutely nowhere else to put it. The bathroom was outdated and the bathtub had several hairs in it, the AC wasn’t working very well and throughout the night we heard people coughing and walking across the hallway. The room did have a great view of Mount Fuji but I can’t get over how small the room was…

That same night, we headed to the executive lounge for some cocktails in an effort to cheer us up and again we were met by an absurd amount of people, the crowd was so large that folks were lining up outside of the lounge. Never have I ever witnessed such a crowd in an executive lounge. I would highly suggest the hotel invests in a larger lounge if non-Gold and Diamond members are authorized to use the lounge through certain room packages/deals.

The following morning, after a dreadful night, we contacted the front desk and after explaining everything they quickly upgraded us to a suite acknowledging that the so-called “upgrade” wasn’t really an upgrade that they had simply put us on the executive floor…the suite was gorgeous and we were very grateful for the upgrade!
Sadly my ordeal wasn’t over yet however, this time it involved the concierge desk. That evening, as a result of inaccurate directions, I spent 60 minutes (and $30 on a taxi) searching for a restaurant on a map printed out by the concierge folks that didn’t exist at the address provided. Several neighborhood residents were kind enough to walk me to the address listed on the map but each time we ended up at the same apartment building (no sign of a Japanese restaurant). Eventually I stopped searching for the restaurant, hopped on the metro and had a quick ramen meal. Ironically enough, while I received directions and a map from the concierge desk (before departing for the restaurant with a reservation), an older gentleman stormed into the hotel and demanded the concierge desk contact a manager ASAP. It seems that he had been provided (by the concierge desk) incorrect directions. Right before I stepped away from the desk, he stopped me and forewarned me about his ordeal, little did I know the same would happen to me! 

During my check out I was hoping someone would ask me how my stay was but no one did hence my review on trip advisor. As a diamond member, I would have expected a lot more.

The only reason this property is getting three stars is because of how amazing the Japanese people are and how pleasant it was to deal with them on a daily basis, though I must admit some folks at this Hilton are clearly “burnt out” from dealing with tourists (I don’t blame them). My overall advice is to book your stay somewhere else if you want a more personal and intimate experience. This property is a tourist black hole with a lot of traffic. As a diamond member I would have expected a lot more…Hilton, you can do better than this!",3,2016/01/06

1,REDACTED,en,1233,"We stayed at Hilton for 2 nights. Our flight landed in Tokyo early so we tried to check in early and the staff tried to upsell the executive room to us. He wasnt pushy with the sale but it felt impersonal.
Although it is 5 star hotel and the staff are competant and polite, the hotel made us feel like just another number. There was no personalised service and the experience left us feeling a bit flat and cold. 
The room was tastefully decorated and had a nice view of the city, but there was no soundproofing. You could hear the kids runnings in the hallways and talking in other rooms. This contributed to a great lack of sleep. 
The hotel kindly organised xmas card, chocolates and wine, the gifts seemed to be generic and without care. The card was also printed out poorly with lines across the sentences showing the printer was running out of ink. Again this reinforces that there was no personalised touch which is something that is expected when staying in a 5 star hotel. 
In the end, we didnt feel valued and will not be returning.",3,2016/01/05
1,REDACTED,en,1234,"The hotel is very nice, with polite and friendly staff as any other Hiltons. The executive lounge at 37th floor is in the average level in terms of food, I mean, I know better Hilton lounges. But the lounge offers a good view over the streets and surrounding buildings. The breakfast on the ground floor offers a larger choice of beverages and food than in the lounge, but if you go late, there will be a lot of people. There is a shuttle bus service every 20 minutes to and from Shinjuku station, which is one of the biggest stations in Tokyo. So, you will find department stores. There are also multi-media stores like Biccamera and Yodobashi camera, where you can buy digital cameras, computers, as well as all kinds of peripheral equipment. The only issue is that there are a very limited number of seats in the lobby. So, for instance, if you decide to take a Limousin bus to go to an airport, you will probably have to wait standing. A part from that, it is a nice hotel.",4,2016/01/05

Their shuttle is very regular and runs till late. The check in was smooth and no hassles at all. The lobby does get very crowded and not much space for all the tourists they get. the rooms are big for Toyko standards, and beds are very comfortable. The hotel does have the 5-star feel to it, and lives up to the Hilton brand name. There are not much food options around the hotel, so best to take the shuttle to Shinjuku for food. It is also within walking distance there, about 15 minutes walk. There is a basement walkway to a Metro station which is also very convenient. The walk to that is about 5 minutes.

Even the excelence of japanese services can't resist the massive numbers Tokyo Hilton have hosted this last week . For instance, I had to request by phone on occasions additional toilletries . It either took the hotel too long to respond or it did not respond at all . One other time phone communication services was just unavailable . Also , this Hotel needs a lift-up in most areas. Lobby look small and has a strange staircase that occupies too much space for no clear purpose.

The concierge was excellent, the staff spoke very good English, and were keen to help. The staff immediately stepped forward from behind the counter to attend to me, while her other colleagues were attending to other guests at the concierge. 

The restaurant serving breakfast was a very busy one. Expect to have crowds in the morning. Despite that, there was no shortfall in service. I was attended to very quickly and was ushered to my table, nicely prepared and layed out. The service was swift and efficient.

Hilton is a good brand in my mindset and this is my first time to travel in Tokyo thus I chose Hilton Tokyo as it is very handy to Shinjuku. Hotel offers free shuttle bus from property to Shinjuku train station from the early morning till about 9:40pm. I think if it can extend to mid night that would be much better because taxi is the only transportation at the night time but expensive especially when you have done a long walk at outside. Breakfast is not bad but no surprise. Personally I love the ""Fresh Green Juice"" very much. Service I would rate as mid-high grade, not too warm but definitely is star grade hotel service.

Three months before I'd arrived I realised the agent had booked one double and two twin rooms. I wanted three double rooms. I emailed the hotel and the agent. Hilton refused to amend the booking until the agent sent a revised confirmation. This didn't materialise so I asked the hotel to do it themselves. The double rooms were actually cheaper and there were plenty available. 

They refused to help even thought I'd prepaid for the rooms. Months of emailing later they then said they couldn't change the rooms because they were fully booked. Two days before we arrived they emailed to ask if I wanted to spend over a thousand dollars a night upgrading my rooms or whether I would like to downgrade my rooms without a refund. 

When we checked in we were kept waiting for over half an hour while someone tried to help us. When we asked for a late checkout they refused. 

The hotel is so busy over this period that they simply don't need your business and don't need to help you. I won't stay in a Hilton again. 

Aside from that the hotel looks modern and is well finished. The bar and restaurants are good but the service within them varies depending on the attitude of the person serving you. 

The hotel is two hours from Narita but once at the hotel it is well situated to explore the city.

1,REDACTED,en,1252,"Hi, we booked many months ago for a 4 night stay at the Tokyo Hilton in December to finish off our Japan tour. There are 4 in our family and I approached the hotel by email before the booking enquiring whether it was ok to book the King Jr. Suite as a HHonours gold member using the spouse stays free option. I received a prompt reply from the hotel saying no problem at all, the room can accommodate 4 of you. On arrival for our stay the lady at check in was quite adamant you can't have 4 in the room but was not providing any other options. There was a bit of a Mexican stand off for a while and I couldn't access my email to show her. Anyway, after she made some calls she upgraded us to a King Jr. Executive suite on the 27th floor and 2 roll away beds were brought in as planned in the first place. After we finally checked in the head of guest relations, Albert, came and introduced himself personally and apologised for the inconvenience. Apart from the shaky start the rest of our stay was faultless. It is a great hotel. Fantastic staff everywhere. Beautiful rooms. Breakfast was great. The first 2 mornings we ate in the lobby which is quite busy. The next 2 as HHonours members we were entitled to have breakfast on the second floor. Basically it was the same offering but almost private. One morning we were the only people in there. So if your eligible and want a quiet morning definitely go here. We also had access to the executive lounge which is a nice retreat at the end of a day of sightseeing. It can get busy but we never couldn't get a seat for 4 of us. Beautiful selection of hot and cold snacks (mini meals) and a complete open bar to self serve from. One night we were tired and it even doubled as dinner as no one wanted to go out after relaxing for an hour there. Concierge gave us good recommendations for dinner, we got subway passes off them, booked and caught our airport limousine to Narita and other general help as required. We didn't use any of the fitness areas. Tokyo is a bit overwhelming for a first time visitor because of its size but the Shinjuku location is great. On reflection if I went back to Tokyo I see no reason not to stay in this location again. Public transport is so good it's not really too far to anywhere. Tokyo Hilton was a great choice!",5,2015/12/26

1,REDACTED,en,1254,"We stayed in Hilton Tokyo two times in December during our honeymoon trip to Japan. Had our infant with us and I have to say wow. 

First we had room on the top floor king suite facing the city, truly amazing. Bed was huge and great with pillows to choose from, nice decor and really clean. Executive lounge was great with quick check in and check out, snacks and drinks, nice relaxed atmosphere and great view. We even had change to see Mt.Fuji on a clear morning. 

Second time we stayed at a jr. suite on 26th floor, also city view and I liked the room decor even more than in king suite. 

You can get Airport limousine straight to the hotel from both Narita and Haneda airport. They have their own free shuttle bus to Shinjuku station but I rather walked since it was just 15min walk anyway. You can have straight access to Marunouchi line under neat the streets, just about 7min walk and not that big metro station. There is a 24h convenient store downstairs, lot of restaurants in hotel and buildings basement floors around the Hilton Tokyo hotel. Also Shinjuku is full of restaurant. Overall a perfect place to stay, being in the middle of everything the area still is pretty quiet and has even a park right next to it. Pretty sure we will be staying here again :). 

Thank you Hilton Tokyo, it was truly a pleasure.",5,2015/12/25

1,REDACTED,en,1256,"On my third trip to Tokyo I decided to stay in Shinjuku for a few days of the trip (I usually stay in Roppongi). Being a Hilton Honors member the obvious choice was the Hilton Tokyo. 
Accessing the Hilton from Narita was very simple and efficient. Just catch the Narita Express from the airport and take it to Shinjuku Station. Its about 55mins and the map display and announcements keep riders well informed of their current location and upcoming destination.
Once you reach Shinjuku Station, just follow the signs throughout the station that advise of the direction to the Hilton. Once outside, its about a half-mile walk or you could catch the Hilton Shuttle to the Hotel.

From the time you arrive at the Hilton the staff is warm, friendly, and very attentive. They are also very well dressed and exhibit very respectful manners. Albert is the Guest Relations Manager and has done a fantastic job training the staff.

Once you get settled, be sure to check out one of the excellent dining options on the second floor. Various fine dining options include a steakhouse, japanese, and chinese. If you opt for the Chinese do not miss the Gyoza appetizers. Yes, I know Gyoza are fairly common throughout any part of the world, but these are made from the Japanese Black Pig. Regarded as the highest quality pork in the world, these are hands down the best Gyoza I have ever had. The food and beverage director, Diego, will be pacing about ensuring that guests enjoy a second to none dining experience. 

If you feel like exploring, the Hilton is surrounded by many Tokyo landmarks. The Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, Shinjuku Park, Shinjuku Shopping District (where Blade Runner was filmed for you Sci-Fi nerds) and the Robot Restaraunt are all a within a short walk.

Aside from the great customer service, every aspect of the hotel is great as well - room, lobby, location, shuttle to the train station, 24 hour convenience store.

Most of the things were nice except for the internet/wifi facility. Can't believe a 5 stars hotel like this does not provide wifi for free - one needs to go to the lobby to get the free access. Prefer to give access for visitors rather than sleep in guests? Not sure why...I visited Japan many times & most hotels including those with fewer stars provided free & fast wifi.

1,REDACTED,en,1262,"First time in Tokyo, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Hilton.

The hotel is conveniently located - about 10 mins walk to the Shinjyuku Station, and the infamous eating & drinking district. There is also a subway station very close by (less than 5 mins walk), making it a perfect base for exploring the city.

We were upgraded to the executive king room. The room was recently decorated and had a nice contemporary feel to it. The bed was very comfortable, and the shower / bath was great. The toiletries from Peter Thomas Roth were also fantastic.

The gym and the swimming pool was a bit small for such a large hotel, but it did not feel crowded when we were there. The changing facilities and bath felt slightly dated, but was clean and very well maintained.

Service was impeccable. The concierge was extremely helpful throughout our stay. They recommended a number of good restaurants to us, and also helped us communicating with our Ryokan in Kyoto as they do not speak any English. 

Overall we had a fantastic stay. We were originally a bit weary because of the size of the hotel, but the staff made us feel welcomed, and the service was very personal.

PS Beware not all rooms (even the deluxe rooms) have been renovated, so make sure you double check with the receptionist when checking in! There is a huge difference between the renovated and un-renovated rooms.",5,2015/12/19

I needed reservations at some of the hardest to get places, no problem. Super professional. Super timely response. B/C it was a Hilton, they tried to get you to upgrade at the last minute to a different room or a suite, which is kind of annoying. 

The (french) guy tried to persuade the lady in front of me for a good 3-5 minutes that her room was inadequate and she would ""much prefer"" the bigger room. Don't think tha'ts the type of service I want from this hotel in Tokyo.

It's a little farther from the action/subway than Keio Plaza.

I shared a two-bed junior suite with a friend, with executive privileges. This got us access to the executive lounge on the 37th floor, along with a complimentary breakfast. 

The lounge was great! Killer views. Self-serve bar, and a well-stocked buffet of small bites. Couldn't have been better.

The breakfast buffet in the lobby restaurant was pretty much perfect. Attentive service, tons of choices.

I played tennis twice with the on-site pro Paulis, and he couldn't have been nicer or more qualified.

The gym, pool, sauna, spa, etc. was perfect.

The shuttle bus to and from the Shinjuku station worked great.

Within an easy walk to Shinjuku, the Hilton has the added convenience of a passage link to the quieter Nishi Shinjuku metro station.

We only dined once in the hotel, in the lobby lounge on our first night, but that was a tad pricey for what we got. One small bowl of soup, a small charcuterie plate and 2 beers.... $80.00!
We had breakfast each day at Denny's (yes, Denny's!) only half a block away and great value. You have a choice of Western or Japanese items and the breakfast set only ¥800! worth the walk.

The wireless internet speed was ""ok"", even with the ""premium"" service, and limited to three devices. The service in the Executive Lounge was excellent, and had a good breakfast spread. The selection at the breakfast downstairs in the restaurant was excellent. Starbucks within 2 blocks, and several fine noodle restaurants just in the next building.

The executive lounge though worth the upgrade, does get very busy and crowded in the evenings.The breakfast spread was fabulous. Dine in options are expensive, but then Tokyo is an expensive city.

It is a 5-10 min walk to the Shinjuku station, so it is close to lots of shops and restaurants. The rooms are very clean and are very, very quiet. I never heard any noise from the hallway or adjacent rooms. Lastly, this may sound funny, it is the best smelling hotel I've ever stayed at too.

Had a map to get to the hotel which was easy to follow, it was raining, but we managed the 20 minute walk most of the way underground. Feeling tired on arrival, the amazing staff took over and we were taken to one of the largest Hilton Hotel rooms I have stayed in with a very large separate lounge. Its a shame that there was so much to do in Tokyo as we could have spent two days in the hotel chilling out and relaxing.

There is a small bus which goes to Shinjuko station regularly, saving the 20 min walk, especially in bad weather, it is more of a life saver when you have been out all day and don't want to do any more walking. 

The breakfast as always was amazing as it is at all Hilton Hotels! We decided to eat in the restaurant on our final night at the buffet by the large Christmas tree as it was the last night of our trip before returning to the UK and it was just a perfect and memorable end to the trip.

Highly recommended hotel if you like a few western comforts at the end of your trip, much larger rooms than other hotels we stayed at in Japan but obviously pricier.",5,2015/12/02

A small concierge error (miscommunication, perhaps?) with an off-campus restaurant was forgiven when lovely chocolates were unexpectedly sent to my room with a handwritten note. Free shuttle to Shinjiku station. Although this is a large hotel, it sells out, so book early. Very accommodating to Westerners.
I booked different rooms during my stay, and the executive level views with access to the club were great. Regular rooms were also stylish and comfortable. Several restaurants to choose from on campus, food well executed. Small gym with onsen-style bathing facilities. Like everywhere in Japan, the staff were efficient and friendly. If you're taking the Narita Express train to Narita airport from the hotel, I recommend a taxi to the ""Southern Terrace Entrance"" of Shinjiku station (it's the closest to your platform, otherwise you could be wandering around the huge station).",4,2015/11/29

1,REDACTED,en,1290,"It was our first visit to Japan and, as independent travellers, we wished to stay in a western style hotel for the first part of our visit (8 days before moving on). This hotel suited us perfectly.
We transferred from Narita airport directly to the hotel using the Limousine bus service (Google them) which cost us roughly £16 each one way and takes about 90 mins. 
The hotel is in the Shinjuku area and has it's own metro stop beneath the hotel at Nishi shinjuku.
My first impressions were that it was large, busy, clean, friendly, corporate, well staffed, efficient and impressively glam. Check in was straight forward and hassle free. The hotel staff on reception all had excellent English (or rather American) and all the staff that we encountered were, without exception, happy to help, polite, cheerful, friendly and efficient. We were never ignored and always greeted with a welcoming smile. Our room, a junior executive suite, on the 16th floor, was spacious, clean, quiet, tasteful and well equipped, with all you would expect. The shower in the bathroom was great. The executive lounge facility on the 37th floor (from which you can see Mt Fuji on a clear day), which comes as an optional, additional charge is well worth considering. It turned out to be excellent value for money. There are 3 restaurants at the hotel but we dined only in one, Junisoh, as Tokyo has so many to choose from. The hotel also has a shuttle bus that operates to the Shinjuku railway station. I cannot fault our stay here and in fact when the time came I really didn't want to leave.",5,2015/11/24

I speak no Japanese at all, but this was never a problem.
My room was very nice with a very functional desk, many modern touches and a view of the city over towards Shinjuku Station (only a 10- 15 minute walk away). If you aren't taking the train, there are also a couple metro stations which are even closer. Which station you prefer will all depend on the direction you are heading. The WIFI signal in the hotel was strong and allowed for me to easily do office work from my room when I needed to do so. Breakfast was delicious with a mixture of western and Japanese favourites.

1,REDACTED,en,1295,"I was a bit sceptical about booking here, after reading one or two negative reviews - with some serious issues discussed. I decide to contact the hotel's GM, who personally replied to my email explaining the reasons for the negative feedback and stating the hotel's viewpoint etc. etc. Consequently, we went ahead and booked 2 rooms for my family (4 people incl. 2 HH Diamond) and were immediately given guaranteed upgrades, one room being a suite ! We were treated like royalty from the moment we checked in until the moment we left the hotel. Both rooms were spacious and had lots of goodies in them - fruit juice, water, snacks etc., all on the house - and the minimalistic décor was perfect. Sleep quality was 100% in the wonderfully comfortable beds. It is a BIG hotel and the Executive Lounge could get very busy at breakfast time and even more so in the evenings. The hotel's management deals with this ""probelm"" by opening a second, more exclusive, lounge in the evenings. The second lounge is normally limited to Diamond members. I have read some negative f/b re. this overflow lounge but, personally, I found it MUCH more preferable to the main lounge as it has a very private feel, is much less busy and noisy, and an altogether calmer ambience, not unlike some of the better First Class lounges at some airports. The food & beverage choice is identical in both lounges. I cannot praise the staff enough : when we checked in (in the Exe Lounge) it was smiles and bowing all round, very friendly and, of course, efficient. Check-out was the same - we were treated like a cross between Royalty and life-long friends - and when we exited the lift on the ground floor, there was a reception committee waiting for us with parting gifts and hotel teddy bears and asking us to come back soon. If every Hilton was this good, I would never need to look to other brands. A wonderful stay, A wonderful experience. There's no doubt that we would definitely make a beeline for this hotel on any and all future visits to Tokyo. Exceptional staff. Exceptional service. Exceptional quality.

1,REDACTED,en,1298,"I stayed here for business (and quite a bit of sightseeing) over nearly 8 months, and it was a great experience. First off, this hotel is in a properly good location with Shinjuku, one of the more happening neighborhoods of Tokyo, being within walking distance from the hotel. In addition the Nishi-shinjuku metro station is just below the hotel (underground) on the Marounouchi line, which really helps if you want to go budget sightseeing or by direct subway to Tokyo station for Shinkansen. The hotel is connected to both Narita and Haneda airports by ""Airport Limousine bus"" (check the counter just outside customs at both airports"". There is also a shuttle bus every 20 mins from Shinjuku station, which takes about 15 mins to reach the hotel.

The room sizes are quite consistent with international hotels, as compared to typical Japanese rooms which are small. As I was a Hhonors Diamond member I was always upgraded to the ""Executive Rooms"" which were slightly larger than the typical rooms. However whenever there were vacant suites, I would be upgraded when I asked at the check in desk. Room service was not that great as the restaurants were under renovation, but the food options are the restaurants and breakfast buffet were quite large. The concierge was very helpful in terms of planning weekend itineraries, logistics, arranging for station pick ups and drops, etc. Being in a central location with multiple stores, restaurants and bars nearby, I always felt it was a very happening place.

We arrived earlier than the suggested check-in time and the staff at the counter were more than happy to allow us for early check in - which was great after a long night out the night before. I have to say our whole experience at this hotel was great, from the buffet breakfasts and brunches to the facilities such as the fitness center, everything we needed was provided. The Hilton Tokyo also provided a shuttle bus to Shinjuku station at about a 20 minute frequency which was excellent and made our trip extremely convenient.

The room is very clean and good size. The staff is very friendly and helpful. 

There are quite a few restaurants inside the hotel. They are not cheap but the quality is very good. My friend and I had tried the second floor sushi restaurant and lobby one. The breakfast buffet is very good with a huge selections of choices for everyone. 

This hotel is a big one and therefore, there are always a lot of people in the lobby. Feels quite crowded and there are not many chairs for people to sit. 

One thing that I was very impressed is that the staff at the concierge desk is very helpful! BTW, you can buy Tokyo Subway three day pass at the concierge desk.

One last thing, there are a few shops in the basement including a coffee shop, which is not bad.",4,2015/11/17
1,REDACTED,en,1302,"I really enjoyed my stay. The room was large by Japanese standards, with a splendid view to the South, from which I was able to see Mount Fuji as the sun rose in the morning. I enjoyed going jogging in the nearby Central Park and down to Meiji Jingu gardens.",5,2015/11/17
1,REDACTED,en,1303,"The hotel is located in the busy Shinjuku area and is well connected by Metro. One can easily walk to the metro station (nishishinjuku) from the lobby of the hotel, without ever having to see daylight. 

The rooms are a tad small when compared to similar hotels worldwide, but I guess the fact that this hotel is located in Tokyo makes it OK. However, there is nothing lacking in the rooms and everything is well provided for. 

The hotel offers a large breakfast spread and a well appointed lounge that serves drinks + snacks almost throughout the day. The lounge does have different meals for breakfast/afternoon tea/evening etc... but it serves its purpose to catch a quick snack when you are hungry. (Lounge entry is complimentary for Hhonors Gold and above) 

The hotel also have a 24/7 convenience store at the basement which is extremely helpful for a quick midnight snack (and you do not want to order room service). There is also an ATM just beside this store.

The staff was remarkably polite and extremely helpful (just like most Japanese we met). Though a lot do not speak English, they will do their 110% to understand you or bring someone who speaks English and help you in any way possible. 

Loved the Yakutas in the hotel which served as robes, but were so comfy to just laze around in :) !",5,2015/11/15

1,REDACTED,en,1305,"It was a family trip to Tokyo. We stayed in Hilton Tokyo for the first time. I must say that it was a great experience in all respects. Breakfast was a festival of the Japanese and European food of premium quality. Sushi restaurant offered a choice of different sashimi menu, we chose two of them. The sushi master, Jun Saitoh, was preparing food in front of us. Sahimi was delicious and worth its price. I would also recommend trying some cakes made by a British maitre chocolatier. Special thanks to Atsushi Taniguchi who let us stay in the room until 3 p.m. (we got caught in Guam by taifun and we practically lost our reservation in Hilton Tokyo, we came to the hotel at 11.00 ) also special thanks to Tomoko Aoki who helped me send a parcel (the nearest post office didn’t accept parcels!!!).

1,REDACTED,en,1306,"I've stayed at the Hilton Shinjuku on business a few times and liked it so much I came back with my wife and stayed on my own dime. 
We checked in to a fully renovated room on a Club floor which has Japanese influenced decor. The rooms are small but extremely comfortable. The front of the hotel has great views over the greenery and brightly lit offices in the Government/Business district. 
The breakfast in the lobby cafe is excellent while the drinks and canapes at the executive lounge in the evening were the highlight of our day. 
The hotel is directly connected by an underground walkway to Nishi-Shinjuku metro station and a short walk to Kabuki-Cho and major shops. The main Shinjuku station with its connections to Narita is close by too.
If you do not like paying hotel prices for food, there are lots of good restaurants hidden away under the local office buildings - a little bit of exploring will pay off here.
From my point-of-view the Hilton Shinjuku is superb - 10/10.",5,2015/11/12

It is spotless; excellent location for walking and shopping; within two blocks of the ""subway"" if you choose to use it (we did and found it to be fun, spotless, on time and easy. We are seniors and can afford any means of travel, but like to take local transportation on occasion). We were offered an included breakfast. It is a buffet with more offerings than you need. Finally, the Concierge Desk is one of the best that we have encountered. They were always helpful; knowledgeable; and delightful in spirit. In fact, all of the Hilton employees were friendly and smiling. We used this location as our base until we had to go to Yokohama to pick up our cruise.",5,2015/11/11

We had three rooms with 9 people and we all loved this hotel. It felt upscale and clean. Rooms were decent with very comfortable beds. 

Best part of our stay here was the buffet! Holy hannah - there was everything from sautéed green beans to porridge to bacon to lychees on the expansive buffet. We ate like kings every morning. My daughter adores asian foods and there was a lot for her to choose from, from congee to rice to natto, and more. We found ourselves hanging out over breakfast, enjoying smoothies and cappuccinos. Very nice. We didn't eat dinner here. There is a shopping plaza nearby with other choices that we found convenient. 

Rooms were pricey but worth it, and large enough for 4 people which is rare, apparently, in Tokyo. Across the street was a nice little walking park with a Shinto shrine in one part, and walking and running markers in a winding park setting. Really nice to walk and talk, or get a run in. There was also a Starbucks across the street, and a Denny's and MacDonald's nearby.

We enjoyed the indoor swimming pool and had no issues with being fairly heavily tattooed folk (I have a full back tattoo very visible in a bathing suit, and my partner has 3/4 sleeves and a shoulder tattoo).

The location of this hotel is very convenient and located in the quiet business district. This is a very busy hotel especially the lobby and all staff are warm and welcoming, and provide you service as soon as you ask for it. The buffet breakfast area is busy and provides a very relaxing atmosphere. 

Do not hesitate to stay at this hotel as it really makes you feel at home, you will enjoy it. Although people post comments on the size of the gym I'm not sure that they are aware that there are two sections - weights/cardio, & cardio sections. Will definitely stay here again.",5,2015/11/08

aside from the high price, the downside is it's far from the tochomae and nishinjuku stations, which has direct links to attractions. i guess this makes it more of a business hotel rather than a hotel for tourists. they also do not offer free wifi in the rooms, only in the lobby (so it can get pretty crowded with all of the people checking in and out and the people surfing the net).",4,2015/11/08
1,REDACTED,en,1315,"After spending 5 weeks in South East Asia we booked the Hilton in Tokyo to end the trip with a bang...what an absoloute waste of hard earnt money. Disgraceful effort Hilton.

5 nights cost us an excess of $2000 and with that apparently Hilton cannot provide complimentary water. Every single hotel thus far, inluding what we thought were the worst, always provided free bottles of water and a decent selction of tea.
The Hilton specifically made a point to mention that their water was NOT complimentary...I felt like an digraded slave when I read this. 
Whomever authorised those words to be written on the water should be fired.

The room is clean and the bathroom is equipped with what a bathroom needs but I can't say this hotel is worth the dime in any way shape or form. 

In room dining charges $10 for a coke and if you think that's crazy then don't even think about dining at the buffet (p.s it costs $94 pp for dinner)

Hilton Tokyo needs to lift their game if they expect to charge so much for what I would class as a very average experience. Disgraceful effort Hilton.

We arrived straight off a long flight, first thing in the morning, but they allowed us to check in early as soon as the room was available (around 10:30-11:00 am) and upgraded us (courtesy of HHONORS membership). The hotel is well located for Shinjuku, only 10 mins walk from Shinjuku station (we only had to use the shuttle once, when we left with luggage, otherwise it is easier to walk). We got the airport limousine bus from Haneda airport, it is much easier if you have luggage and good value at around YEN 1200. The hotel is well equipped, the staff very helpful and the rooms much bigger than we had expected in Tokyo (much bigger than the hotel we moved to in Shinagawa). Would recommend it without hesitation.",5,2015/11/07
1,REDACTED,en,1317,"Yes, you reach it easily by the airport bus, as this one stops right in front and if you take a taxi to haneda, this is only 45min and costs you around 8000yen. The entrace hall though has come of age and having breakfast there feels like being in a station. If you can choose a room that allows you to enter the executive floor on the 37th floor, you have great views, large selection and some peace for your start of the day.
The gym is very small for sucha big hotel and we squeezed into the place in the morning. Nobody was swimming, but no surprise, the pool is around 10 m only.

Their service was excellent, special thanks to Monica at the front desk who patiently helped me arrange all the rooms for our group of 15 for the initial arrival and the succeeding one. She made all of our stays that much more enjoyable by helping us get the right rooms that would accommodate our group.
The location was very convenient as it was walking distance from 2 subway stops and the JR Line. In addition, the hotel provided shuttle service to the JR station if you were too tired to walk.

The Room was excellent, staff were very helpful and the Hotel is close to Shinjuku station and a great base to explore more of Tokyo. There is a lovely park across the road for a stroll or some meditation away from the city hustle and bustle. The Hotel also connects to ""Hiltopia"" which is a small underground mall which also has a Convenience Store which was very handy.",5,2015/11/02
1,REDACTED,en,1325,"Brilliant hotel, excellent location and even better staff!

After a 24 hour journey into to Tokyo from London, I was glad to find that the airport had a 'Limousine' (minibus) service into Shinjuku and that the Hilton Tokyo was one of the few stops that it made. (Cost was 3,100Y/£17 per person) which saved time and effort of taking the train system. Cabs from the airport are too expensive.

When at the hotel, the service levels were superb, from the helpful front of hotel staff with our bags and even more so once at the main reception. We had the pleasure of being checked in by Ernesto, who was very courteous and interesting to speak with. As we were checking in for a special occasion, Ernesto informed us that he had upgraded us from a standard double room to a City View suite. This was very much appreciated, and once we got to the room, we really got to grips with how very generous the upgrade was. 

The room was brilliant - modern, contemporary but with nuances of Japanese tradition. The room had a seperate lounge area, a seperate bedroom and a very generously sized walk in shower. We made use of the executive lounge for a day (to experience it) and this was also exceptional. The canapes were tasty and the drinks selection was varied. We also had breakfast at the St George's Bar, the choice of food was vast and the quality was very high.

The hotel offers a shuttle bus to Shinjuku main station which is very helpful, and it runs every 20 minutes. Alternatively, the hotel also has an undergound passage to two subway stations which run two different lines depending on where you want to go. Although daunting at first, the subway is the ONLY way to travel around Tokyo in my opinion. It makes things easier, cheaper and quicker. You can purchase travel passes from Concierge, I purchased a 3 day travel card which is 1,500Y (£8) which is a bargain for the amount me and my wife used the underground.

The hotel is situated in an ideal position for seeing all of Tokyo, but also has some local based points of interest such as the Government building. it is also build above an underground shopping area which is ideal and means you don't need to leave the hotel for things like convenience goods.

The indoor pool and gym facilities are very good and empty if you use them later in the evening. The pool is fairly sized and everything is kept emaculately clean!

I could go on all day about my experience at this hotel, but in short, WHEN I go back to Tokyo (because it is a city that is deserving of around 2 weeks and not just the 4 I gave it) - I will not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2015/11/02

Air conditioning is controlable at all times of air, whatever the temperature outside. The executive lounge on the 37th floor is even better now with fresh orange juice in the mornings. Good selection of alcoholic beverages in the evenings, but wish they served non alcoholic beer also. The lounge can get really busy and now there is sometimes an overflow lounge too, so this hotel has listened to some of the past complaints. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015/11/01

Airport Limousine Bus Transportation is available to and from Narita Airport which delivers you right to the hotel for a reasonable charge and on a convenient schedule. The hotel breakfast is very good but the menu could use some small changes on a daily basis to add some variety if your staying for extended periods of time. This is a great place to stay in Tokyo, rooms are clean and large, the bathroom is small and could have been arranged for more convenience but serves the purpose.

Initially, we were annoyed that we had booked a hotel so far out of the centre but it proved not to be a problem. Shinjuku has some good restaurants and is a nice walk from Yoyogi Park and the fun area with the Shiboya crossing. It is also an easy 4 stop train journey to Tokyo's central station where you catch the Bullet Train.
The hotel itself is great. Clean, modern, helpful; everything you want. We decided not to pay for breakfast as we didn't want a big buffet but walked to Starbucks round the corner each morning. We did have the buffet in the evening on our first night. We had missed a nights sleep and were at the end of our tether so probably not in the best condition to judge it but it seemed about a 6 out of 10.

The 2nd floor restaurants, as well as the 24hr main floor restaurant are excellent but, believe me, you pay for it. The location is near Shinjuku station with frequent free shuttle bus service to and from the hotel, so transportation is not an issue. All points in the city and beyond are easily reachable by public transport. A Pasmo pass and JR Rail pass will greatly simplify your travel and save you a load of headaches.

However upon arriving at 12am, the front desk staff did not say anything about not having the correct room available. They simply gave us our key. Upon arriving to the room, it was a queen size bed and when I called them, they apologized but said they would upgrade us 2 nights later.

2 nights out of 4 nights is half of my stay.....when I complained to them, they just said they will give us an upgrade for a future stay. Not like I will stay there again based on this experience.

The restaurants have recently been revamped. I am not a fan of the new style 2nd floor high tech like area and find the 1st floor restaurant too expensive (e.g. breakfast is full course, walk through, on site omelet maker, etc. for about $26). If going to the Shinjuku train station, pick any place over there for a better value.

Our stay came with a $40 breakfast buffet each morning which offered a plethora of options from Japanese food to American, a juice, omelette, coffee and cereal bar, and more.

Rooms were nice; it was my first time experiencing a Japanese toilet, which, by the end of my trip, I wanted to buy. The rooms are fully stocked with hygiene supplies and tea, and cleaned daily if you wanted.

Lastly, I must rave about the concierge service, which called at least 5 restaurants from morning til afternoon to get us a last minute day of reservation at a themed restaurant for our 8 person group. Along with free baggage drop off with tips not being accepted as custom goes in Japan, the service here was phenomenal. 5 stars.",5,2015/10/21

Skip the overpriced in-hotel dining options and walk to the many option only a block away. My only complaint is not with the hotel but with Hilton HHonors. Constantly changing member benefits make it almost impossible to take advantage of gold and platinum member free upgrades unless you book directly through Hilton instead of a travel agency or online booking service.",5,2015/10/21
1,REDACTED,en,1343,"We stayed at the Hilton Shinjuku from October 12-18, 2015 using HHonors points. Upon arrival at Narita, we bought a round-trip ticket on the Airport Limo bus to get to the hotel (included a 3-day unlimited Tokyo Metro pass-great value, by the way). 
There was a bit of a wait to check in (the hotel is pretty busy at times, and several of us arrived on the bus at the same time), but staff was very friendly and welcoming. I had checked in online the day before, so just had to get my key. As a Diamond HHonors member, I was upgraded to a fabulous Junior Executive Suite on the 19th floor. Room was very spacious and modern, with nice views of Shinjuku. In-room amenities are very nice, and the shower was amazing.
Breakfast in the main restaurant on the 1st floor was fantastic - so many options, both western and Japanese. Only once did I have breakfast in the Executive Lounge, fewer food options, but quieter, and great views!

I must say that my favorite part of the hotel was the Executive Lounge and their staff. A very special thank you to Yoshimi - she really made our stay even more excellent. We had the pleasure of talking to her every day during our stay - she was there to help out with places to go shopping, suggestions on things to do, etc. When going to the lounge for cocktail hour, she would even ask about our day, if we found what we were looking for while shopping. I really appreciated that. She truly made us feel special and valued as guests. Hilton Shinjuku is very lucky to have her! 

The hotel's location is great - you can walk to Shinjuku Station, or take the hotel's shuttle. There's also easy access to the Nishi-Shinjuku and Tocho-Mae metro stations under the hotel. If you have luggage, I'd strongly suggest using the airport limo bus to/from. It may take a bit longer than the train, but it's so much easier than have to navigate the subway with luggage. 

I wouldn't hesitate to return - and hope to soon! 

Very sincerely,

My girlfriend had let reception know that is was my birthday, so I received an upgrade to a high-floor spacier room, mimosa's for breakfast and two pairs of signature Hilton chopsticks with a very thoughful message, all of which was greatly appreciated.",4,2015/10/20

There is Shinjuku Station just a stone throw away, with a load of bars, restaurants and so on. The only disappointing experience was the mini pool, which I did not use. 
Otherwise this hotel is for sure worth a recommendation",4,2015/10/20

1) Great workout facilities with free weights, machines, small sized lap pool, etc.
2) Good options for early morning breakfast
3) Friendly staff; attentive to special requests

The not as good - 
1) location - little bit of a walk to Shinjuku station, so if its rainy/hot, you might be more inclined to take a cab to get around

1,REDACTED,en,1351,"The Hilton Tokyo was the perfect destination for our family vacation recently. They made us feel so welcome from the moment we were greeted at the front door, and our entire stay with so smooth and easy. We would go back to this hotel in a NY minute (or is that a Tokyo minute?)

In all the hustle and bustle of downtown Tokyo, the Hilton was a welcome respite of peace and tranquility. Every staff member we met was so gracious and accommodating, taking the time to help us get situated after a long flight and jet lag adjustments. The kids were super cranky when we arrived, and the special treatment and great room accommodations made them so much easier to take. Have you ever flown 12 hours with tweens? Believe me, it's the little things that make a big difference, and the Hilton Tokyo made them instantly comfortable. Which made us parents instantly happy. See how easy that can be?

The restaurants are very good - surprisingly, they exceeded our expectations. The steak house was top level, and the Chinese restaurant ( I know, Chinese food in Japan, but the kids wanted it) was also quite good and authentic. Try the Peking Duck. Really!

Adjusting to a new country can be difficult, especially with kids in tow. The Hilton did a very nice job of serving up a perfect combination of Japanese experience mixed with American comfort.",5,2015/10/18
1,REDACTED,en,1352,"My wife and I made this hotel our home base during a recent vacation trip to Tokyo. The hotel is about a 10-15 minute walk from Shinjuku Station. We arrived at the station directly from Narita on the express train which was perfect for two very jet-lagged travelers. We arrived late at night with large suitcases so opted for a taxi which got us there in about five minutes. Check-in at the hotel was pleasant and efficient as you'd expect from Hilton. The room we received was a city view on the 27th floor which gave an awesome view of Tokyo. Furnishings and fixtures seemed new so some recent refurbishment must have been done. Room was on the small side but I was paying with cash + points so hey, it suited my wife and I just fine. Wi-fi was strong and consistent. 

I understand that the hotel has several restaurants; we ate there only one time for the dinner buffet which was really good although a bit pricey. In the lower level of the hotel is a shopping mall with a number of very small, quaint and traditional Japanese food restaurants along with a well-equipped convenience store. The latter was much appreciated so that we didn't have to scout around the neighborhood looking for snacks and water. Although the area around the hotel is pretty quiet after 6:00PM each day, there are enough restaurants close-by that it was easy to find something decent to eat. There's even an American/Japanese Denny's across the street behind the hotel. It was rather unique and I'd suggest it to those who stay here. Across the street from that is a large urban park that was fun to walk around.

We stayed in August with temperatures in the 90's each day and very humid. Nevertheless, the air conditioning in the room kept up and then some. 

All in all a very nice hotel in a decent area close to Shinjuku Station which has direct connections to Narita Airport. It was perfect for our needs.",5,2015/10/17
1,REDACTED,en,1353,"My wife and toddler son were visiting Tokyo for the first time for a four night stay. After reviewing many many hotel reviews and asking friends for a recommendation we selected the Hilton Tokyo. We could not have been more pleased with our choice. The hotel was modern and well kept. We reserved a King Executive room with a city view which was stylish and fairly roomy for us. Our room selection included access to the executive room and breakfast buffet which had a solid breakfast selection and turned out to be a huge benefit at staying at this hotel. There was also access to the subways by an underground walkway which made it convenient for us to explore the city. Most importantly, the hotel staff was kind, very helpful and made our stay memorable.",5,2015/10/17

The Hilton also provided free 3 hour parking for our guests. Like others mentioned room was quiet except for occasions hall noise and the location is easy walking distance to Shinjuku station. Look forward to our next stay when we return to Tokyo.",5,2015/10/17
1,REDACTED,en,1356,"Recently stayed at this establishment for a week. Have previously stayed here multiple times and like its proximity to Shinjuku. A shuttle bus is available every 20mins but the walk (10mins) is also a very easy one.

Hotel was at capacity during our stay due to some holidays around Asia as well as a public holiday in Japan.

I would like to share a positive and negative feedback. 

Starting with negative, I personally experienced some attitude from one of the staff during breakfast at the Marble lounge. Monday was a public holiday in Japan and therefore the hotel was at capacity with waiters running around clearing tables for other guests. I only needed some milk for my tea and an extra tea bag. Instead of disturbing the waiter, as I had to get breakfast from the buffet, I made my way to the coffee making area. I noticed that the pitchers had syrup in them and when asked the 2 members of staff at the coffee station, Mr Ito pointed using his finger that milk was behind him. I acknowledged and asked whether I could have milk in a pitcher for my tea at my table. The other staff member gladly grabbed a pitcher and filled it up with milk (simple task). As this was a tea/coffee station, I asked the same member of staff for kindly assisted me for an extra tea bag, Mr Ito seemed annoyed and make some comments in Japanese to the staff. This left me with a bad taste. As I headed to my table, I shared this experienced with my mother in law (she's Japanese) and she decided to get some mineral water from the same area. When asked for water, she received a totally different service (from grabbing a glass to pouring the water for her when everything is self serve and in front of her). Is it because she is Japanese and I'm not?? I observed Mr Ito over the next couple of days during breakfast and can clearly see that his motivation towards customer service is not his priority (No Omotenashi).

On a positive side, Ms Kobayashi showed great interest in making sure that every guest within her area were well looked after or needed anything. She was always checking for tea/coffee and clearing the table for empty plates. She would engage with making small conversation although she admits her English is not great. This was well appreciated and the effort should be recommended. Ms Kobayashi is an individual with full or energy and takes great passion in what she does. A very great asset for this hotel with great potential of doing very well.

I do hope that this is the exception as this surely does not reflect the Japanese Omotenashi.",4,2015/10/17
1,REDACTED,en,1357,"As always my stays at the Hilton Tokyo have been amazing. My last review gives great detail to my first (and continually ongoing) experience at the hotel, this review will cover my Executive Room upgrade and the benefits that go along with it! This review is a little late and I do apologize! It was written right after my stay and stuck in a save file until now!

As expected, my stay at the Hilton Tokyo has been fantastic! From check in to check out, the staff have been amazingly friendly and the service has been nothing but top notch. My room has always been clean upon arrival and after the housekeeping staff have attended. The Hilton Tokyo has set my standards for what I expect from any property I stay at - worldwide!

This time around I was lucky enough to get an upgrade to an Executive Room with Executive Lounge access, thank you Hilton Gold status, and I can't tell you how amazing it was. While I felt that the room itself and the quality of service I received was at the same fantastic level as it always is, the big difference to my stay was the Executive Lounge access.

On my first night at the Hilton Tokyo myself and my travel companion returned to the hotel after a day of exploration to enjoy some great snacks and beverages in the Executive Lounge. The lounge itself was on the 37th floor and provided some amazing views of Tokyo at night while we snacked on a variety of hot and cold snacks along with a few beverages. There were plenty of finger food options (gyoza, small samples of soba noodles, etc,) and my travel companion stuck to soft drinks while I enjoyed a beer or two (or three, or four...) before heading back out into Shinjuku to find an izakaya for our main dinner.

On the second night we went to the lounge right at opening time and the concierge invited us to a secondary lounge that at the very least I could call a VIP lounge. Smaller, more intimate, with a different selection of finger foods, including caviar, this was an absolutely amazing experience. We spent the whole two hours eating and drinking while we chatted away, to the point where we felt that we really didn't need to go have dinner! The beverage selection was fantastic and included soft drinks, beer, and a fine selection of hard alcohol choices. Time flew by as we ate and drank, and before we knew it we were the last ones in the lounge still enjoying our drinks...30 minutes after it closed! Very sheepishly we apologized to the remaining staff members and made our way back to our rooms to relax for the rest of the evening.

Another big bonus of my Executive/Gold status was the complimentary buffet breakfast in the morning. Hilton Gold will allow me to enjoy the buffet breakfast complimentary in the Marble Lounge on the first floor, the Executive Room will allow me to enjoy it in the Executive Lounge as an alternative. The breakfast itself was fantastic with a wide variety of both Asian and Western selections for breakfast. While I was a bonus to have the Executive Lounge breakfast, I actually enjoyed the selection and atmosphere of the Marble Lounge buffet more. 

Overall my stay at the Tokyo Hilton was nothing short of fantastic, as usual! My Hilton Honors Gold upgrade entitled me to an Executive room with Executive Lounge access which added to my experience, thanks to the free evening beverages and snacks and an alternative place to have my morning breakfast. In all honesty would I book a room at additional cost for Executive access? If it was a corporate booking and the company was paying for it, yes. If it was a personal booking and I was paying for it, no(I would hope my status got me the upgrade at no cost). While the free food and drink from the lounge was enjoyable I would have to make sure I drank/ate the difference in price between a regular room and an Executive room - Which quite possibly could easily be beaten by a reasonable night of food and drink at a local izakaya. I don't want to take anything away from the amazing staff at the Hilton Tokyo - There is a reason I am loyal to this hotel - however as a casual/personal traveller I would find it hard to justify the difference between a Executive room and a standard room unless the price difference is very minimal(less than $30/Y3000 per night).

Overall my rating of the Hilton Tokyo remains 5/5. I'm always recognized as a return customer and a Hilton HHonors Gold member. ALL the staff are extremely polite and courteous. The hotel itself has always been clean, comfortable, and enjoyable. Is the Executive Room/Lounge worth it? Depending on the prices difference and who is paying for it,maybe. There are lots of local eating options which could meet/beat what the difference is between the two, depending on how much you can eat/drink!

Do I recommend the Hilton Tokyo? Absolutely! As I've said many times the staff are amazing, the location is fantastic, and the rooms are always clean. When it comes to a basic room vs an executive room its up to you to compare the prices and decide what is a better value.

My next goal for the Hilton Tokyo - Finding out what the Golden Key Club is all about, and how I get invited to it!",5,2015/10/17
1,REDACTED,en,1358,"From start to finish the hotel and staff were excellent. We arrived at 6am by the airport limo bus from Haneda right to the hotel door. We were there well before check in (2pm) but the front desk were very accommodating and helped us secure a room by 11 and gave us access to the executive floor for some breakfast while we waited. Room was fantastic and large- only downfall is the toiletries provided are not enough. Free bus into Shinjuku station every 20 minutes. The standout service of the concierge staff members was the highlight. They helped to book tours, restaurants and were so helpful.",5,2015/10/16
1,REDACTED,en,1359,"Stayed here as part of a package tour, but we booked one night on our own before the tour. Rooms are comfortably large, with safe and water boiler. We had requested 2 twin beds. Our guide subsequently told us twin beds are the norm in Japan, but the Hilton was out of twin rooms, so they installed a roll-away bed along with the queen sized bed already in the room and gave us complimentary breakfast for the trouble! Could hear some conversations in the corridor, but could not hear any of the street noise below (21st floor overlooking Shinjuku Central Park) except for the rare siren. Breakfast available in the Marble Lounge on the 1st floor beginning at 0630 featured both Japanese and Western fare in their buffet. Easy access from Narita via the Airport Limousine Bus (tip: if you can buy from one of their US agents, the fare in USD can be cheaper than what you'd pay in Yen at Narita!). Would definitely stay here again. Location is 2 blocks from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building and 1 subway stop from Shinjuku Station (or about a 10-15 minute walk).",5,2015/10/16

The room had a nice view over the parts of the city.

My room this time had access to the club room and I thought I would visit early evening for some canapes. I think many other people had the same idea. The club room is quite small, when I arrived at about 5.30pm it was extremely popular and there were no seats available. 

Breakfast in the mornings downstairs in the main foyer were always busy and a short queue waiting to be seated. The choices were great and I really liked the shot glasses of smoothies/juices.

On check in we were informed they would not be available but that the staff could accommodate us in a tower suite and neighbouring room. For a property in Tokyo the room was huge with its own lounge and separate bedroom which suited us perfectly the décor was modern and impressive. The gymnasium and pool, although small are adequate. Beware the tennis courts which are not identified as an additional charge in English although to be fair there may have been a sign in Japanese. These courts carry a cost of 5000 yen which is not cheap. The Hotel offers a regular shuttle to Shinjuku station however the walk is pleasant and interesting either above or below ground. In the basement of the Hotel is a small shopping complex which offers a variety of food offerings and a convenience store.

1,REDACTED,en,1368,"So a Hilton is a Hilton is a Hilton. True up to a point, but a Japanese Hilton adds that little touch of extra. The standards were as you would expect and the restaurants are particularly nice. Try the Japanese restaurant for a terrific taster through sushi/sashimi and also a decent teppanyaki experience. Try the Chinese restaurant for the slightly more challenging sea-cucumber (aka sea-slug) and jellyfish. Breakfast is a decent mix of local and Western, although don't expect a full English as nowhere but here does a good sausage. Having said that, I much prefer to try to eat the local cuisine whenever possible. Service was excellent and if you have other destinations in Japan (as we did) then I recommend you use the luggage forwarding service that most hotels use. For about £7 to £10 you send your suitcases the day before, and then travel light. When you arrive, your suitcases are waiting in the room for you. This hotel is well positioned just above a station so you can instantly access the subway and JR rail networks - and I recommend that even a first time visitor to Tokyo takes a deep breath and has a go. If you can manage London't tube, you can manage in Tokyo.",5,2015/10/11
1,REDACTED,en,1369,"Was here for a business trip with my spouse for a week. Requested a room with a king bed, they gave us a room with 2 single beds.

Second day the bathroom drain backflowed and had sewage all over the floor.

The rooms aren't really sound insulated, we could hear every footstep upstairs.
Moved to another room, had a door adjoining another room - we could hear every word being being spoken in that room.

The breakfast was very good, but didn't like that the waiter were trying to stiff us. I know the difference between 100% wasabi and horseradish. On the first day when I asked for Wasabi they gave me fresh wasabi and it was great. When I asked for wasabi they gave me horseradish, when I asked if this is *real* wasabi they said yes. 

The front desk gave us a very hard time about every little thing. Overall they marred a good experience in Tokyo.
Plus they told me that with my booking I was ineligible to get HHonors points.

We stayed here for 5 days, for work and pleasure. The conference room facilities were exceptional. The restaurants on level 2 are amazing! I spent a lot of time at the bar! I did have trouble getting served at the bar on two occasions (for drinks and a light meal) it was hard to get anyones attention to serve me. However I did get frustrated the second time and raised my voice to get someone to serve me. 
Our safe ran out of battery on the second night so maintenance had to come and open it for us to get our belongings out before we headed out to dinner. I was locked out of my room after a session at the fitness centre because the battery had run out on the locks (who knew about that one?) the maintenance staff were very apologetic for making me wait the 15 mins while they sorted it out. They were really nice.
The hotel is located in a great area, walking distance to Shinjuku station and shops and attractions. The hotel also has a basement with shops and restaurants, this was very handy!

Staffs there are warm hearted and professional, provided the high quality services as always. The days we stay there are the China’s national holidays, so there are so many people, but the staffs could also manage that well, great work! The only problem bother me is the noise in the hall, as there is a canting and as the crewed people, the hall was really noisy.

Due to early starts for work I didn't get to really try out the breakfast but from what I saw it was smaller than some other buffet breakfasts at 5 star hotels I have stayed at in other countries.

With many other western guest with I am the only Asian looking . At first I thought ya , they are very straight on this .so I went all the way down and change to a sport shoes,
When I re enter the lounge, I saw a couple wearing sandals sitting infront of me , that moment I felt so insulting, is it they are European I am Chinese! So I took a picture of them and show it to the staff , they told me they will tell them about it . So waited outside a while and the European couple came out straight and I found no staff personal even tell them about this matter , all I heard is thank you! 
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE , we don't pay the same price? Just don't sell your hotel room to Chinese , ..",1,2015/09/30

Staff were pleasant and efficient.

1,REDACTED,en,1388,"The good: Room was big and very nicely done. We enjoyed the window bench with some nice views. We got great help from the concierge in getting a dinner reservation and a high-end restaurant. 

The bad:
1. Location is a bit off. It's is near NishiShinjuku. it's 15 minutes walk to Shinjuku and the Marounochi line is one of the slowest lines in Tokyo. There is a significant walking to the cool/nightlife part of Shinjuku.
2. A bit of a mishap with our reservation. We booked one reward night as a HHonors member and one paid night. Turns out the reward was for a King room while the paid night was for a Queen room. They couldn't find a room for us for both night (Queen or King, we didn't care). We were asked either to upgrade to a suite for additional 20,000 JPY or take a Twin room. We took the Twin reluctantly. which is not great for a couple on a vacation.",4,2015/09/30

We stayed whilst involved in a conference and while the room was clean and lovely we were dissapointed with the breakfast each day and if we had paid the room rate each day this would have increased our dissapointment. Very knowledgeable concierge staff make sightseeing/eating out a breeze, and if you are looking for higher end accommodation this is a nice option.",3,2015/09/29

We did not eat dinner in any of the hotel restaurants, so I cannot comment on those. The only issue with our room was the shower/bathtub.

Breakfast was lovely, although we couldn't use the foyer restaurant during the day as it was used for other events. We were then sent up to a bar upstairs which had a different atmosphere. 
Getting to and from the airport was made easy and the proximity to subway stations was good. A cab ride from Shinjuku heart was cheap.
The beds were Japanese style - firm futon and very comfortable. Rooms pretty quiet for a big hotel. 
The room we had was a bit tired and needed a lick of paint but it didn't matter as the view more than made up for it. 32nd floor.",4,2015/09/23

Staff were excellent without exception. They were totally helpful but not obtrusive.

The Executive benefits here are superb. There are three options for complimentary HHonors breakfast, including Executive lounge, main restaurant and also a special Diamond restaurant on the second floor. There is also a diamond lounge for drinks which is separate from the main Exec lounge, which makes it quieter but still all the benefits.

I loved the Japanese spa with traditional Japanese bathing and steam room.

1,REDACTED,en,1403,"What a nice surprise! We expected a corporate, standardised look, but the room we got was anything but: a very pleasant Japanese-styled look, with western comforts. The place was spotlessly clean, utterly quiet, and it felt luxurious. The large wet-room shower, with a heated floor, was equipped with a powerful head that kept the temperature stable, and was easy to adjust. The Japanese-type bathtub (short and tall) looked very clean.

We stayed as Honors Diamond members, and we had access to the nice lounge, as well as a choice of two other locations for breakfast, one of which was reserved for HH guests only. The buffet was comprehensive, high-quality, and tasty. The room was a double-upgrade, at no cost, following a declined attempt to offer us a paid upgrade from a one-level upgrade that Diamonds get offered as standard at this location.

Overall, one of the cleanest and very best Hiltons I have ever stayed at with helpful, polite, smiling staff. Highly recommended.",5,2015/09/19
1,REDACTED,en,1404,"This is a great hotel in many ways. First, it's on the ""list.""The hotel is a standard pick up and drop off point for the bus shuttle from Haneda and for Gray Line tours. It's a 10 minute walk or a free shuttle ride from Shinjuku station- a great transportation hub and eating and shopping spot. Second, the service is superb. It is pricy and it was packed the September weekend I stayed. The concierges were excellent and well-informed. They helped me get scarce baseball tickets and arranged a tour and reservations.The bell desk sells Metro passes and a station is adjacent to the hotel. My gold status (or luck) upgraded me to an executive room-worth much more in Asia than in the US mostly because the breakfast is the usual American/Western fare plus a great selection of Japanese cuisine. Hold the hash browns! The restaurants, Chine and Japanese and a grill are very good. (Dynasty is reviewed separately). My roman the 21st (of 38) floor faced the street, had excellent wi-fi, an easy and effective ventilation system, a separate bath and shower, a French press coffee maker, a small minibar fridge, good lighting, and ample outlets. My only complaint was I could hear people using the toilet in the room above me, and like me, he has a prostate issue. There's a very nice park a block away good for jobbing or relaxing or b-ball. I'd definitely stay here again. The only reason I am moving is to be in another part of this huge city.",4,2015/09/19

1,REDACTED,en,1409,"The Hilton Tokyo is just luxury at its best. Once I arrived, staff were there to take my luggage and greeted me instantly. I booked a twin deluxe room and was upgraded to the executive twin with my HHonors gold membership. 

The room was modern, clean and at a pretty good size. Everyday I received complimentary bottles of water, which became a very important amenity during my days going out. I didn't get the chance to try out the executive lounge, due to my busy schedule.

My booking included breakfast at the marble lounge. As a gold member, I was also allowed to have breakfast on the second floor restaurant. The food provided was the same as the Marble lounge, but in a quieter environment, it felt more exclusive and away from the busyness downstairs. The breakfast definitely did not disappoint me, I could imagine that the lunch and dinner would also be at a high standard.

All members of staff were impeccable. I had a slight problem with a private taxi booking to the airport, the concierge was quick to solve my problem and he was extremely polite throughout the process. 

The hotel shuttle was also very helpful during my stay, especially coming back late at night. However, sometimes it is actually easier to travel via the underground passageway to/from Nishi-Shinjuku station, it is connected to the hotel/Hiltopia; only a 8min indoor walk.

I would definitely stay at the Hilton Tokyo again, without a doubt.",5,2015/09/16

1,REDACTED,en,1411,"We booked the Hilton for our 2 night stay in Tokyo back in January, as a result we got a great price for the stay. We joined Hilton Honours and selected the option of an upgrade to the Executive Lounge for a small extra cost. This turned out to be a great deal. We had breakfast with an amazing view - saw Mt Fuji on the first morning - and enjoyed pre-dinner drinks and nibbles one night. 

The room was quiet - none of the closing doors or voices of people in hallways or sounds from other rooms that many hotels have. Bathroom lovely. The screens for the windows and the bathroom - could have a view right through the room to the outside if you wanted - were a nice local touch. The staff were courteous, attentive and helpful - as one would expect in a hotel of this standard. We were able to choose a range of things to preorder, such as types of pillows and a yakuta (all FOC). The yacht wasn't there but we discovered it in a drawer as we were checking out so should have searched a bit harder!

Although we had initially arrived via Nisei-Shinjuku Station, we only rediscovered it as we left on the last day. We should have used it more - changing lines at other stations - as it really was the shortest walk to the hotel. It's down a funny side street though so as you come out of the main doors, you tend to head off towards Tocho-Mae which is signposted. 

We used the questions function on here and subsequently emailed Sam Fan at the Hilton as we wanted a room with a certain view. We searched on TA reviews to find photos of the view we wanted and emailed it to the Hilton man. We were stoked to find that we had a room with almost exactly that view. 

We had the excitement of a 5.0 earthquake on our last morning just as we woke - a bit scary on the 31st floor! An announcement quickly came on in Japanese, then English saying that what had happened and that the hotel was safe. The lifts were stopped for approx 30 minutes while they were checked. Staff were very reassuring and helpful with baggage etc for guests moving out.",5,2015/09/16

1,REDACTED,en,1415,"The rooms, for a city the size of Tokyo, were a very decent size and modern. I love the kimonos they place for your use. The crew was always helpful. I guess this was not unique to the staff cause everyone in Japan just treats people with respect and cordially. The hotel offered a good variety of exercise options. A decent gym, small swimming pool, tennis courts, and a nice sauna and hot tub for you to relax afterwards. The food was very good. The hotel offered 3 different places for breakfast, all with a wide variety of options. The lounge was perfect. During the day, if you are lucky with the weather, you can get a clear view of mount Fuji. The lounge got a bit crowded, but they made sure to accommodate their frequent members in a separate lounge.
The hotel has 2 subways stations within walking distance, the Shinjuku train station is located 5 blocks from the hotel and the hotel shuttle will take you there every 15 minutes. The ""Friendly Limousine"" company will pick you up or drop you off in front of the hotel going to and from Narita airport.
I recommend this hotel for anyone who is going to Tokyo. It can get a bit crowded, but at no point was I kept waiting more than 5 minutes for any service!

Answer: The Tokyo Hilton.

It's big and bustling with lots of activity - but it works.

I stayed for 4 nights on business and enjoyed the experience.

Rooms are well appointed and the bathroom/wet room with the deep bath was great after exploring Tokyo on foot for many hours.

I had room service several times and it always arrived quickly and always freshly cooked.

Overall the team are very engaging and try hard to meet your expectation. (These guys appear like they really want to).

We had the twin executive suite on the 11th floor and we couldn't have asked for a better room. We had an awesome room and we slept on one of the most comfiest beds.

The hotel was in a good location, close to shops and the public transport. Plus the hotel offered a free shuttle bus to and from Shinjuku Station. 

Downside was that Wi-Fi was only free in the hotel lobby otherwise it was an extra charge for the rooms. 

Obviously the price was a little higher than your average hotel however I wanted to splurge a little on this trip and it was well worth every penny spent. Definitely would stay again if I am able to in future.",5,2015/09/01

I like this place.",5,2015/09/01
1,REDACTED,en,1432,"Stayed here in August 2015 two times in a week as part of a business trip. 

Hotel is close to Nishi-shinjuku station, or a short walk to Shinjuku 'main station'. There is also a free bus shuttle service which runs every 20 minutes which is really useful if loaded up with luggage or shopping. 

My checkin was pretty chaotic on both occasions. I'm not sure if it's a new thing with Hilton where they no longer have a dedicated HHonors counter, but I had to wait ages, which isn't what I want after a long trip (I had the same experience with the Osaka Hilton). 

Room was the usual modern Hilton style, which I like, clean and spacious feeling. I had a king room, so the bed was big sized. 

It was clean, the bathroom was spotless, and the bath shower was 'wet room' style, but with a few design faults, the shower head didn't have the adjustment to spray downwards where you're standing. Not an issue, but not very Japanese design standards! 

wifi was free, and it was fast and reliable. Also didn't seem to have the annoying habit of continually asking to re-login. 

Breakfast was downstairs, I had it two times, and had a good selection of both western and Japanese style food. Lovely buttery croissants which I like. Possible to order eggs and so on, and they have decent coffee like lattes if you order it. (you can also order one to take away if needed). One morning I did get somebody else's bill! 

The downsides: 
I already mentioned the chaotic check in. 

The hotel is close to a hospital, so there is the noise of sirens from the ambulances arriving. Could be a consideration if you are a light sleeper to try and get a higher up room. 

The walls were not particularly sound proof, I could hear the lady in the room next to me having a skype conversation home.",4,2015/08/31

Free wifi is a new improvement whilst staying here. The buffet breakfast is vast and you will find just about anything you would want.
The hotel is well located for walking to the shops and restaurants of Shinjuku, and rooms are pleasant if a little smaller than more modern hotels. However, this is Japan, and huge spaces are best placed in public places, and buildings.

We had one beer and one cocktail which was approximately 40-45$ Australian dollars, and food was not cheap either. 

However the standard of the hotel is great and it is in a good location, not too far to walk from shops and close to the park in Shinjuku.

We would stay here again.",5,2015/08/30
1,REDACTED,en,1437,"My husband and I stayed here for a few days at the end of our stay in Tokyo. Check in was very efficient and we were checked into our room early. We received an upgrade to a city view suite which was a pleasant surprise. The room was a generous size with huge windows. shame that the bathroom was very small and a little outdated. 

We found the hotel's location a little sterile but the hotel is a short (10 min) walk to Shinjuku. The hotel has bikes for hire and we spent a day riding to Roppongi and Harajuku - super easy.

The service at the hotel bar also impressed and the cocktails are delicious.",4,2015/08/30
1,REDACTED,en,1438,"We were here for a week, staying in the Executive Floor. The room was clean and comfortable, and staff friendly and efficient. The fact that the hotel is also in a good location makes our stay an excellent and gracious one. Will return, highly recommended.",5,2015/08/29
1,REDACTED,en,1439,The entire staff is outstanding who are led by SAm who is an incredible manager. He went out of his way to help us in many ways. He went above and beyond our expectations. The exc. lounge staff was also excellent. They got to know are likes and were quite to accommodate,5,2015/08/27
1,REDACTED,en,1440,"Stayed in an executive room which is recommended. Nice room, free wifi, bottled water & a nice view overlooking Shinjuku Central Park across the street. The hotel is a 5 min free shuttle bus ride from Shinjuku Station (west side). We enjoyed chilling out at the executive lounge's afternoon teas (3-5pm) and canapes (6-8pm) although it can be hard to get a seat in the evening. Otherwise, it was polite & gracious service all day, everyday. The breakfast buffet and lunch at the Metropolitan Grill were also much enjoyed.
The only problem we had was with (ADD-like?) kids running non-stop in the room above us - not the hotel's fault - but they arranged to move us after the first night.",5,2015/08/26
1,REDACTED,en,1441,"The hotel is not far from the Shinjuku station. They even provide shuttle bus. The room is spacious, full facilities.

1,REDACTED,en,1443,"We stayed for three weeks, and it was a great experience. We wrote to the hotel several times before the stay to request or clarify certain things, and received prompt and clear replies. We asked for a high room and received one on the 38th (top) floor, with a fantastic view. We checked in a couple of hours early, but only had to wait 15 minutes for the room. The fridge was cleared as requested so we could use it for drinks/food. 

The room was to a high standard and a good size, with quiet and efficient air conditioning. The bed and pillows were comfortable. Housekeeping was immaculate. All the staff were very professional, and the Guest Relations Manager (Mr Ferre) was very helpful in making arrangements related to my son’s birthday, for which the hotel provided a complimentary of fruit/chocolate.

The hotel is in a nice and relatively quiet area to the west of Shinjuku station. It operates a courtesy bus to/from the station, every 20 minutes from 8 am or so to 9.30 pm. Otherwise it’s a 10-15 minute walk. An escalator in the lobby leads to underground passages to Shinjuku and the two nearest subway/underground/Metro stations (something I only discovered part way through the stay). The six lifts are effective, with no long waits during our stay. The free Wi-Fi was satisfactory for our needs (internet surfing and sending messages/pictures to family).

I cannot think of any significant negatives. Laundry prices would have been expensive but the hotel gave me a map to a coin laundry, about ten minutes’ walk, where I washed and dried a full load for less than the price of a T-Shirt at the hotel. We did not eat in the hotel, again partly due to cost, but also because we wanted to eat in the city. There is a swimming pool, which is a little on the small size and we only used it a couple of times. There are other facilities such as a gym and tennis courts which we didn’t use.

Although I do not frequently use luxury hotels, I am 56 and used to stay in hotels quite often on business, and have stayed at various Hiltons before. I have to say this was the best hotel I have experienced. My son and I loved it.",5,2015/08/25
1,REDACTED,en,1444,"If you're reading this review you probabily knows Hilton. Well, it's one of the bests I've ever tried.
Hospitality is even too much warm, according both to Hilton 5* standard and Japanese cordiality.
My boyfriend had a room upgrade, so we also had an aperitif in the 37th floor lounge which was really a nice place to have relax time.

The room was huge, clean, with a wonderful bathroom and lovely, urban view.

Breakfast if a triumph of everything:)

This hotel provides a shuttle service from/for airport and Shinjuku JR Station. I'm not sure it's free for the airport, but at least it is for the JR Station.
It's well connected with the metro line Maranouchi (red), even if the underground passage is long and it's quite easy to get lost once arrived at the metro entrance, which is also very close to Shinjulu JR Station.
It's such a labirinth in there:).",5,2015/08/25

Arrived at Haneda Airport and took the airport limousine bus (about 1 hour) that stopped at the hotel. So convenient!

The room was great! No complaint! 

24 hours convenience store is located at the basement of the hotel and you could walk, covered, to the nearest subway station, Nishi Shinjuku station. You could walk to Shinjuku station (about 20mins) or take the subway, which is just 1 station away.

The room is of a good size for Japan and the service at the restaurant and Executive Lounge is superb. The downside is that it is a real busy hotel and the only Hilton I've been to that does not have a dedicated Hilton Honors check-in desk. When I ask the guys at the reception why this is so, I was told that there are too many HHonors guests (200-300) in the hotel! What a lousy answer. 

Best way to get to the hotel from Narita is by the Airport Limousine Bus, stop right in front of the hotel. There is a free shuttle bus to Shinjuku station (right out site Keio departmental store) until 10pm.",4,2015/08/20

1,REDACTED,en,1455,"Upon arriving at Hilton Tokyo, we were politely greeted and immediately helped by the check-in staff - Ernesto was very accommodating and made sure our room - booked via a booking site - was going to suffice for our family of 4 as he feared the room may not be large enough. He held an extra bed for us until we saw the room for ourselves and made a choice. The room was modern and sleek and had plenty of room (King bed and large rollaway bed) as well as modular couch which our teenagers was fine with as one of their beds. 

That evening he suggested a nearby traditional festival rich in Japanese costume/music and culture in Iidabashi, just a short train ride away. After giving us perfect directions we arrived and had a truly unforgettable cultural experience.

The entire hotel was impeccable in service, location, restaurant choices and comfort. Worth the price as this would be far more in the US. Only drawback was the food was very expensive in the hotel - so splurge for a nice meal and than dine at the many inexpensive traditional places within a short walk or train ride.",5,2015/08/13
1,REDACTED,en,1456,"This is my Third times in Tokyo and I choose Hilton for 4 nights with my kids for this visit as we suppose celebrate with my kid and wife birthday in this five star hotel, and i think they could have some special arrangement even need paid, but they are not, i think it just my fantastic and too much expecting on Hilton group.

Pros
- complimentary wifi is provided in the room, of course slowly because it is free.
- there have swimming pool and gym room but i never use as very rush everyday. 
- Free shuttle from hotel to train station three times per hours.
- i loved the bedding, i could sleep very well with good dreaming, very quite room even i stayed at 14/F
- I loved the room size is good enough big as most Japan hotels is very small even could not open the suitcase of some hotel in Japan,
- service is good, but they can more better and better if under Hilton Group.
- They send me a box chocolate for my kid and wife birthday 

Cons
- I tried to book a mini van to airport at Concierge desk and first guy quote me that the price and the mini van was different when next day ask another staff, i don't think will happened on so systemic hotel and found communication break shift to shift.
- The ice machine could be added both end of corridor if possible. 
- No King size bed available on deluxe even requested long times ago. but we put two bed together as i have a kid sleep and prevent fell down on the floor. but i understand subject availability and no exceptional.

Overall, we hoped that excess expecting because it is Hilton Group, however the total experience is only average, If you stayed in four stay hotel, you may think it is ok, we will not stay here again as it was quite far away to walk from food area, of course they had provided shuttle service until around 22:00, but the main problem is it could be get better or more surprise on this price.",3,2015/08/12

It's a bit far from the happening Shinjuku area but they provide a regular bus. 

My biggest pet-peeve? No free wifi, which means the lobby is inundated with wifi freeloaders who lounge around like it's their personal living room. I don't necessarily blame them, but Hilton should offer free wifi - they're in Tokyo and it is 2015.",4,2015/08/10

Their guest services were so awesome. They helped me out with restaurant reservations and told me where to get great food. They get 5 stars.

My room was excellent. I stayed in the King Jr Suite Executive on the 30th floor. The view was amazing. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because of the bed.

They push two twin bed together to make a king. This lead to an uncomfortable line down the middle of the bed. I'm a big guy and I like to sleep in the middle. This made it impossible. I had to sleep to one side. This made me feel like I was being cheated. I paid for a king but slept on a twin. They should have stated it in their website.",2,2015/08/10

The lounge can get crowded especially on the weekend but as HHonors Diamond members we were discretely taken to a second more tranquil lounge so we could relax.

1,REDACTED,en,1467,"We've stayed at many Hiltons around the world, and this ranks near the top. The location is very good being only a .5 mile walk to the main Shinjuku area. Since Tokyo is such a huge walking area, this is really no big deal. If you don't like walking too much, the Tochomae staton is right under the hotel (again, a short walk). This line goes to many of the areas you'll want to see either directly, or with some transfers. The breakfast buffet is a good way to start the morning, and the selection is good. The staff is really helpful and very kind and considerate. They are genuinely nice people who have no problem helping tourists. The only problem we had at the hotel is the internet, and this is a problem we've had with many other Hiltons. Once you log on, and if you don't use your device for even a minute, and it goes into sleep mode, you will have to log in all over again!It's extremely frustrating, and this policy should be dealt with by Hilton. 
Having said this, this Hotel is still really great, and I'd highly recommend it in Tokyo. One tip: do not take the bus to Narita! It takes 2 hrs and is really grueling. Take the express Subway train.",4,2015/08/08

when walking from train, its almost a straight line for about 10 minutes walk. if yuou are not confident with walking cab is fine but pricey for such a short hop. when ordering a cab from train station be sure to annunciate Hilton thus:

'Hill-TONN’ 

that way you will get there easy enough.",4,2015/08/06

1,REDACTED,en,1471,"Stayed for 4 nights on our arrival in Japan.

A very good hotel, and definitely one of the best Hilton hotels that I have stayed in.

Good points:
Location, and a shuttle bus 3x per hour to the main local metro station.
Ok sized rooms.
Very helpful staff throughout the hotel
Room kept spotlessly clean
Breakfast was excellent, great choice and very good quality
Grill restaurant was excellent, although quite expensive.


Didn't like:
Lack of storage space in the rooms. For two adults, the wardrobe space was too small, and nowhere near enough storage space or drawers for clothes. We had to resort to leaving one case open on the floor. Rooms seem more designed for single traveller in terms of space, or maybe guests only staying a few days with little luggage.",4,2015/08/05
1,REDACTED,en,1472,"My husband and I visited Tokyo for the first time in June (2015). Thanks to Hilton Tokyo's Shinjuku location and helpful staff, we were able to see and do everything we wanted to do in Tokyo. 

We stayed with Hilton Tokyo (Shinjuku) for 9 nights. We only were able to use their complimentary wi-fi for seven nights as that is the limit of what they provide. While we were able to use their wi-fi, it worked well and without fail. 

On multiple occasions we used the concierge desk, and it was due to these interactions that we were able to do everything we wanted to do in Tokyo. There are multiple restaurants (such as Alice's Fantasy Restaurant and The Final Fantasy Eorzea Cafe) that are very hard to book online if you don't speak Japanese, or simply won't let you book until you are in Japan due to the need to pick up tickets. The concierge desk worked with us on multiple occasions to not only call restaurants to help us make reservations, but to also help us book tickets on a website in Japanese that we couldn't read. They also printed us confirmations and gave us maps that directed us where to go. As we were preparing to leave, the concierge also helped us to book tickets on the Friendly Limousine bus that drove directly to the Narita Airport (This drive takes about an hour and there are bathrooms on the bus!), and helped us mail back our pocket wi-fi we were renting for our stay. We deeply appreciated their help as they made our trip everything we dreamt it would be. 

Another great perk to this hotel is its connection to the Nishi-Shinjuku Metro Station. To get to this station requires about a five-10 minute walk above ground or the same underground. We were able to walk from the station to this on hotel on multiple occasions without ever emerging above ground. 

The Hilton also has an underground mall connected to it called Hiltopia. This mall has a shop that is open super late. This is a great place to grab drinks, snacks, or quick breakfasts. Hiltopia also has an ATM machine my husband and I used on multiple occasions. 

As for the room, we had plenty of space. The bed was comfortable. The TV has a Blu-Ray player attached to it. We found this to be a great feature! On one of our first nights, we bought cheap Ghibli/Anime DVDs and watched them throughout our stay. When in Tokyo, watching Naruto and Howl's Moving Castle is kind of in the rules. 

The bathroom looked very nice and the hotel kindly provides many amenities (toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, face soap, hairdryer, etc.), but we struggled with the shower. We had come from the Disneyland Hotel that had a shower room, which meant the expectation was the water was going to fall directly onto the floor and go down a drain. In the Hilton Tokyo, there is only a tiny glass divider provided directly next to the shower head, which does not do a great job of stopping the water from getting on the floor. The floor does have a drain, so maybe this is expected? We were entirely confused. The water pressure and temperature were always nice though, so this was just a minor inconvenience. 

A note for vegetarians: Their buffet breakfast does provide many options including pancakes, french toast, an omelette station that is made to order, plain rice, potatoes, cereal, etc. The only ""disappointment"" is that all the edible options for vegetarians are very westernized, which means we miss out on all the delicious looking Japanese options. We enjoyed this breakfast once during our stay, but as we could not eat enough every morning to justify the cost, we instead began eating our breakfast at the Royal Host right outside the hotel. This is Tokyo's version of a much nicer ""Denny's"" that is reasonably priced and also provides basic breakfast vegetarian options.

Overall, we were completely comfortable our entire stay, even with knowing only a little Japanese, and were able to focus on enjoying our time in Tokyo.",5,2015/08/02

This was a big plus on our enjoyable stay (I wish those at Hilton Boston Back Bay would take note!) and we got an upgrade upon checking in through the Hilton app.
The executive suite easily had enough room for my family of four. The city view was excellent from our room. The room itself was well sound insulated, the beds were very comfortable and the air conditioning was very controllable. 
The Executive Lounge access provided a cosy place to relax after the hustle and bustle of the city. On one clear day we saw Mt. Fuji. The breakfast was excellent and snacks provided were very good too. 
The whole hotel is excellent in appearance and cleanliness. Like the reception staff the concierge staff were so so helpful and patient as we tried to figure out where to go and what to to in our short time in Tokyo. Thank you to them for all their help.

Somehow, they completed the check in and informed us to sit for a while to wait for our rooms to be ready.

After waited about 30 minutes , we got our rooms. However, when we entered the room, we found the rooms are like renovation in progress. There were wires everywhere, loose and unmatched furniture. As it was midnight and we were too tired to clarify with the front counter and my sister who had checked in earlier, we quickly showered and went to bed.

The next morning I went to my sister's room, who had booked the same category of room type as mine (she arrived the hotel few hours earlier than me). When I entered her room, I noticed her room was totally different from my room

We went down to the front counter and met the front desk shift leader to clarify the matter. He told us that the night shift staff informed us about the condition of our rooms before they given the rooms to us, and we accepted. This message had made us very disappointed because none of the staff informed us about that. We really can't believe the night shift staff even made up the story about their arrangement. Which mean their intention is very clear to cheat us with the standard rooms for executive rooms. 

After a long talk, the shift leader tried to offer us a dinner at the hotel to settle the complaint, we rejected as we already had other plans. As we were short of time for our other activities on that day, we told him to discuss with his higher management on this issue and we will meet him in the evening for the answer.

We felt very disappointed and regretful not only we had to waste time complaint to them, the irresponsible night shift staff even made the story to cover their action.

Although in the evening on our return, the hotel told us that they arranged to upgrade out rooms to suite rooms. We told them it is meaningless because we need to head to airport early morning the next day. 

We really can't accept such a poor and irresponsible arrangement. This is Hilton, not a budget hotel.",1,2015/07/27
1,REDACTED,en,1482,"I stayed in a King room on the 36th floor. The room was large according to Japanese standards. I had a comfortable king bed. There's a coffee machine, kettle and japanese teapot and cups and a bar fridge. There was a shower over a large bath. I'm happy with the room. I used the gym and pool which were free for guests. Wifi was also free.
My only complaint was that i would have preferred a casual dining restaurant where i could just enjoy good Japanese food without having to pay an arm and a leg. I wish Hilton would start a restaurant that provides authentic Japanese food like one of those small local restaurants.",4,2015/07/26
1,REDACTED,en,1483,"Great hotel! We took the airport limo(bus) to the front door from the airport, it was so easy. The rooms are spacious and well maintained and very up to date. No free wifi in the room but we were on vacation and there is free wifi everywhere in Tokyo. The concierge staff was fantastic and helped us navigate the subway and our way around the city. They even set up a distillery tour for us in the Japanese alps! We absolutely loved our stay at the Hilton! It's important to note that there is a subway stop under the hotel so if you get an all day subway pass its super easy to get back to the hotel after going out into Tokyo. The hotel is located in the quieter part of shinjuku.",5,2015/07/25
1,REDACTED,en,1484,"Stayed here a couple days on a business trip this past week. The room was very clean and modern, and I had a very good dinner at the restaurant on the second floor. There was a long queue to get to the registration desk for both check in and check out, so if you have access to the executive lounge floor, you might try your luck up there. The entertainment in the ground floor lounge was perfect for a post dinner cocktail.",4,2015/07/25
1,REDACTED,en,1485,"Overall the hotel was satisfactory. A little out of the way if you're looking to pack in a lot of sightseeing in a short time, or join the group bus tours - we got dropped off last. The room was adequate but nothing special. The service was mixed - especially at the concierge. One day we had someone who was so helpful, next day the person working there ignored us. But the big highlight of this hotel was the restaurants - very good. We enjoyed the sushi bar and the steakhouse. In general we got the impression that things closed early. We expected Tokyo and this neighborhood to be more lively at night.",4,2015/07/25
1,REDACTED,en,1486,"I stayed at this hotel for nine nights while in Japan on business. The good: The hotel location is sufficient for getting around. There is a complimentary shuttle between the Hilton and Shinjuku Station. You can also access the subway directly from the hotel. The room rate was very reasonable; however everything else in the hotel is relatively pricey. The staff was very professional and friendly.

The not so good: the Internet service was a little slow. The rooms are a bit noisy. I could hear my neighbors above and beside me. In addition, I could hear the staff talking in the hallways in the morning (they were not using their quiet voices). I took to wearing earplugs and that helped. My bathroom was not cleaned daily. Yes, the bed was made and the toiletries were replenished as needed. However the tub and sink were not cleaned daily. I had to bring it to their attention twice. Then the problem was resolved.
I wasn't feeling well one day. I thought I would make it through dinner at the restaurant, but couldn't. I wanted to take my food back to my room to finish as I had barely touched it. I was told no. Now, that was the only thing that really bothered me. The food was expensive and average-tasting at best, but it was what I had. I understand that it is not the norm there to allow carry-out, but I was staying in the hotel for an extended amount of time. If I hadn't been so tired, I probably would have pressed the issue.

Overall: the hotel is okay. I would stay there again given the price and access. I have ways to deal with the minor inconveniences I experienced.",3,2015/07/25

Stuck with no plan b and rotten weather we decided to cheer ourselves up with a night at the Hilton.
Feeling a little out of place rocking up in hiking boots and backpacks we were very pleased with the warm welcome from the staff who didn't turn a hair !!
Our room was lovely with a good city scape view that looked great on our photos!
The pre dinner drinks and hors d'oeuvres were really nice, one staff member, can't remember his name but he was Japanese/American wrote down some easy Japanese phrases for me.

1,REDACTED,en,1489,"I stayed in this hotel during the first leg of my trip. The hotel is modern and sophisticated. The room we stayed in was really nice. Very clean hotel and a excellent location. What made this hotel stand out for me was the staff. They were amazing! The genuinely care about making your stay as pleasant as possible. I had the most nightmarish flight, where luggage was lost and to make a long story short, the customer service from the flight were not concerned with helping me find my luggage. The staff at the Hilton, kept in touch with the airport and followed up for me. When I got there they already knew about the luggage, they upgraded my room for free because they felt bad about something that was not their fault. They helped facilitate everything for me from helping me purchase movie tickets, to helping me send luggage to my next location. I have stayed at Hiltons before, it has never been this great! I can't thank the staff enough! Food was very good and service amazing but expensive, but you know the saying you get what you paid for.",5,2015/07/23
1,REDACTED,en,1490,"Stayed here for 2 nights on first trip to Japan. At check-in was informed that despite Gold status, lounge access denied because ""it is small and only linked to Exec room"" (which they would not upgrade us to). I did not expect an upgrade, but did expect lounge access. If it cannot accommodate all Gold and Diamond members, maybe they need to enlarge it. The hotel is very large. In fairness, they did offer breakfast in HH area, which was plentiful and varied and away from the noise of the lobby restaurant. The room is well appointed with an excellent shower. View is fantastic. Service is generally very good as staff aims to please, provided requests are within their rules. Case in point: while waiting for the airport bus, I asked the concierge for a bottle of water. Was told to go buy one in the convenience store in the lower level shopping arcade. Really?? Was it because I used Hilton points for stay? Cannot recommend this hotel.",3,2015/07/22
1,REDACTED,en,1491,"Front desk was great when we checked in. She got us all together on the same floor and access to the Executive Lounge. The breakfast buffet was great with lots of choices and the food was excellent.

1,REDACTED,en,1493,"Our stay was fine -- the room was nice, the staff were professional, the breakfast was good -- but it was a bit hard to enjoy because the lobby and the executive lounge were crowded (and I mean crowded, as in hard to move through) every time we went to either. Perhaps the hotel is a victim of its own success. The serenity of the Conrad makes it worth the premium if you are a Hilton loyalist in Tokyo. Also, a very important point: we could hear EVERY WORD of the people in the room next to us. Fortunately, they went to sleep around 10:30, so it wasn't a problem.",4,2015/07/19
1,REDACTED,en,1494,"It is a bit of a walk from Shinjuku station but it was pretty enough with all the government buildings around. There was a Denny’s next door for those who weren’t willing to pay the very, very expensive price for breakfast. The beds were wonderfully soft, very American-style, and the hotel itself was gorgeous. There was a safe in the room. The staff were extremely helpful. We had booked 2 nights there and then we were there for 2 nights with a tour and while they couldn’t accommodate us by letting us stay in the same room (different levels of status?), they moved our packed luggage to the new room without hesitation. Lovely place. I would recommend it.",5,2015/07/19
1,REDACTED,en,1495,"2nd stay, and I still love the place. Efficiency & quality epitomised. Stayed on Executive Floor again & it was just perfect for me. Quiet calm breakfast & civilised cocktails in the evening. Excellent. Rooms here are quiet, comfy and immaculate. As a stopping point for airport buses it make this a convenient spot for NRT/HND too. Access to all that TYO has to offer from here makes this a great tourist spot. What more could you need? I will return for sure.",5,2015/07/18
1,REDACTED,en,1496,"From check-in to departure, the hotel was a joy to stay in.
The room was spacious, modern and extremely comfortable - where do they source their bed linen?! Everything was at hand - including coffee and tea and an international power point in the room, the gym, pool and fabulous bars and restaurants.
And of course, the fabulous location, close to Shinjuku station.
Having access to the executive lounge made our stay that much more comfortable especially after checking out we could relax before our flight.
We would definitely stay at the Hilton again when we return to Tokyo.",5,2015/07/18
1,REDACTED,en,1497,"Stayed for two nights in the Junior Suite. Rooms are modern and nicely designed. Had a great view from room.
The Executive Lounge was on a high floor and had a nice view of the Shinjuku skyscrapers. The bar on second floor was nicely decorated and had live music. Only downside was that drink orders (cocktails) took 15-20 min to arrive.
Sushi restaurant was fantastic (for which I will write a separate review).
Breakfast in the lobby downstairs is quite busy, but the quality of food is good. You can reach the metro through a walkway and the hotel also has a shuttle bus to Shinjuku. 
Overall very pleasant stay. Would definitely recommend.",5,2015/07/18

The staff, food and drink in the Executive Lounge was very good. 24 hour access to gym is available. I found it very helpful that Airport Limousine bus had a stop at the Hilton ... easy $25 trip to/from Narita that takes about 1.5 hours. 

I tried each of the restaurants once. I found them to be expensive for the quality of the food received. I'm sure they cater to travelers on expense accounts.",5,2015/07/16
1,REDACTED,en,1503,"This was the last hotel we stayed at on our 2 week Japan trip. The Hilton staff (i've come to experience) has great attention to detail, is very helpful, and always very friendly. Their executive lounge was the busiest I've even been to (I had signed up for a credit card that gives me Hilton HHonors Gold Status and which allowed me to use the executive lounge for free ... the card also gives upgrades (if available) and we did get upgraded to the second-lowest-tier). Bartender made drinks, pretty good local food ... all for free.

One young guy setting up the 6pm cocktail canapés told another guest please do not touch at 5.55pm, whilst others had obviously took from the table when he went back into the kitchen. It is understandable but the word choice of ""please do not touch"" is offensive. I too had a moment of ""please do not touch"" when I spilled some hot water at the executive desk, a young female staff was friendly to rush off to find a towel for me, the other gentleman by her side at the desk looked annoyed also said to me "" please do not touch anything"" when I was trying to minimize the mess with my napkin. 
Think the staff need a bit of training with the use of language, perhaps the male staff...""",3,2015/07/13
1,REDACTED,en,1509,"Spent 12 nights at this perfectly located property in Tokyo. As a tourist you have easy access to 2 subway stations on 2 lines via underground passage from the hotel lobby. I had a executive queen room which is pretty nice, but it's the best. The room itself gets 4 stars. While comfortable and very well equipped, the lack of channels of it's TV is quite frankly ridiculous. Wifi worked great the entire time with upload and download speeds were good. Breakfast in the Marble Lounge each day was good although the egg station, while understandably busy, needs to cook eggs fresh and not have them on a plate waiting. Not proper. Loved the executive lounge and considered it well worth the cost of upgrade. Now the best for last. The staff. This property has to have the one of the best hotel staff that I have ever encountered. Extremely polite, courteous, and professional in every manner. This hotel isn't perfect, but it's close to it.

In every part of the building there was nice staff. 
The breakfast buffet was great, a wide variety of both Japanese and Western options. The lounge itself had less options, but it was less crowded and even friendlier staff. Tranpsort from Narita airport is very well organized: the aiprort limousine takes you from door to door in around 90 minutes. Another great thing about he hotel was that you coukd walk to the subway station underground through Hiltopia, Hilton underground shopping mall; especially very handy eith the rain we had when we visited. 
OverAll, great expeeience at this user friendly hotel!",5,2015/07/10
1,REDACTED,en,1515,"We are Hilton honors gold members. As soon as we arrived off of the Airport Limousine bus from Narita Airport, we were greeted promptly! (I chose this hotel because the Airport Limousine bus drops you off right in front of the property.) We had ordered a pocket-wifi from Global Advanced Communications and it was there at check-in, also.

Our room was on the 35th floor and the views from our room were magnificent. As soon as we settled in our room we went next door to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building (free ride to top of the building) and saw more superb views of Tokyo. On a clear day you can see Mt. Fuji, but it was a cloudy day for us. 

The breakfast buffet both Western and Japanese was delicious! I truly enjoyed the cooked to order eggs and the pastries and also the miso soup and rice with all the fixings, too. The service was truly outstanding. 

We used their luggage service desk to send out our luggage to the hotel in Kyoto on our check-out day. I recommend that highly! Thank you Hilton Tokyo for living up to the expectations that others had written on Tripadvisor!",5,2015/07/10
1,REDACTED,en,1516,"For a family of 3 we had a Junior Suite which was very large by any standards, let alone Tokyo. The room was very well appointed and had a good view (32nd floor) and was a very reasonable price for what it was. The wi-fi was reliable and fast. Breakfast was included which was of a good standard for a hotel like this. 
This is obviously principally a business hotel with appropriate facilities - gym, indoor pool, business centre, several (very expensive) restaurants and good transport links to the airports by limousine bus. There is a basement shopping arcade with a convenience store, the elusive ATM that will accept international cards and a few local restaurants. 
As you would expect the service was very good.
Overall this is a great package - the only downside is that it is surrounded by office blocks and other large hotels and completely lacks that Shinjuku vibe. For that you either have to take the hotel shuttle to the station (free every 20 minutes), walk 15 minutes or if its raining like it was the entire time we were there - take a taxi (730 yen). 
No big deal if you are there on business and only a minor annoyance if you are on holiday - but enough to make us think that next time we would look for a more convenient location.",4,2015/07/09

Upon check-in, I was upgraded to an Executive Suite as a Hilton blue member...essentially I have no status, but it was a nice surprise. The room entitled me to breakfast each day in their Honors Lounge as well as drinks at night. This was unexpected delight.

The hotel is nicely located, you are a short walk from a lot and a 15 minute subway ride from Downtown. The best part is an underground tunnel system that leads you to 2 subway stations, so you can easily find where you need to go.

I was not here on business, but on pleasure for 4 days. Key points:

- Friendly staff, accommodating to a Westerner.
- Great concierge, very helpful
- Close to subway stations and convenience stores and casual restaurants
- Inside there were two bars a few restaurants.
- Direct delivery from Narita via the limousine bus shuttle....door to door, helps when you are jet lagged vs. the subway.
- Clean spacious rooms
- Great amenities in the room.
- Polite and professional staff

Take my advice and stay here. Great job Hilton Tokyo!",5,2015/07/08
1,REDACTED,en,1521,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Hilton Shinjuku for 4 nights with my sister. Situated in the hotel district, it is walking distance to Shinjuku itself and the main train station. If walking is not an option, the hotel offers complementary shuttle buses to the station, however we did not use this service.

We stayed in a standard room which, while small, was noted as being large by Japanese standards. The bed was comfortable and while we did not select a room with a view, still had a decent lookout at Shinjuku. The bathrooms were very small however, and do not fit two people at the basin.

The lobby is grand and smells heavenly upon entry. Included in our rate was daily breakfast, which boasted a large selection of hot and cold items, both Japanese and Western. We did find problems with breakfast service however, with our entire table, full coffees included, being cleared while getting up to grab something else from the breakfast selection. Upon return, having to be seated and asked for coffee all over again. Even after trying to leave a coat or a personal item at the table, this still continued to us and other tables around us.

Checkout and checkin both went smoothly, however as the Hilton is notably a large hotel, we did on occasion feel like 'just another number'.

In saying that however, there is no other hotel that we would have preferred to stay, and will likely return to the Hilton when we travel to Tokyo again.",4,2015/07/08

Within 5mins after a call to the front-desk, i was changed from the non-smoking room to a smoking room. The view from the room was fantastic as i stayed on a top floor. Breakfast was good and sumptuous. 
The hotel's location makes it convenient to move around. I rented the bicycle (for free) and cycled around to get to know the surroundings better. Within 10mins of walk, you are able to reach the Shinjuku station area, There are plenty of eateries there- especially those lined up along the alleys.
There is also a shuttle service from the hotel to Shinjuku station.

Bed was very comfortable, pillows were perfect, bathroom perfectly laid out, and shower was excellent. Breakfast buffet, though pretty typical, had lots of choose from and the quality was excellent. Choices of restaurants in the hotel are many however in Shinjuku, all you need to do is walk to any large building and there will be dozens more to choose from.

The fitness centre was very equipped and busy and the pool also is very good.

There is a restaurant pub on the 2nd floor. Visited their fitness center with a nice pool & tennis court on the 5th flr, I believe. You see a lot of people walking. There are nearby restaurants if you don't want to eat at the hotel. And once you get to Shinjuku station, you can just walk around--department stores that sell tech stuff, designer clothing, household items, etc. And there's also some nearby smaller stores; lots of video arcades where any teenager would go nuts; smaller restaurants where food prices were cheap just follow the crowd. We felt safe walking around even at night but we kept track of our shuttle schedule where the last pick up was at 9:40 pm. And at the end of the day, it was just so nice to head back & sleep comfortably in our cozy room. Also, it was the start of the rainy season, so it intermittently rained during the 4 days we stayed there, but the hotel gladly lent us some umbrellas which was really great. Overall, my family & I had a wonderful time.",4,2015/07/07

We felt like elite guests!

The hotel is in a very convenient location----close to the fun of Shinjuku but also in a part of town that's classy. Of all the areas in Tokyo, Shinjuku was my boys' (ages 18 and 20) favorite.",5,2015/07/06

I stayed at a business room at the 25th floor, and I found it very comfortable, with a impressing view. The service was simply outstanding, and the business lounge offered a wide variety of food, drinks and snack, including wine in the afternoon. 

I will definitely stay here again.",5,2015/07/03
1,REDACTED,en,1532,"Great experience recently at the Hilton Tokyo.

After spending time on this trip at other hotels in more rural Japan, it was fantastic to return to the comfortable familiarity of the Hilton.

This is a busy and large hotel, but despite this they still manage efficient and personable service.

As a Hilton Honors Diamond member I received an upgrade to a deluxe room which was unexpected and appreciated.

The refurbished deluxe rooms are great, large in size and with an amazing shower!

Executive Lounge offerings were good, though it does get very busy.

A fantastic buffet breakfast too.

Where the Hilton really shone for me on this trip was the fantastic new restaurants on Level 2.

We ate at both the Metropolitan Grill and Junisoh.

The food at both was exceptional, with the teppanyaki at Junisoh being a great experience.

Note the restaurants are quite expensive and you will find better value outside of the hotel, but the food and service was exceptional.",5,2015/07/03

Highly recommended",4,2015/07/01
1,REDACTED,en,1539,"Of all of the hotels in all of the cities I've visited, this was by far the most beautiful hotel. While Tokyo is expensive, this hotel was worth every penny. It's modern/American bathroom made it easier to use (showers in Japan are sometimes tricky to use for taller people, and I learned that the Japanese typically take baths) than others I encountered on my trip. The hotel dining was delicious, and the staff was exceptional. I felt welcome from the moment I stepped in, and the waitress at the breakfast buffet remembered my family, and even where we had planned to travel, from the day before!

The hotel is very conveniently located. The breakfast buffet was excellent, the dinner buffet also very good at about $50 a person. The room was large, well appointed and quiet, despite the fact that the building itself is next to a major university hospital facility. The public transportation - subways - were very close and easy to use. The staff at the hotel was incredibly friendly and attentive. We felt ""taken care of"" by everyone we came into contact with. The lobby is a very busy place, and it is evident that the hotel is well managed. The menus of the restaurants on the 2nd floor were really over priced, and we did not have any meals there. There are plenty of other restaurants within walking distance that were much more reasonable.",5,2015/06/30
1,REDACTED,en,1541,"Hilton Tokyo is located very close to Shinjuku station, and we walked to station in about 10 minutes. There is a hotel shuttle that drops near the Keio/Odakyu stores near west gates. We used it many times when coming back from trips.

The rooms we had (executive king / junior suite) were nice, with separate working area in the suite, which I used for work after the trips during my business meeting. There were Japanese style robes in the room and tea/coffee making facilities, but the lounge on 37 is also open for tea / coffee whole day.

Breakfast in ground floor restaurant as well as second floor lounge was good with a very large selection of Japanese style and regular European type items. Made to order eggs were nice as were fresh mixed fruit drinks.

The executive lounge at 37th floor was a nice welcome after a long flight from Europe. We went there after a nap and enjoyed the view, champagne, and small bites of food before heading out to Shinjuku for dinner. We were taken to the smaller lounge which is only for hilton members and it was nicer and quiter than the main lounge.

Hotel reception staff (as well as every single person I interacted with) are excellent. They arranged our airport transfer, stored the luggage when we went to Kyoto for a week and upon return the stored luggage arrived in room as soon as we were in!

Overall 10 days in this hotel were very comfortable. Will return again whenever in Tokyo next time.",5,2015/06/30

The location is good, it near metro station. There is airport bus stop direct in front of the hotel. Also hotel provides shuttle bus service to Shinjuku JR station.
There are some restaurants and a supermarket nearby. 
The room is clean and big enough for Tokyo standard.
It is a big hotel in Tokyo, I know the staff is tried to be nice to everyone, but there are too many people, I can't feel the personal service. The hotel lobby is always full of people.
I think this hotel is more suitable for business travel.",4,2015/06/30
1,REDACTED,en,1543,"This hotel is located in the skyscraper district of Shinjuku. The rooms are large with beautiful views. No noise of traffic but we could hear the thumps from neighboring rooms. Wifi was free but not strong. Tv offered very few English language stations. The hotel has several restaurants and bars but the prices are very high, particularly for alcoholic drinks. We had a drink and a sandwich at the Zatta bar and went to the rooftop beer garden where the chairs and tables are plastic and you have to get your own drinks from a portacabin but the cost is 1000 yen a drink or 3500 for as many drinks you want in half an hour. The hotel is an easy walk from Shinjuku station. A pleasant stay but I don't think I would stay here again.",4,2015/06/29
1,REDACTED,en,1544,"The main thing the hotel has going for it is the location, a 8-10 minute walk from Shinjuku station. 
The hotels also runs a shuttle to the station every 20 minutes.
Check in was smooth, and here a special mention must be made of Ernesto who was exceptionally warm and welcoming, with some genuinity rather than in the same robotic fashioned way common in Japan. Apart from repeatedly telling us to let him know if we needed anything at all, he also changed our room from the 12th floor facing the tennis court to the 36th floor (3602) with a magnificent city view! That too without us asking! Clearly deserving to be in the hospitality line!
That is the primary reason I have given the hotel a good review rather than above average, coupled with the really efficient and very very helpful concierge!
Each and every one of them was always ready to assist.
The rooms itself are like normal hotel rooms, carpeted, the bathroom is a bit small with a bathtub and no separate shower, along with being a bit dated.
One thing the hotels needs to get rid of it change is the desk in the rooms which have these protruding steel legs, which are not conducive to limited space, and my husband banged his foot into it many times, getting hurt and also was very painful each time!We paid little above 250 USD which was fine, but anything g more than that would be too much for this hotel.
Not having a room with the view would have changed my perspective a fair bit in all honesty.
The hotel is connected to Maranouchi line subway.
The hotel was very full and the lobby like a fish market.
We did not have breakfast so can't comment.

All in all would like to try a different hotel for variety but if didn't get similar comforts for this price, would be happy to stay again.",4,2015/06/29
1,REDACTED,en,1545,"When travelling on business half way around the world for a full week, its nice to know Hilton in Tokyo provides a home like experience if a far away land. If i were on vacation i would be inclined to emerse myself in the local culture, a boutique hotel or Maybe a quaint Bed and Breakfast. Trying to conduct business, deal with jet lag, inevitable language barriers, logistical nightmares, etc its just comforting and reassuring to dwell in comfort of a first class Hilton Hotel. I could have been in NYC, SFC, Chicago or Boston, the surroundings were so familiar. Great restaurants and Bar on site. Pool, spa and health club with all the ammenities. Hospitality, friendly and polite staff..all the creature comforts one needs to relax and reinvigorate after a long day of work.
The restaurants were simply amazing choices of cuisine, expertly prepared, elegantly served, choice of asian, western, Japanese dishes. Did i mention how polite and accomodating the staff are? Beyond imagination. 
Conveniently located in the Shinjuku area, just a couple blocks from lively restaurants, bars, designer stores, and a single block of naughtyness if your so inclined! A reasonable 45-60 min taxi from Narita, or take a cheaper shuttle bus.
Definitely a repeat in the future! Room prices typical business class. Restaurant on site a bit pricey, but worth it!",5,2015/06/28
1,REDACTED,en,1546,"Right, so a little background before I go into this review...
As part of my gold airline membership benefits back in Australia, I was able to take advantage of a gold membership with one of two hotel chains. I chose Hilton.

My Hilton Hhonors gold membership card had not arrived with me prior to departing for my trip, but I had my member number in one of my email accounts.

Hilton Shinjuku was my last - and longest stop - on what was my first ever visit to Japan and I'd just received the most amazing service at each of the hotels I'd stayed in in Osaka, Kyoto and Hiroshima. 
And to be honest, I was actually looking forward to staying at Hilton Shinjuku.

After an officious “welcome” by the staff member on check-in (she was seemingly perturbed that I was unable to locate my Hhonors member number during the check-in process and became dismissive when she couldn't find it herself on the computer system), I was presented with the card to my room.
On entering the room I discovered that they’d put me in the incorrect room; a King Deluxe, instead of the more expensive King Hilton I’d paid for. I then called down to reception to both let them know that I was in the wrong room and my member number, which I’d managed to locate in an email.
As soon as said staff member entered my details into the system, her demeanour changed instantly and she became incredibly apologetic, seemingly surprised that I was a gold member, referring to me as “sir” etc. 

She advised me that there were no King Hilton rooms available for my first night, but that she would upgrade me to an Executive Suite for the remainder of my stay with full access to the executive lounge to make up for it. I was to leave my room card at reception and my case in the room and pick up the new room card when I arrived back at the hotel later on my second day, which I did. 

For the remaining five nights, yes, I did have access to the executive lounge, but was accommodated in the King Hilton suite which, though comfortable, was the room I’d paid for in the first place and not the Executive Suite I was promised (Gold Hhonors members are also meant to receive ""space-available upgrades"").

I didn’t used the executive lounge, I didn’t use any of the facilities in the hotel as part of my stay. I wasn’t given the wifi password, I didn't receive the complimentary continental breakfast (also supposedly a perk of being a gold member), nor did I visit the restaurant(s). 
I felt relatively unwelcome from the moment I stepped foot in front of the reception desk and spent as little time as possible in the hotel as a result.

On my return from Japan, and on finding out that I'd not earned points for my stay due to booking the room via a third party website (one must book via Hilton's own website to earn points, I later found out), I sent emails to the Hhonors Guest Services team to cancel my membership. 

To be fair, the staff members at Guest Services were pretty good and though incredibly apologetic about my experiences and offering various forms of compensation to keep me as a member, their responses were cut and paste jobs and therefore smacked of insincerity. Not exactly the type of responses you'd expect as a gold member.

The last email I received from them started (quote);

""Thank you for contacting Hilton Guest Assistance. My name is ******(edited to protect identity). It will be my pleasure to assist with the room suite type unavailable, front desk staff, disappointed with over all experience during your stay and did not earn HHonors points due to third party booking at the Hilton Tokyo on April 12, 2015.""

At the base of each of Hilton's emails to me was the sentence, ""Hilton Worldwide strives to offer the world’s best customer service in every interaction.""

At both the hotel check-in and with my later email dealings with them, they failed to deliver.

Suffice to say, I'm no longer a Hilton Hhonors member and will not be staying at their hotels in the future because of my experience at Hilton Shinjuku.

I think the real kicker about my experience was that... I stayed at ANA Crowne Plaza in Osaka, Hotel Anteroom in Kyoto and Sheraton Hiroshima during my Japanese visit, am not a member with any of those hotels, but was treated infinitely better as a customer in each of them than I was as a gold member at Hilton Shinjuku.

To me, that speaks volumes.

The hotel itself? 
The rooms are well appointed, compact and comfortable, though I stayed in better and more modern during my visit to Japan. There's no free wifi.
Location's pretty good, with a connection via an underground passageway to NishiShinjuku subway station. Though if you have trouble walking for more than ten minutes, it might be best to catch a cab out front.
There are restaurants and convenience stores close by.

I'm not going to totally shaft the Hilton Shinjuku by giving it just one 'star'; it does everything a modern hotel should do in providing reliable, comfortable accommodation. 
It gets a 'star' for delivering on that and another star for the amazing service I received from the man at concierge as I was literally leaving the hotel for the very last time, who was friendly, helpful and courteous. 

If Hilton Shinjuku had more people like him working for them and if only he was my first impression instead of my last, they would be dazzling here with more than the two stars.

As it stands, however, they've lost a customer for life.",2,2015/06/26
1,REDACTED,en,1547,"The hotel was very modern and updated. Overall, the service was great except a front desk lady wasn't very friendly when we checked in the second time for our stay. It was very unusual for Japanese service. We could tell that she wasn't Japanese. The hotel location wasn't very close to the Shinjuku station but they offer free shuttle around the station from 8 a.m. to 8:45 p.m. Overall the stay was great but front desk service could be improved.",4,2015/06/25
1,REDACTED,en,1548,"I had a very high quality experience 6 nights at the Tokyo Hilton in Shinjuku. 5 nights with 2 standard rooms and 1 night with 2 king suites for a family of 4. Furnishings and bathrooms were top notch. The bed was very comfortable if you like beds that are a little bit on the firmer side. Service was great in the room, in the breakfast restaurant, and in the Executive Lounge. For Hilton Honors members at the Diamond level you will be very happy with either of the buffet breakfasts (in the main dinning area on the first floor or in the Executive Lounge) which both include American style (eggs, bacon, pancakes, cereal) and Japanese style (fish, miso, pickled items, tofu) breakfast items. Dinner in the executive lounge had enough substantial food to keep you from paying elsewhere or was a nice place to grab a few appetizers and a beer before going out. The shuttle bus to the Shinjuku Train Station was extremely convenient and taxi rides to Shinjuku restaurants were about $7-8 one way. As many may already know, you don't need to tip at the hotel or in the taxis which is quite a nice change from the US and many other places abroad! English was spoken well by most of the hotel staff. I had Japanese friends in town and did not need to use the concierge so I can't comment on that. We went off to Hakone for one night by train and the hotel was very happy to store our excess luggage overnight for us. As it seems with most Hiltons, the free wifi is available, but very, very slow (to the point of being almost too slow even for web-browsing) most of the time, but the paid premium wifi worked well. I hated to leave the Hotel... it was a great place to spend a week!",5,2015/06/25
1,REDACTED,en,1549,"This Hilton hotel is a lovely hotel & well located to the sights in Tokyo. We visited in January which was a busy time of the year, however the check in staff were friendly & the process very efficient. We arrived at the hotel on the limousine bus which you can board at the Shinjuku station & it was a short trip to the hotel. The rooms are spacious & easily accommodated 2 adults & a child. We ate in the marble lounge restaurant which offers a buffet breakfast & the food and service were very good & value for money. 

The Subway is located near the entry to the marble lounge & easy to find, just follow the steps which lead down to the subway which is well signposted. The subway also has restaurants, shops & a small store, which can be handy to buy any necessities. The hotel is close to the TMG for views of Tokyo for free instead of Tokyo tower which has a huge line up. There is also a beautiful park nearby, which is great for kids.",4,2015/06/25

We were upgraded to the Executive Floors and Lounge so that was a nice plus. Breakfast buffet had plenty of Japanese and Western options. Easy walk to JR Shinjuku station (5 mins) with plenty of eating options all around the area.

Breakfast had masses of choice and good quality.,5,2015/06/24
1,REDACTED,en,1553,"As always, the Hilton in Shinjuku never fails to disappoint.

From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave, the staff are there waiting on your every need. Before you've even left the taxi your bags are being removed and carried onto the hotel.

My preferred room is the Junior Executive Suite. It's a very good size room with excellent city views and all the amenities you can need.

This time my flight left Haneda at 12.30am the next morning, so I wondered how to handle this. Being a Gold member they allowed me to check out at 15.00 and stay in the executive suite until I was ready to leave at 20.00. That can't be faulted. They even took my bags away and kept them until I left.

As always, a pleasure to stay here.",5,2015/06/23
1,REDACTED,en,1554,The airport limo bus stops at the Hilton which is really convenient. Big rooms. Loved the decor with the Japanese horizontal sliding window shades. The bathroom setup was very nice with shower and tub and glass surround. Desk area was comfortable. The free Wifi had 2 hiccups that frustrated me while there and assume it was load related. I was on a high up floor both stays and the city views were so nice. Executive lounge for breakfast was quiet and good for a small quick bite (low quality if expecting a big English breakfast but I won't knock it too much). I really liked the location just outside the bustle of Shinjuku station.,5,2015/06/23
1,REDACTED,en,1555,"One of the joys of Japan is that stuff just works as it is supposed to. Few failures. No excuses. It's part of the culture. So when you go to a downtown Tokyo hotel -- especially a Hilton -- you expect excellence, and this facility delivers. 

It is within walking distance of the Shinjuku station and is connected by tunnels to the Nishi-Shinjuku subway station. You can eat, sleep, and go with near zero hassle. 

The hotel is expensive and the breakfast buffet, though excellent, is nearly $30 with the discount you can request at the front desk. The place gets a 10 for performance on all dimensions, but expect to pay for that high level of service

English in the hotel is the best in Asia, not native, but perfect comprehension even for idiomatic expressions. The staff are friendly and efficient, a rare combination. 

You can get to the hotel as a direct stop using the airport limousine bus from either Haneda or Narita airports. Though the train may be technically faster the limo bus is much more convenient. 

The gym is well-equipped, but small. Very little room for sit-ups and push-ups. Just a lot of well-maintained machines and weights. 

Internet is fast and free and low hassle, but the rooms lack sufficient electrical outlets for the modern connected traveler. 



Enjoy your stay.",5,2015/06/23

1,REDACTED,en,1557,The rooms were really large and quite personalised for a Hilton as the windows had blinds which looked very Japanese. The hotel is a little out of the centre but you can get the free shuttle either to or from Shinjuku station which is free. The hotel sorted out our bus tickets back to the airport and added the cost to our room which was also good meaning you do not have to keep Yen for the journey. Across from the hotel is a Starbucks so you can get your morning coffee. Would definitely stay here again.,5,2015/06/22
1,REDACTED,en,1558,"We stayed here back in December 2014 and requested for an early check-in as we reached NRT in the morning. The hotel unable to honour our request probably due to the holidays peak period so we have to leave our bags at the concierge. The hotel was busy and the queue to check-in was longer than expected. It took slightly longer to check-in and our room was not available for early check-in. So we went for a quick tour and took the shuttle to Shinjuku station. The hotel provides a regular scheduled shuttle to/from the Shinjuku station which is very convenient if you need to take the JR trains. Alternatively, the metro station is a short walk from the hotel. Its quite convenient to get from Narita Airport to the hotel as the airport limousine bus stops right at the doorstep.

We tried the buffet restaurant for breakfast and a couple of evenings for dinner; which were great with ample choice for Eastern and western tastes. The steak restaurant on the first floor provided us with great steaks after all the fish we had eaten!

Terribly noisy from both sides of the room, especially after 10pm when people seemed to come back to their rooms. Needed to use white noise and ear plugs to get to sleep.

The other major issue was the terrible internet - on the Monday night, Wednesday night especially, it basically stopped working to impossible crawl at 9pm through after midnight, making it virtually impossible to do calls and exchange files with the US.

The other nights were almost as bad. Impossible to work.

Both challenges made this a very unhappy stay at the Tokyo Hilton.",2,2015/06/21

WiFi was excellent in room and all the staff at this Hilton were very friendly and accomodating. Location is quiet and bit of a distance to central Shinjuku but free shuttle and a bit of a walk underground to the subway can take you where you want to go. Concierge service is slow at times and we did not opt for breakfast but dined at buffet twice for breakfast and once for lunch taking advantage of 20% extended stay discount. Both good but if had every day for a longer stay it is the same every day.

Before our stay, Hilton helped us book Jiro Roppongi and we got the night we wanted. The staff here can also organise a bus for you if you need to depart to Haneda or Narita airport. Stayed six nights and for what you pay it's well worth it.",5,2015/06/18

1,REDACTED,en,1569,"Shinjuku can be a bit distant from many of the sights and the subway is-at first blush- a bit overwhelming. We stayed for four nights and enjoyed our time. The shuttle to Shinjuku station is timely and valuable. Use it. We upgraded to the Executive Level and got access to the breakfasts and happy hours and it was very good money spent. The lounge can get crowded but it is well worth it. The pool is a very small lap pool with rather rigid rules like much of Tokyo. The staff here was excellent during lounge hours, and special requests like late check out. Thank you, Hilton. Recommended for tourist families like ours.",4,2015/06/17
1,REDACTED,en,1570,"First, let me say that many people do not consider this property because of its location, Do not be put off by the location as it's easy to get to. There are two subway lines that are directly under the hotel. They also have a shuttle that runs every 20 minutes to the area of Shinjuku Station. You can actually walk it in about 12 minutes. It is near the Metropolitan Government Building where you can a free view from the top floor and there are many restaurants in the area,
The lobby, as others have mentioned is very big and there are a lot of flight crews that come and go but I do t go to a hotel to sit in the lobby so that did not bother me. The restaurant for the morning buffets breakfast is off the lobby and busy but we never had to wait more then a minute for a table.
The executive lounge is very big and does have space for everyone, For breakfast they have fresh squeezed orange juice that was unlimited and delicious. Very nice offerings for both breakfast and evening were offered in the lounge. The staff were wonderful and always smiling. I'd like to recognize Maya for her help with questions we had. She also went above and beyond in getting my iPad charger and cord back to me after I checked out.
The rooms were large, the bathrooms and all the amenities you would expect and we had lovely views over a small park where cherry blossoms were still in view. 
I would not hesitate to stay in this hotel if you want to be in the Shinjuku district.",5,2015/06/17
1,REDACTED,en,1571,"We couldn't be happier with our choice of hotel for our stay in Tokyo. 

The location is perfect. Very central. Shinjuku station, with its many metro and train lines, is just a short walk away. Or you can take the Maranouchi line that actually has a stop right under the hotel, so you can literally walk right from the reception. As it's situated in the lower, middle part of Shinjuku, we were able to reach a lot of places by foot. We even walked to Shibuya and Harajuku from the hotel. 

The staff was very friendly, there were some some great restaurants in the building and the hotel has a nice, modern feel. It didn't hurt that our room was upgraded either. 31st floor had a great view. Will probably stay There again next time!

Our only gripe was that such a great, 38 storey hotel doesn't have a rooftop bar.",5,2015/06/17

1,REDACTED,en,1580,"An urgent business trip took me to Tokyo over a weekend in early May, and back to this classical Tokyo hotel. 

The hotel is well located in one of Tokyo's trendiest districts, Shinjuku. If you are able to find the free hotel shuttle bus from Shinjuku station, it's a very quick 5 minutes ride to the hotel. Otherwise a cab ride from the station is just as fast. 

Having last visited in 2008 I noted that the hotel's interior has improved through renovations. The rooms are comfortable with hip vintage looking furniture, newly produced. Shoji screens on the windows and tactile wallpapers and finishes in the rooms interior convey typical Japanese design touches. The bathrooms are a bit on the smaller side, but this is typical of Japanese hotels.

I used the gym and it is adequate for a one and half hour cardio and strength training workout. There is a small indoor pool adjacent if you prepare to swim laps. 

The breakfast in the main lobby has excellent choices and should be included as part of your reservation plan.

1,REDACTED,en,1582,"I spent 6 nights in this hotel. The hotel is typically a chain hotel. My overall rating will be between 3 and 4. The hotel is not far from the Shinjuku station. There is an airport shuttle bus (called Airport Limousine) from the Narita airport to the hotel (final station after Shinjuku), cost 3’100 ¥ one way Tickets are available at the airport counter and at the hotel. (Can be added to the hotel bill, one way approximatively a bit more than 1 hour.)
The hotel itself was clean, room compared with Hilton standard on the small side, but OK, Queen size bed Ok, ice machine on the floor, air conditioning, TV which I did not use.
There is free Wi-fi in the room but also in the hotel lobby. There is a faster Wi-fi available, but some cost will appear.
There are a few restaurants nearby and a Starbucks. (Alternative for a quick breakfast)",3,2015/06/15
1,REDACTED,en,1583,"I had a very nice stay at this hotel while in Tokyo on business. I gave it 3 stars because although I have no complaints, I can't say that I was especially impressed. The hotel has a relatively generic feel, which is not surprising given it is a chain hotel, though I don't think it has to be that way. I think it makes a huge difference when you walk into a hotel and feel like the lobby is a bit more of an oasis that has a real sense of place (in this case, Tokyo, Japan, etc.). As for what I liked about the hotel: It is in a good, really accessible (2 subway lines) location (allowed me to do a lot of sightseeing during my spare time), the rooms were clean, modern and comfortable, the service was good (Concierge desk was always busy, but they did a good job in not making me wait too long and being helpful), and the food was very good. I especially enjoyed the sushi restaurant and breakfasts in the executive lounge (a nice large buffet spread).

The gym is a bit small as is the pool but at least they have a gym and a pool... the hotel is not too far from the Shinjuku train station which is not a walk to be done with luggage but is a walk to be done at night when looking to hang out and find good restaurants or pubs.",4,2015/06/14
1,REDACTED,en,1586,"History: Originally built and opened in 1984. Superbly well maintained and renovated. 
Location: Near Shinjuku Ward government buildings in relatively quiet part of Shinjuku. Still convenient for business, restaurant, recreation and other Tokyo centric activities.
Interior Decor: Well maintained and inviting atmospheric lobby/lounge with 21st centuryt look. Guest room I stayed features Hilton standard furnitures for Junior Suite rank. Extra large and stylish sofabed and tables. If I have to be picky on the minus point, the work desk (though glass is clean and well maintained) is a bit small to work with.
Exterior Apperance: One of the distinguished hotels/skyscrapers (38 story high) in Shinjuku area. Competes with other superior deluxe first class hotels in the area such as Park Hyatt Tokyo, Hyatt Regency Tokyo and Keio Plaza.
Outside view from the room I stayed at (2509): Sophisticated metropolitan view of Shinjuku building clusters to west (as I luckily got upgraded to a junior king suite room). 
Room Size: (Upgraded from regular queen to junior king suite, with the privilege of Hilton HHonors Gold status) Approximately, 44 square meters. Seems larger than what the number appears. 
Room Cleanness: Very well maintained. Spotlessly clean.
Bathroom/Shower booth: Very well maintained. Spotlessly clean. Ultra modern appearance with water temperature that can be controlled in increments. 
Noise Insulation: Very good.
Price and Value: Incredibly reasonable price, considering the condition of the room, upgrade value (for Hilton HHonors Gold) and the magnificent view from the room. OK, so, it was on Monday night, so the price setting was much lower than, say, Friday night or Saturday night.
Bed: King size. Firm softness. Slept fine.
Others: 2 bottles of complimentary mineral water as Hilton HHonors Gold member. The front desk staff was very friendly for providing such complimentary upgrade from Standard Queen to Junior King Suite. 
Breakfast buffet (complimentary forHiltonHHonors Hold): 37th floor executive lounge. Local and global food selections. Super friendly staffs. That orange juice squeezing machine is very unique though it's not particularly an efficient use of orange as fruit (skins, extra pulps). Luxurious settings with most customers dressed more than business casual level.
Overall: Very professionally trained caring staffs.",5,2015/06/14

The staff was always incredibly helpful and kind. Breakfast was great, they had both the Japanese choice or the Western choice. Shinjuku is a trendy neighborhood, but it's not close to most of the cities attractions. You will need to take the subway almost everywhere, or you can rent bikes too! There's a subway station right below the hotel and another line two blocks away. It's definitely worth the price.",5,2015/06/10

It could be ramped up easily with better / fancier / more extensive food throughout the day. The view in the lounge is pretty good at sunset. The breakfast in the main restaurant again can be ramped up with some tender loving care. It is pretty good, but could be exceptional! 

Since it was a special occasion, the hotel upgraded us into a HUGE room. We really appreciated it! Beautiful room!!!! Thanks Hilton! 

Pretty good location, but ~ 6 blocks from the Shinjuku station (a major train station). This is a fun area to walk around.

The room size is normal, bathroom is tiny and hated the glass enclosure (just a third of the tub) so every time you shower, water splash out.

Ordered champagne and chocolate prior to arrival...never delivered. Front desk just said..I am so sorry. Period. No offer to try to deliver it again etc. (I was going to give them 11k yen for it but at this point..I am just over it since I am not going to beg to any someone)

Internet was slow..tech support was arrogant as I was running into VPN issue...I was almost hoping they just transfer me from the Japanese tech spurt to India call center where I got better service. Surprise surprise and no, not exaggerating. 

The location was convenient though..close to shinjuku but far enough so not too noisy.

I probably would not stay here next time ...it was about 50 bucks per night cheaper than Marriott and about 80 bucks below Hyatt...I probably will just spend more and try something else. (Room service staff were really nice though. )

1,REDACTED,en,1594,"The location is very close to the Shinjuku station. It would take about 5-6 minutes of walking but they also have a very punctual shuttle that operates every 20 minutes. There are great department stores in Shinjuku alone so, you don't have to take trains, metro..etc. There is a Starbucks 1 minute away from the hotel, but be prepared to stand out as a tourist since this area is mostly offices and therefore almost everybody is in business attire. :) 

The rooms; I stayed at Twin and Kind deluxe rooms for a total of 6 days. I had to extend my stay and they unfortunately made me switch rooms. I understand the reservations and booking situation, but it is a huge hotel and I was disappointed to pack and then wait for the other room to be ready hence wasting my time as a tourist. After reading and hearing about the small size of bathrooms in Japan, I did find the bathrooms in good size. The tub is pretty big and bathroom is decent size. 

However, both of the rooms I stayed had stains on the carpet and had significant wear and tear on the furniture as well as on the chairs. 


I wish there was a way for them to ""track down"" the smokers as the hallway smelled of smoke for days. So, nobody does anything for smoking violators. This is Hilton after all, so it must be up par with international standards. 

I highly recommend not including the breakfast. I would not know about the ""executive breakfast"" upstairs, but the breakfast at the lobby level was not to my satisfaction. They had eggs, teeny tiny sliced swiss cheese(the only cheese), yogurt, melon, watermelon, apples and some fishy items. There is not enough variety to warrant the cost of breakfast in my opinion. 

While majority of the services was great, some of the employees seemed just too fake.",3,2015/06/08

The bigger room was still old and had a funny noise all the time.

What was worse....was the concierge! They gave us wrong information about the local tour that we booked thru them and we ended up missing it!

Location of this hotel is for business since it is close to a lot of office buildings. but for shopping and sight-seeing i would not recommend. they have a free shuttle service to and from the Shinjuku station every 20 mins but still this is such a hassle especially when you are with kids and it is raining. worse part is, when we booked the Airport Limousine, we were told it was full and we should instead book through Hyatt (next door) or hike up to Shinjuku station. we were scheduled to depart the hotel at 5AM. the concierge simply didn't care that we had kids with us and said they can NOT do anything. we asked them to book at the Hyatt on our behalf and they said we should go across the street and book ourselves. Not being happy with the decision, i called for the Night Manager and he was able to sort this out. they gave us a spot on the Airport Limousine the next day.

1,REDACTED,en,1605,"I chose this hotel because there was a sale going on and the Hilton was relatively cheaper than other five star hotels. My brother was arriving earlier than I and I wanted to make sure he could check in before I arrived. I sent the front desk an email explaining the situation and asked them to let my brother check in early on his own. When my brother arrived, the front desk person at first refused to let him check in because his name was not on the reservation. Then they said no room was available for him until 6pm, even though other passengers arriving at the same time he did were allowed to check in right away. After much going back and forth and misunderstanding, we finally managed to check in. But that was only after I arrived. When I walked into the room, I was disappointed. While there was nothing wrong as such about the room, it looked considerably more worn out than what they appear in the photos they have online. Otherwise, the hotel is adequate. The decor of the room was slightly dated, but it was otherwise adequate. The location is good. It is within a two minute walk from the Nishi-Shinjuku station. My room was quiet enough. I did not hear any noise. My one other complaint was about the gym. I went for a run at 1030pm, when the gym staff had left. But the gym was supposed to be open 24 hours. There was no AC in the gym. I called the front desk four times and nothing was done about it. By the end of my room I had trouble breathing. All in all, I think the quality of the staff leaves much to be desired.",4,2015/06/02

1,REDACTED,en,1607,"This was my first trip to Asia. I had been many times to Oceania, including Tahiti, Fiji, Australia, and New Zealand, so I thought I knew what to expect in Tokyo, but I was wrong. We had a late flight from Honolulu, where my Mom's luggage was lost and there was an incredibly long process to complete the lost luggage form, but the ANA representative was extremely thorough and professional and told us exactly when her luggage was scheduled to arrive. I booked a Blacklane Limo from Tokyo Haneada to the Tokyo Hilton since our flight was already late and our baggage problem further increased our arrival later to the evening. My expectation was that a Lincoln town car would turn up and drive us to the Hilton. Oh boy, was I wrong. A Maybach Mercedes arrived with a white gloved driver to escort us to the Hilton. He carried our luggage to the check in desk and refused a tip. This was unbelievable customer service, the likes of which is very rare in our good old USA.

The Hilton was wonderful. It was clean, polished, glitzy, and comfortable. The check in staff was multi-lingual and polished. Check in was a breeze and we were off to the room sans Mom's luggage. The room was sparkling clean. It had fast Wi-Fi. The shower was interesting. It was more like a broom closet that sprayed on the floor, but was adequate with nice pressure and hot water. The toilet was nearly identical to mine at home with an automated sprayer, washer, and dryer. Apparently, they have an elegant high tea here. We were never able to obtain a reservation, but the week we were there, it was strawberry week, and every possible preparation of strawberry was served.

We had an executive level room which included morning breakfast, mid-day refreshments, and evening cocktails with appetizers. Anyone who has been to Tokyo can appreciate what a value this is, for what little we paid. 

This hotel provides 5 star service for what would cost at least 3 times more for the same level of service. We loved it! Subway was in lower level of hotel. There was a free shuttle to shopping/food halls which was very high end/designer.

1,REDACTED,en,1614,"We arrived jet-lagged and exhausted at the Hilton Shinjuki but though we were hours ahead of the check-in time, the friendly staff made sure we had a room - and an upgraded one too. That pretty much sums up the staff of the hotel - they're friendly, professional, welcoming and an example of what hotel employees around the world should be. Wherever we went in the building, we were greeted by smiles and offers of help. But like all chains, the hotel felt a bit clinical and corporate - lacking charm and individuality.

Our room was on the 28th floor with views out to the east of Shinjuku. The hotel itself is on the western side of the district, surrounded by towers representing government and commerce. In this area, bars, restaurants and shops are largely found either underground or at the top of the buildings. The eastern side of Shinjuku, famous for its wild and colourful nightlife as well as the rail station, is about 10 minutes walk away. There are several metro line stations within a few minutes walk of the hotel and you'll need them to get around this giant city.

Our room was clean, of a good size and with good air con and facilities. Maid service was excellent. The bathroom was on the small side and awkwardly designed but had a great shower.

Breakfast was in the Marble Lounge on the ground floor - a barn of a space that lacked atmosphere and itself merged into reception. The quality of the buffet was good with a mix of local and Western offerings. As a loyalty programme member, we were able to have breakfast on the 2nd floor restaurant but it was more chaotic and the re-stocking of food wasn't good.

There's an English-style pub on the ground floor but we didn't really like it - partly because it seemed a lot smokier - and preferred the bar on the stylish 2nd floor. This floor also had three restaurants - all of them very expensive. We tried the Metropolitan Grill on the first night but ate out the rest of the time, finding food of equal quality but a lot cheaper.

We stayed four nights and that was about long enough in Tokyo for us.",5,2015/05/30
1,REDACTED,en,1615,"We would definitely stay here again. Great Hilton. Lovely staff. Great breakfast. Great district to stay in.
Beware how busy it can be- allow at least half an hour for check out if you have to hurry for a flight etc.
Also suggest ask for a room away from the lifts.
We were a little taken aback by all the taxes on the final bill even after pre- paying- we should have realised this at the time of booking- that there are quite a few little taxes in Tokyo.
We did try to have a game of tennis when we had a spare 30mins but the cost of using the court and hiring rackets and balls was another surprise- I'm thinking space in Tokyo is so limited all costs must be recouped!
Appreciated the free browsing internet in room.",5,2015/05/29
1,REDACTED,en,1616,"My husband and I stayed here for the first 7 nights of our 31-day trip to Japan--and were extremely pleased!

LOCATION: Although it's not in the center of the city (or bustling with nightlife, like Ginza), it was perfect for us because (1) the basement level has a tunnel to the satellite station (NishiShinjuku) of the largest (busiest) train station in the world, Shinjuku (which is alternately just a 13-minute walk directly from the hotel and the center of lots of activity, such as famous department stores and museums)--and our purpose was touring the many widespread attractions of Tokyo and surrounding areas; (2) the hotel is in a business district, so the streets and sidewalks are not over-crowded and nearly empty at night, and very quiet; (3) a peaceful park is right across the street--as are other conveniences, as noted in other review; (4) the views from the higher floors are spectacular; (5) plenty of temporary parking right in front for our private guide for touring outside the city.

ACCOMMODATIONS: As Hilton Gold, we were fortunately and graciously upgraded to a very spacious two-room suite on the 17th floor, affording access to our choice of either the Executive Lounge or the Gold Lounge for huge breakfast buffet and ample evening hors d'oeuvres and desserts. (My husband had breakfast each morning, and we visited the lounges several evenings. However, I am total vegan, and there wasn't a lot for me. The staff always graciously provided my husband with a box of soy milk and a banana for me to enjoy in our suite with the vegan items I'd brought from home.) Loved the beautiful yukata plus lovely bathrobe, the multi-function toilet, the shower ROOM with deep soaking tub, and the Japanese decor, including sliding screens, along with modern desk and seating.

STAFF: We experienced genuine graciousness and efficient expertise throughout: from the porters to the receptionists to the concierges & servers at the private lounges to the restaurant staff. (We dined only one night--in their Japanese restaurant, which is one of several options--to entertain guests, as none of the restaurants could do full vegan meals, but the staff went out of their way to provide items that did work for me, and my husband and our guests found the food outstanding and beautifully presented.) The bell desk staff also took excellent care of having our luggage forwarded to our Osaka hotel (a totally different chain), for which we could put the charges on our bill--and our luggage was in our room at our Osaka hotel when we arrived the next day via bullet train.

TIP FOR VEGANS: You can get a good enough breakfast at the Executive Lounge or Gold Lounge--and there's a charming little Indian restaurant in the basement-level shopping arcade.

We plan to return to Japan and this hotel will be our first choice! Arigatou to all at the Hilton Tokyo!",5,2015/05/29
1,REDACTED,en,1617,"This was my first business trip to Tokyo and first time at Hilton Tokyo in Shinjuku area. It was easy hotel bus ride from the airport to the hotel which cost 3200 yen. Check in started a little rocky because they insisted that they could not upgrade me to an executive floor. After getting the hotel manager, who help resolved the issue and was able to find the last executive room. The room was great as expected. But, what I love about the Hilton Tokyo was Maya Kohhara, manager at the executive lounge and her staff. Maya's smile and her passion for what she did was contagious and made all the guess feel so welcome and happy. Since this was my first time, she has one of her staff make some personal recommendation on where to go for site seeing. Maya and her team made my business trip well worth staying at Hilton Tokyo. Thank you and will be back again in July.",5,2015/05/29
1,REDACTED,en,1618,Just coming to the end of a one week trip to Tokyo staying at the Hilton in Shinjinku. We stayed on the club floor and had access to the executive lounge. The service was outstanding and the hotel staff are amazing and couldn't do enough for us. As executive lounges go it is reasonably well catered for. The rooms were a little small but this is Tokyo! However they were clean and comfortable. the hotel breakfast was of a good standard. It is in a good location for shopping and access to the Metro for sightseeing in the rest of the city. I would recommend.,4,2015/05/28
1,REDACTED,en,1619,"Just the kind of business stay I like. Nice rooms, good gym and spa, and a breakfast buffet with good healthy options.
All you need to be comfortable between business days. The area has several restaurants when you first learn how to find them in the tall buildings. Quiet expensive dining.",5,2015/05/28
1,REDACTED,en,1620,"We stayed at the Hilton Tokyo for 4 nights and got the most amazing price using a Japan travel info website. 

Our room was a twin, the beds were very comfortable, as everywhere in Japan, all amenities provided, including lovely cotton yakata for bed time. The view from our room was great, we were on the 32nd floor. Bathroom is nice and contains everything that you need.

The breakfast is expensive, but worth it, a big buffet with Western and Japanese food, juices, pastries, everything you would want!

The service at this hotel is fantastic, the concierge give you great thorough directions and really great recommendations, all of the staff are very accommodating and efficient. 

We did not use the pool or gym facility, we were too busy exploring Tokyo but I heard that they are really nice. 

The only feedback I have is that the station Shinjuku is HUGE - like an underground labyrinth and it is impossible to get the correct exit for the hotel, we spent HOURS underground. The signage in the station is not good and the Hilton staff helped us as best they could but it really was impossible to come out at the right exit. Also at moments, the wifi wasn't great, but we forgive them as the rest of the service was so good. 

Loved staying here, location is great! Would definitely come back for another stay.",5,2015/05/28
1,REDACTED,en,1621,"The multi-million dollar renovation is really worthy when the hotel looks totally brand new inside. The premise locates in west Shinjuku that is pretty quiet but the nearest mall is within 10 min walking distance. Hotel provides free shuttle to Shinjuku shopping area every 20-min. View from the room is generally blocked by the surrounding high rise and the rooms on higher floors give better view. Buffet breakfast at Marble lounge is pretty good and has much wider selections than the executive lounge. Room size is ok for 1-person but a bit crowded for 2-person. Some cable TV channels are available but not enough for an international brand. Service is acceptable but the staff at concierge are just too cold in service attitude. 

APPRECIATIONS
1. Brand new renovation with some Japanese touches
2. Generally good command of English by majority staff
3. Convenient store, ATM machines and pathway to underground are at the basement
4. Bathroom amenities are great & smell nice (from Peter Thomas Roth)

DISAPPOINTMENTS
1. Proactively asked irrelevant questions before understanding my needs (I just wanted to leave a bag at concierge but the bell boy asked me several questions that are irrelevant to my needs, e.g. when was my flight, have I booked airport shuttle ticket, how many person I am travelling with, and etc) - should ask right question & listen to customer needs
2. Breakfast options at executive lounge is very limited. I was not greeted by any staff inside the lounge but just did everything by myself. I don't even know if there is any menu for ordering omelette
3. Inconsistent information at the front-desk. When I check-in, I was told that internet is free. But when I check out, I was told that internet was not covered.
4. Banana cake & 3 drinks were put in executive room but there was no sign on whether they are complimentary or just for decoration.
5. Pool size is too small",4,2015/05/28
1,REDACTED,en,1622,"I traveled with my wife for a 5 day vacation to this hotel and was upgraded to Hilton king jr suite. the worker was great here but there were quite a few down sides.

1. the maintenance of this location is horrible. (given that we go to this hotel because we were told this place has been renovated) damage is everywhere, the sofa in the room got rips and tears that i was embarrassed to have my family member visit me at the hotel, so i end up going to them instead. and that goes the same with lobby sofa, most of the leather/pleather sofa's got tears and rips, that it was not fixed. granted it was a busy hotel, wear and tear is to be expected, but to me it was unacceptable appearance.

2. this is really not a complain but the bed is firm! back breaking firm, my wife and I barely got any sleep because the bed is so hard, it feels like sleeping on hard floor, i ended up sleeping on the long sofa because it was softer, the staff was nice enough to add a pad every time we complained but it just gets really lumpy after 3 pads,we had asked to change room, but was informed that every room as the same bed. so if you like soft bed, this is not a place for you. 

3. the Hilton Gold membership gets us wifi, but this wifi is slooooooow. if you want better wifi you would need to upgrade. in USA standard this wifi is like slower than my 4g signal on my cellphone. 

4. there IS bus from the hotel to train station, however it's always full!!! so we ended up using taxi it's 730 yen from hotel to JR station

over all it was a nice place if you really don't care about resting and just want to enjoy the great Japan, again i like to stress that the SERVICE people was great! For us however, we were tired, beat everyday with no good rest, and was not able to keep our original plan for my family visit the vacation was pretty much ruined. so if you're looking for a nicer place, good appearance and soft bed, you might want to go to another hotel.",2,2015/05/28
1,REDACTED,en,1623,"The location of this hotel was very convenient to where we wanted to travel during the 2 days we spent in Tokyo. It was an extra bonus to have a free shuttle that could take us to and from the main Shinjuku train station. The concierge was able to give us great recommendations to nearby restaurants and were helpful with directions on our train stop questions. Our room was very large and clean. We booked a Twin Tower Executive Suite but upgraded when we checked in to a King Jr. Executive suite. This room was much larger than our friend's regular room. It was nice to be able to utilize the executive lounge on the 37th floor where we could eat a simple buffet breakfast. We did not take advantage of the other amenities the lounge offered but they were numerous, including check out services to avoid the crowd downstairs. The staff was generally friendly. I had the best manhattans in the bar on the 4th floor and our lunch in the Japanese restaurant Tepanyakki section at the hotel was delicious. Just a short walk away, we found a wonderful Karaoke place and had a blast making fools of ourselves. We would definitely stay here again.",4,2015/05/27

The lounge is well staffed and has an excellent selection of food for breakfast, including traditional Japanese dishes and western dishes. It's always fun to use the fresh squeezed orange juice machine (watching the oranges go in and get squeezed). Breakfast downstairs has a much larger selection of food as well.

1,REDACTED,en,1628,"I used Hilton Tokyo on around new year festival 2014-2015.

The location is near Shinjuku, you can walk or take subway only 1 station.
If you want somewhere quite in center of Tokyo, I recommend here. but If you want to enjoy shopping, eating and night life, it's quite far from the entertainment area, check the map before choosing.

The service quite good, except staff's language skill, like other hotel in Japan but poorer than Cheap hostel around.

I reserved Airport Limousine since checking in and the staff is really nice at that time.
However, our flight is early and I didn't want to panic, so the night before checking out, I went to reception counter asking about payment and ticket of Limousine bus we'd reserved in Japanese 「すみませんが、明日の朝にエアポートバスを予約しましたが、お支払いの事を伺いたいんですが・・・」（Excuse me, we've reserved a Limousine bus on tomorrow morning, so I want to ask about the payment....)　and the staff said to me 「問題ありません。全部はもうすみました」which is mean 'No problem, everything was done' so I thought they will included in the bill when we check-out, but it's not.

On the morning when we're waiting for Limousine Bus, 2-3 staffs help us checking baggage but no one can speak English, they ask us in Japanese 「日本語わかる方いらっしゃいますか？」Which is mean 'Do you have someone who understand Japanese here?' Oh!? I have no problem with speaking Japanese but it I don't think this is what Hilton staff should ask their foreigner customers.

The real problem happened when the bus come and ask us for 'ticket' but, of course, we didn't have that so we have to go to reception counter, where I'd gone their the night before and where the staff had said to me 'everything was done' while many people on the bus had to wait for us buying ticket.",3,2015/05/26
1,REDACTED,en,1629,"As per managements suggestion from my 2013 review, I booked the newer king exec room. it was perfect!

I took the complimentary breakfast at the restaurant on the main floor. It's a fantastic buffet that has something for everyone. Avoid 8-9am for crowds. Hotel is attached to great shopping and the food in the hotel on the second level was top quality. Junisoh is upscale awesome sushi and the sushi chefs are friendly and welcoming. You can walk to the streets of Ginza but it is a healthy walk. Free shuttle to Shinjuku Station.if you love walks/jogs there is a great park across the street.

Still 1 of my favorite hotel in Tokyo!

The room is pretty big compared to other Tokyo hotel and they keep their room very clean and up to date, unlike Hyatt opposite it that I stayed recently, which was very dated.

The bathtub is big with shower area and the room has enough space for a couch and study desk with 2 executive chairs!

Every 20mins the shuttle bus pick up from hotel to Shinjuku station and returns.
Airport buses stopped directly in front of it!
What more convenience can you ask for?

Price may be a bit steep but if you are on company expense or has need for space then you should look into this hotel.

Won't be last time for me for sure!",4,2015/05/26

We enjoyed all the accommodations we stayed in, but this was the ""cherry on top""! We do travel a fair amount internationally, and I would have to say our room at the Hilton Tokyo was probably the most beautifully designed and appointed we have yet encountered. We came to expect excellent service in Japan, and this was no exception. I'm not sure who he was, but it seemed we were shown to our room by the hotel manager. I wanted to show my wife Shinjuku, but between the room and the executive level lounge (I kind of slurged on the room), we just stayed in the hotel and treated ourselves to excellent evening meal and drinks, and a great breakfast, both included with the room. The staff was very helpful arranging further travel.",5,2015/05/26

The food at breakfast was lovely, lots of choice at the buffet to fill you up for a day of exploring. We chose to eat at the restaurant on our first night due to how late we arrived, we ended up sharing a pizza and has a coke each due to how pricey everything was. Equivalent of £6 for a can of coke... DAYLIGHT ROBBERY.

1,REDACTED,en,1634,"Hilton Tokyo is situated right next to Shinjuku - allegedly the World's busiest railway station with easy connections to everywhere in and around Tokyo. You can easily walk to Harajuku, Shibuya and beyond through the Yoyogi Park. 

The hotel itself is nicely appointed - we stayed in an executive suite which had a grand view and everything you could need from a hotel room in a metropolis. The Executive Lounge has a really quite decent layout in the evenings with hot and cold appetisers and a good selection of free drinks. The lounge was quiet and had wonderful views over the city in the setting sun. 

The breakfast was ok - with the omelette station as the best feature. 

We recommend Hilton to anyone who wants to stay centrally with some creature comforts for a decent price!",4,2015/05/26
1,REDACTED,en,1635,"We stayed in a 'King Junior Suite' which was on the 34th floor and was huge with 2 big windows. No complaints about the room generally. They offered us an upgrade to the executive floor (36/37) for $100 a night, but that didn't seem worth it.

This hotel does everything it's supposed to do - it's relatively central (although definitely not in a cool neighborhood as it's on the quiet west side of Shinjuku which has a CBD vibe), it has all the facilities you'd expect, but it is a little dated and there's no real wow factor. It's a solid 4 star. When we travelled, however, it was also quite good value. So the message is - make sure you pay 4 star rates. 

A couple of minor quibbles (none of them major):

* The breakfast was pretty average - you can tell most things are frozen - but it did have an omelette station and very nice baguettes (made by their in-house French patisserie). But I'm very food focussed so for most people it would be totally fine. It gets very busy, especially between 8 and 9 as there are a lot of business travelers.

* This hotel is BIG and BUSY. The lift ride from the 34th down to the lobby almost drove me crazy as it would stop on average about 5 or 6 times on the way down.

* Gym and pool are average.

* There is not much immediately around the hotel - but there are two subway stations 10 minutes walk away. 

* The hotel floors smell of smoke.

These were all not major issues, but just be aware that the experience just generally lacks the wow factor that might make it 5 star. This is partially because the hotel is just too big to offer that next level of service. 

On a more positive note - we ate at the Metropolitan Grill on a couple of nights, and the staff there is ridiculously nice. Everyone chatted to us, and the chef actually came out and talked to us for 20 minutes on the second night. Really nice people. Can highly recommend. Food was good too (although not cheap).",4,2015/05/25

The hotel was in a fairly good location, not too far from shopping attractions etc, though the subway station was a bit of a walk when you have all your luggage. The room was clean and modern with a splendid view of the city. We initially had some difficulty getting the room we booked despite giving plenty of notice, in the end to get the King bed (which is more like a queen size in the western classification) we were eventually upgraded. The gym and pool are quite good, just brief yourself on Japanese hyper-cleanliness etiquette before hand to avoid embarrassment! We had one breakfast at the hotel which was good, no poached eggs at the egg station but they are more than happy to have some made in the kitchen. We didn't try anything else as we had a long list of establisments to visit. The concierges were very helpful printing maps etc but unfortunately could not narrow down the exact locations of several restaurants. While I realise there are thousands of restaurants in Tokyo, not so many have three Michelin stars. Leaving for Osaka was very easy as the hotel arranged to have our baggage sent down ahead of us so we could take the bullet train with only our day bags. I would definitely consider returning.",4,2015/05/20
1,REDACTED,en,1644,"Booked a room for 4 - why is a room for 4 normally so difficult to obtain?
Costly, but we think worth it.
Superb views from 36 th floor. 
The room style was slightly Japanese - we loved it.
We had two pop up beds for the kids which were fine.
Room pretty much immaculate!
Lovely fresh clean linen and towels. Good toiletries provided.
Bathroom small, but very well appointed. The toilet was a modern Japanese one with the bidet function. Also the mirror had a heated centre which didn't fog up, and was necessary with 4 showers in the morning and not a lot of ventilation.
Air conditioning was useful, and very quiet.
The toiletries and extras that are provided daily are very good quality and should provide you with everything you might need in that area.
There is a TV and DVD player, but tourist don't really get the chance, other than a quick laugh at some Japanase TV antics.
The lighting in the room is well though out and will accommodate a number of scenarios.
Free bottled water every day again a nice touch.
Beds were comfortable, even the pop ups.
Shower over the bath was ok, maybe missing a little pressure or different setting as a luxury.
Tea and coffee facilities were great - the little pod coffee machine made pretty good coffee.
Check in and out we're easy, and all staff encountered were friendly, polite and helpful.
Most spoke a little English, which was greatly appreciated.
The concierges were real winners, with excellent knowledge and suggestions for things to do, places to shop and eat.
The free shuttle to Shinjuku Station was a great, easy way to start the day.
I'd love to stay here again...
If you stay, sign up with HHonour for additional benefits.
Only negative for us was the rigmarole to have a swim. It's only a small laned pool, but I love having a swim at the hotel after a long day's adventure. It may just be a cultural thing, but you had to wear a cap in the pool, had to shower before you went in,band it seemed like them didn't really want to to enjoy a swim in their hotel.

We suite we had was fantastic, 2 big TVs, lovely bathroom and I can't fault it. 

The breakfast in the lobby was great and had the best variety of food I've had in any hotel! The egg bar where the cook omelettes etc was my favourite. 
My only negative when it comes to the hotel was the executive lounge... I have been to much better lounges in the Hilton portfolio and if you don't already get it through being a Hilton diamond member then I'd say it's maybe not worth having the executive rooms just for the lounge. 

The hotel is in a great location, easy walking distance to Shinjuku station but the hotel run a shuttle service to and from the station throughout the day.

1,REDACTED,en,1648,"The Stay at the Tokyo Hilton was the very last night of our 4 week holiday. We were not after ""bell and Whistles"" but a comfortable and relaxing stay, to refresh before our long trip home. We got that, even though the dining was a little on expensive side.",4,2015/05/17
1,REDACTED,en,1649,"I decided to stay in this hotel because I really liked it the first time I was there. Rooms are clean, have great views and amazing bathrooms. If you have the chance to go to the 37 floor from 6p-8pm they serve snacks and drinks.
Service is good and fast. You can take the airport limousine in the hotel and also some free buses to Shinkjuku station. Also concierge are very nice and can give you recommendations on where to go or what to do.
I will definitely will stay there in my next visit to Tokyo.",5,2015/05/17

Make sure to check out the shops in the Hiltopia downstairs! Very convenient! I was able to store my luggage when I left for Kyoto for a few days and got it back exactly the way I left it. Conveniently located to subway stations. The room amenities were great! I was a little disappointed that the wifi is not free in the rooms, but was able to use it easily in the lobby.

The staff was very accommodating on check in and i didn't have to lift a finger. As a Hilton Gold member I was given a great room, very huge and very well appointed. There was a free shuttle from the hotel to the general Shinjuku center and the airport shuttle stopped right at the hotel. Great WiFi service

1,REDACTED,en,1654,"We chose between Shinjuku and Ginza area – and zeroed in on Hilton Shinjuku. 

What we looked for : Stay within walking distance of the station. hotel that was listed on airport drop off by Friendly Airport Limousine, Hotel that was listed by tour operators as a pick up point on a early start of a tour day, hotels that were central enough to give you things to see, Free wi fi access in the room and elsewhere, buffet breakfast, comfort and service . We found it all . 

It was a truly amazing experience. Confirmations and special requests co -ordinated , instantly and well , way before the trip. 

Comfortable, elegant rooms, warm and very helpful concierge who always go beyond the call of hospitality, suggestions on Sushi meals , re confirming the show tickets and more. Smiling faces, great hospitality.

1,REDACTED,en,1655,"I highly recommend the Hilton Tokyo. My husband and I spent a total of 5 nights there in April 2015 and were thoroughly impressed. The room was spacious and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. The bed was comfortable and the linens were of high quality. Our room had a spectacular view of the city. We also enjoyed the breakfast buffet served in the first floor restaurant each morning. The hotel has a great central location which made it easy for pick up by local touring companies for our scheduled tours. It was also close to the subway station. There was free wifi in the hotel lobby. The Assistant Front Office Manager Mr. Fan was outstanding and went out of his way to accommodate our request for a King size bed (my husband is 6'6"") when the hotel was at capacity and none was available. The bathroom in the Junior Suite was fabulous with a soaking tub and of course the wonderful Japanese heated toilet seats and bidet. With a a Junior Suite you also have access to the VIP Executive Lounge which includes a free cocktail hour, snacks and free wifi.",5,2015/05/08
1,REDACTED,en,1656,"We stayed at The Hilton for a week. On arrival it was clear that the hotel was incredibly busy and there were lots of people hanging around the lobby. We later found out that while it was true that the hotel was busy there is not free internet in the rooms and so many people would hang around the lobby using the internet. People would sit on the wooden partition to the restaurant so while people were trying to have a meal or a quiet drink they would have others sitting quite literally next to them on the phone!

We were given a room on 27th floor and one evening we noticed a cockroach on the mirror. We called down and they sent a really sweet young man up with bug spray and chocolates!!!! As we all know, if we see one cockroach there are many more around. We made it clear that we were not happy to stay in the same room and rather than upgrade us they gave us a room lower down on 18th floor! So we packed up and moved. The following day I called to complain to a duty manager only to be informed that there was a room on a higher floor. So we packed all our things yet again and naively thought that they would at the very least give us a better room or access to the lounge. Nope! Exactly the same room on a higher floor. We were truly disgusted by such lack of service and disregard to the inconvenience of it all. We really thought that the Hilton would do better but were truly let down.

Breakfast had a good selection but staff taking the empty dishes away were very slow as was delivery of the hot beverages.

The lobby was often very cluttered with luggage because rather than move luggage to a room behind the scenes it would be left there piled up!",2,2015/05/07
1,REDACTED,en,1657,"This was a family trip to Tokyo, we booked 3 rooms altogether and they were lovely. The rooms could be a little more spacious but that's me just being picky! The view out of the hotel window on the 35th floor was incredible both morning and at night time.
Staff were incredibly helpful and courteous. The free wifi on the lobby level was great too just to catch up on emails or keep in touch with loved ones.
A short walk from the main area of Shinjuku and plenty to see and do on the way, underground malls etc

Also if you don't like the walk you can get the subway from just a few minutes from your doorstep into Shinjuku station and onwards.

1,REDACTED,en,1661,Choose this hotel because good reviews but was rather disappointed-rooms fairly outdated - carpet not very clean and small bathroom with no separate shower in deluxe room.

1,REDACTED,en,1662,"We stayed at Hilton Tokyo for 4 nights in late March with our 2 boys (3 years old and 1 years old). We have connecting King Deluxe/Twin Deluxe Rooms (rooms 1827/1828) - rooms were a good size (bigger than expected), recently renovated and the arrangement was perfect for us. We did not have Executive Lounge access which was a bit disappointed as HH Gold (I felt we were perhaps penalized as we needed connecting rooms).

Good location for exploring Tokyo (near to rail stations, many places walkable). Took the Airport Limo bus direct from Narita Airport - very easy. Also easy to get taxis from outside.

We used the hotel babysitting service on 2 nights (a 3rd party company) and whilst incredibly expensive (US$215.00 for 3 hours) the company seemed very professional so would recommend them. Only issue on the first night was that, despite telling Concierge in advance not to call our room when the babysitter arrived (as the kids would be asleep), sure enough they phoned up and woke the kids up!

Quality and variety of food at the breakfast in the main lobby was great. Service not so good - two out of the three mornings they tried to usher us into an overflow area (smoky bar area), I think because we had kids, as there was space in the main area which I pointed out.

One evening (between 5PM and 6PM) we tried to order some food for the kids in the main lobby restaurant, but were told this was not possible as between 5PM and 6PM they need to clean the tables - seems a bit silly (particularly as round the clock food is advertised in that restaurant), kids were starving so we had to leave the hotel and go elsewhere as we did not want room service. 

All in all a nice hotel, perfect for business travellers, couples, people with older kids we just felt that travelling with young kids some of the staff werent particularly welcoming. (Contrast Hilton Osaka where we stayed a few days later - see separate review, where no problems at all from that perspective)",4,2015/05/04

I was checked-in via mobile app during arrive at the hotel i standing in the line that show HHnonors member!!! then some guy in the front office come to told me that this line for member only, then i said yes i have a member card and already checked-in.

During find the room check-in guy try to find my room but it take 45 mins for that!!! Because they said room was full (They said my room was smoking room even i ask for non-smoking) we are waiting for 45 mint for check-in after traveling 6 hours!!! even supervisor come to help but make a little bit face and voice for me (Even i paid money)

Finally i got the room but they said one room first because one it not availible yet wait a bit 20 min!!! they will give a key we go to the room and change then go eating take a bout 5 hours and back hotel but nothing happen and even a word for us. then i decide to go to ask them about one room we waiting. And wait 10 min for check and got the key.

The room have a pair of socks and underwear in the toilet on top of a shower glass!!! i written the note for them to manage that (also waiting for apologise word but wasn't)

I have a gold member that i will get free drink 2 per day but i have to ask for that on second day!!!

I have been travel lot and stay in Hilton a lot too Hilton Tokyo is the WORST one if compare with all hilton i stay Hilton Bangkok Germany Italy was the one in my top 3.

I try to impress my family with Hilton but they didn't like them.

But if we talking about Hotel facility its OK the room quite small for 2 and one kids for one is OK.

I really would like to share this and hope Hilton Tokyo will change their services to make Hilton standard. Oh, i also missing my point from them too i have asked but they said they are international hotel it will take long time for point but now almost a month still not come yet but Hilton Bangkok, Hilton Germany and Hilton Colombo was in my account already even stay after tokyo!!!

1,REDACTED,en,1665,"The location was terrific, because you have a shuttle to the train station every 20 minutes. From Shinjuku station you can get anywhere! I heard there is also a subway station very nearby the hotel, but we did not avail of it. We only had two short days, so hopped the train and subways to try and cover as much as Tokyo as we could, so we did not take advantage of being in Shinjuku. Right near the hotel you have the Metropolitan government building with a free observation deck (I heard it is nice) and there are some interesting areas surrounding the train station (red light district - we didn't have time to see it). We stayed in an executive room. It was marvelous. The perfect place to come back to after a long day of sightseeing. The view from the lounge was of the entire urban area. We took our breakfast in the lobby buffet, which was very diverse and clean. You can eat at the lounge but it has less options (but also less hectic). They offer soft drinks all day and delicious appetizers and quite a bit of alcohol for happy hour. I understand they have also have afternoon tea. Lounge also has free wi-fi. To Narita we ended up taking the shuttle bus not the Narita express, because Shinjuku station is huge and we didn't want to lug our suitcases around. Here the bus picks you up at the hotel, it is much more convenient.",5,2015/05/04

The room was pretty small, but otherwise nice. Breakfast has a big variety. Also, the metro is connected to the hotel although a bit of a walk. Internet is not included in the room rate which is quiet disappointing as most hotels have it. Generally satisfied, although there is room for improvement.",4,2015/05/03
1,REDACTED,en,1668,"I went to great lengths to research accommodation options in Tokyo that would be accessible for wheelchair users. I phoned and emailed in January about request for disabled access room. I have stayed at Hilton hotels before and was confident from the email confirmation that an wheelchair accessible room was available for our stay. On arrival on 28 th April we were advised the room I had confirmed was not available and had been given to other guests. Initially we were not given an apology or other options until we then had to log onto Wi-Fi to show email that we had in fact had written confirmation. I was travelling with family from Australia and this really was upsetting. I have never had a hotel confirm in writing that an disabled access room will be provided and then it is not provided. Unfortunately this overshadowed our stay and the subsequent attempts made by staff ( once we insisted that no in fact I can't walk, use a bath over a shower etc) to make up for this major issue, ie provision of shower chair etc. I did raise this issue with the front desk, however on check out my husband was not asked about our stay. I am happy to be contacted by management to discuss further as Im not confident that I could book with hilton hotels again. I'm sorry to be so negative but the initial response by the check in counter that its a busy time of year as the reason for the room not being available was appalling.",2,2015/05/03
1,REDACTED,en,1669,"Being built all the way back for the 1964 Olympics, this Hilton hotel is still looking really sharp. Main area's, hallways and elevators look like the have just been redone. The standard rooms could do with an upgrade though; especially the bathroom (however well-maintained) was a bit outdated, and the furniture shows a few years of experience through scuffmarks. The traditional Japanese yukata's in the room instead of standard bath robes are a nice touch.

For me, this stay was a special occasion since it was my birthday! My girlfriend arranged a sweet in-room breakfast to which the Hilton did not only add complimentary mimosa's, but also two nice pairs of chopsticks and a beautiful love story giving special meaning to them. Besides al this, they gave us a larger version of their standard room on a high floor looking out over the Shinjuku district sky scrapers. Thanks, Hilton Tokyo!!

The hotel is a short 10 minute walk from the big Shinjuku JR station but you can also take the M subway line even quicker from Nishisjinjuku via the underground tunnel from the hotel to the station.

I think the Hilton is a very good choice for a stay in Tokyo and I would surely consider staying here again. High-end hotels in Tokyo tend to be freakishly expensive and Hilton Tokyo finds a great balance between service, location and rates.

If you are visiting, make sure to check out the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building for a nice (and free!) 360 degree city view.",5,2015/05/02
1,REDACTED,en,1670,"Hilton Tokyo is nicely located in Shinjuku. It's close to lots of skyscrapers, especially the Tokyo Metropolitan Government buildings which is just up the road.

The hotel is modern and is bustling and efficient.

Room on the 29th floor is large and clean. The bed was comfortable and has a good view of the Shinjuku city.

The executive lounge was ample and a great place to grab a bite before venturing out exploring Tokyo.

It's a popular hotel for several airline crews.

The breakfast buffet is extensive and have both Japanese and Western cuisine. Love the hot chocolate here where they include a marshmallow in the drink. Very nice.

There is a shuttle to Shinjuku station but those who are familiar with Tokyo's subway and metro rail system would be quicker to catch it from Tochomae station to get around rather than go all the way to Shinjuku station. You can get to the station using the underpass just outside the hotel.

Quite enjoyed my stay here and will definitely be back.",4,2015/05/02

The sushi restaurant is simply amazing & the service impeccable!
My only negative comment is the fact that the lobby is always overcrowded with noisy groups or people sitting there taking advantage of the free wifi. 
The hotel should provide free wifi in all rooms so that you don't have to fight your way to the lifts and bars/restaurants. 
Overall a very good , clean and central hotel.",4,2015/05/01
1,REDACTED,en,1672,This hotel is next door to the Hyatt Regency which we also stayed at. The upgrade to a suite (paid for) was well worth it. The views from the room over the city were fantastic and it was very clean. The upgrade included breakfast in the top floor lounge which was a lovely selection of Japanese and Western food where the views were of the whole city. Courtesy bus to Shinjuko Station was handy and we used the hotel bus to travel to the airport which was really easy and cost-effective. Lobby service not quite as good as the Hyatt Regency but was still efficient and helpful. Would recommend this hotel as a place to stay in Tokyo.,5,2015/04/30
1,REDACTED,en,1673,"We stayed in a junior executive suite which was sitiuated on 15th floor with fabulous views of the Shinjuku areas skyscrapers and office buildings. 
Being in an executive room this gave us access to the executive lounge on 37th floor. Here breakfast, afternoon tea and canapes and drinks were served between 6pm and 8pm. Breakfast had a fantastic selection of both traditional japanese food as well as cereals toast and cooked foods such as scrambled eggs and bacon. If not in an executive room breakfast is served in the lobby area where I think there was an even bigger selection of food.
Every member of staff was polite , helpful and very friendly and greeted you with a lovely smile. 
There is a fitness studio and pool which looked great although we didn't get a chance to use them
There is a Hilton shuttle bus which runs regularly between the hotel and Shinjuku station although it is within a 10 minute walk if you prefer TheAirport Limousine bus picks you up at the hotel which takes you to Narita airport and costs 3100 yen per person.
Below the hotel there is a small complex of shops and restaurants called Hiltopia and there is also access to 2 different metro stations giving you great access to the rest of the city.
Beds and pillows were very comfortable and the rooms have sliding window shutters which are excellent at blocking out the light. Plenty of storage space and a sofa and huge TV. Bathroom was very modern with a walk in shower and bath.
As Hilton gold card member wifi was free although if not you have to pay. Nowadays I think wifi should be free for everyone.
We didn't eat in any of the hotel restaurants although there was a good selection which looked lovely. As in most hotels of this calibre food and drink were expensive.
Overall a fabulous hotel and can't praise it highly enough.",5,2015/04/29

We traveled within Japan following the stop in Tokyo and the bell staff was very helpful in storing some of our luggage until our return to Tokyo. This made our traveling by train much more convenient.",5,2015/04/28
1,REDACTED,en,1676,"My feelings of this hotel were mixed, some of which were due to cultural differences (see below). 

The service was excellent, the breakfast buffet delicious (both Western and Japanese options were great), the room clean and spacious, the gym had lots to offer.

The lifts were slow at peak times but the hotel was full to capacity when I was there.

My one major complaint was that they allow smoking in the bar. While I understand that this is acceptable in Japan the hotel chain is an international brand which should have better standards. The bar was adjacent to the breakfast area and is used as an overflow for diners. I was not prepared to eat in an area that still smelled terribly of smoke from the night before (stale!!!) so I had to wait for a suitable table in the main area. The hosts were not that happy about me taking a table for 2 rather than sitting at the bar but the smell really was off putting.

The wifi in the lobby dropped out often and was a bit slow and there are fairly hefty charges for in room internet.
The beds were very firm which was great and the room was extremely quiet.

The location was great for my needs.",5,2015/04/28

Breakfast line was big and serve with good ingredient. Of course, lot's of tourist but many staff with fast service, and great service mine.
Our group need to travel to Osaka , so we deposit all luggage in the hotel 4 night before check inn. The hotel staff escort us every process even we do not check in yet.
Hotel's location is little bit far for walk to Shinjuku but they have shuttle bus to serve us every 30 minute with free of charge. and lower floor of hotel is connect to subway station.
No another place perfect than this hotel in Shinjuku for my opinion. Everytime back to Tokyo must be this hotel . Very impressive. Nothing to complain.
If you have little bit more budget for hotel when you visit tokyo, must try this hotel.",5,2015/04/27
1,REDACTED,en,1678,"We stayed for our last night in Tokyo. I have to say that proximity wise I would prefer the Ginza or Shibuya, as Shinjuku station is a hike with bags in tow. When you do get out though the area is peaceful and lovely. 

The lobby area is lovely and well appointed. The concierge was helpful in making reservations for dinner at the Hyatt. Reception was prompt and accommodating with our bags for the last day.

The rooms are a reasonable size with comfortable furnishings. We had an Executive King including desk. I think the price matched the accommodation, however it does look like the hotel may require a face lift in the near future as the carpets and furnishings are starting to date. 

On the whole it is great hotel that I would stay at again.",4,2015/04/27

Can't wait to come back for 10 days next year!!,5,2015/04/27
1,REDACTED,en,1680,"We stayed at the Hilton Tokyo for 3 nights in April 2015. It was our first time to Tokyo and we wanted to stay in the Shinjuku area.

We caught the friendly limo bus service from Haneda and arrived at around 9am. We couldn't check-in as it was too early and were asked to come back as late as possible to make it easier for them. I didn't know that the advertised check-in time in Japan is stuck to - they will not allow you to check in early so this is something to bear in mind if you are on a early arrival flight. Our bags were taken from us as soon as we entered the lobby and were put in our room ready for us when we did check in later on that day. Check-in was easy and the reception and lobby staff were very friendly.

The room we had was on a high floor and was lovely. It was a great size for a Japanese room and the bathroom was a good size as well. Everything was so clean and there are plenty of toiletries provided in case you need anything. The bed was so comfortable and very big - the bedding was great quality and we had 3 wonderful nights of sleep after long days of sightseeing. There is also plenty of room for storing bigger suitcases and clothes if you are there on a longer trip which was handy so you were not tripping over things like you can in smaller Japanese hotels. The shower was quite powerful and plenty of towels were provided each day. 

The wi-fi is not free at this hotel but there is a free business centre with plenty of Mac's which you can use just off from the lobby. It also has a little seating and table area which can be handy to use when you first arrive as the lobby is always busy with little seating available.

The hotel does offer a free shuttle bus to Shinjuku station which we did catch on our first day there but it was full each time we saw it depart so we just used to walk the 10 minutes there instead of waiting for it. There is also 2 metro/subway stations which you can walk to using the underground walkthrough the hotel has, it took us around 5 - 8 minutes to walk too.

There is a shopping mall attached to the hotel called Hiltopia which has a couple of small supermarkets in there which are useful for picking up drinks and snacks for the room. There were also a few nice looking restaurants and bars in the hotel but unfortunately we never got the chance to try them as we were always out in Tokyo and preferred to eat in the city.

Overall we had a fantastic stay and will definitely stay here again when we visit Tokyo again in the near future.",5,2015/04/27
1,REDACTED,en,1681,"This is a lovely property, but the service I experienced here was nowhere near what I would expect from a Hilton. It was, for some reason, shabby.
My room wasn't serviced during my two day stay. I don't know why - but certainly no one at the hotel took any action about it.
The real let down was, however, service in the bar. Even with four staff, and a manager, it took us twenty minutes standing at the bar before we were even allowed to order (there were less than a dozen guests in the place) and a further twenty minutes to get drinks - except, of course, they had forgot my beer entirely.
Terrible, terrible service Hilton: I have to come back to you in a few days - please improve.",2,2015/04/26
1,REDACTED,en,1682,"I’m sure many of the travelers to this hotel are business travelers, but without a doubt having spent a good amount of time in the lobby, there’s also a sizeable portion of folks there for sight-seeing. With this taken into consideration, I was surprised at how unhelpful the concierge was in helping us out. Take, for example, their helping with our trip to check out Sumo practice. They had no connections with any tour companies that could assure a spot at a stable from which to watch the practice. They did, however, have a map they assured us we could use to find our own and sit in on practices. So we dutifully showed up in the neighborhood a few days later, map in hand, eager to see things. Turns out the map is completely outdated. Over an hour of frenetic searching and help from local Japanese, who also couldn’t understand the poorly labeled map, we gave up. Wasted a precious morning.

What's strange is that such sub-standard concierge assistance could persist. I’m sure these guys get requests for tourist help all the time. Perhaps most than any country I’ve ever been to, it would in principle be *very* helpful to have a skilled concierge that could help you navigate the confusing local Japanese system. Yet these guys can’t help you book train tickets, make tour bookings, or buy a local SIM like I could from a comparably nice hotel in, say, Hong Kong. I don’t know what the deal is, but one of the big reasons I stayed at this hotel was to get help from the concierge and net-net, it was actually a counterproductive experience.",2,2015/04/26

The staff -- from the check-in agent to the bellman to the concierge -- were incredibly friendly and helpful and went out of their way to accommodate us and make us feel welcome. (Why can't it be more like this in USA?!?). The room was quite large, especially by Japanese standards (although the sink area was a bit cramped). The fitness center was stocked with great machines. The breakfast was extraordinary; everything you could imagine was available and it all tasted great. I really liked the convenience of the hotel, connected underground to a subway stop, and a free shuttle bus to the closest JR train station. On my next trip to Tokyo, I absolutely am returning.",5,2015/04/25
1,REDACTED,en,1684,"Let's do it fairly, the price is not cheap at all, but the room, is just usual, furniture far from being impressive, the window, you can just open half of it.... In my vie, it is a massive hotel with no personal touch, there are too many people at the lobby, waiting long to get their service and the worst one is, internet in the room is not free (even cheap hotels in Japan can provide it for free. The good thing is staff is nice, although not really that nice but mechanic (been to other hotel in Japan where the staff is excellently nice... Hilton might need to seriously think of improvement, service and infrastructure....",2,2015/04/25
1,REDACTED,en,1685,"Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku is located just 10 min walk from Shinjuku station, hotel has a free shuttle service that start working at 8:00 am.
I got a executive Junior suite at fl 38, giving excellent view over the area, breakfast was a bit boring but still good and as always I comment about food it will depend on your own preference but you will find a eggs station, asian and western food.
AS typically in JApan, service is excellent, people do the real effort to do their job the right way.
Only precaution is that not to much people understand English, then if you don't speak Japanese, be prepared with your printed phrases or as work for you.
I mentioned about the shuttle service starting at 8:00 am for you to be careful that if you need to go to Narita Airport around 10:00 am, you will need to take a taxi(~ 800 Yen)
My wife and kids use the indoor pool and they said it was really nice and temperature was perfect.
As usual, Hilton did not disappoint me. It was a bit crowded for check in but I use the Hilton Honors line which is always short.",5,2015/04/25
1,REDACTED,en,1686,"We are a family of 3 adults plus two toddlers. Stayed for 4 nights ( first 2 nights in King executive room n last 2 nights in King city view executive room ) our preferred choice is actually the King city view room which is much bigger n comes with a separate living area. However, as the hotel is fully booked during our stay, thus the reason why we need to book two different category of room. Service was excellent from the moment u step out of the airport limousine bus ( yes it stop directly infront of the hotel entrance ) the bellboy was already on standby to help with our luggages.. Executive rooms check in was supposed to be on the 37th floor but nothing was mentioned in the email confirmation. Anyway, the lady at the front. Desk was very helpful too. While waiting to be check in, my elder boy fell and knocked his head against the floor..without us requesting, the lady who is attending to us quickly went and took an ice bag for my boy. This is what we call service and goin g the extra mile for your guest! As we stayed on both 37th n 38th floor respectively, views was spectacular. Both rooms were clean and simple, nothing fanciful..breakfast at executive lounge was ok with limited selections ( we choose to ate at the main restaurant instead with more variety ) they also serve pre dinner canapés n drinks which is a bonus if you are back at hotel early. Go for the executive room if you can afford it. Location wise, I wouldn't give it a five stars even though there is actually a subway linked to the hotel ( is a pretty long walk to the station and it can be tiring walking to and fro esp after a long day out ) there do provide hotel shuttle to shin juku area but do note the last bus back to hotel is at 2140.. If you missed it, the cab fare from shin juku is around 730 yen.",4,2015/04/25
1,REDACTED,en,1687,"Stayed for a week, and loved every minute of it - although who has time to stay at the hotel when in Tokyo? Centrally located close to Shinjuku station (about a ten minute walk, although the hotel has a shuttle if needed) and with a subway station available through a 400 meter long underground tunnel, the hotel is accessible in several ways - including direct bus service from Narita (Friendly Airport Limousine). 

The breakfast was impressive and the hotel staff really made the whole experience something to remember. We'll be back next time we're in Tokyo, and I have no problem recommending this hotel to anyone travelling to Tokyo!",5,2015/04/24
1,REDACTED,en,1688,"Everyone is so polite and wants to help ! Amazing ! 
The hotel is cool, clean , always full , nice and well located but like all Tokyo , not everyone speaks English so is complicated.
Also in the breakfast we got the impression that the lady always wanted to sit us kinda far because we are younger and maybe not dressed as chic as most ( sportswear ) .",4,2015/04/24

Spectacular views in a newly renovated room
All furnishings & fittings are 5 star quality & bed was excellent
Varied eating options with very high quality food but all expensive 
Breakfast can be a bit chaotic on busy mornings
Have to pay for room wifi",5,2015/04/23
1,REDACTED,en,1690,"Long term favourite hotel of mine for business trips to Tokyo. Especially the newly designed Executive rooms are outstanding. And the staff is absolutely excellent and always very friendly.
This time stayed in a Deluxe category room, which is not as modern as the Exec rooms but still very well appointed and comfortable. Good size with ample opportunity also to work on the large glass workdesk.
I do however have one observation that slightly reduces my opinion about this hotel. There appear to be more and more large tourist groups which make the hotel loose some of its appeal. Not only because of the crowded feel in the lobby and at breakfast, but also because of the behaviour of some of these groups.
(Maybe Hilton has acquired Nikko Tokyo in the Odaiba area to have that become more of a tourist offering and allow the Hilton in Shinjuku to again became a primary business location.)
The tourists groups may also be the reason behind the impression that the breakfast in main restaurant (Lobby) seems to have less variety / class, and the breakfast offering in the Exec Lounge has been upgraded.",4,2015/04/23
1,REDACTED,en,1691,"We choose this hotel because the room are newly renovated and plus the room are quiet large compared with normal hotels in japan. The breakfast was brilliant and all the staff are very service mind and are ready to help you out , some of the ammentities we request at odd hours , they were able to provide us in 5- 10 minutes time. We really loved the place and would definitely return. Even though the hotel is a bit of walking distance to JR SHINJUKU STATION, but that is not a problem , they have a shuttle service every 15 minutes to the station. The only cons would be there is NO free wifi in the room.",5,2015/04/21
1,REDACTED,en,1692,"I've stayed at The Hilton Tokyo in Shinjuku twice during the past two weeks. The first time was for three nights immediately after arriving at Narita. A Limousine bus takes you directly from the airport (where you buy your ticket) right to the front door. Couldn't be easier! This is a modern hotel with excellent professional staff who manage to keep things moving swiftly and with ease no matter how crowded it appears to be. My room was on the 38th floor with fantastic views of the city. It had everything one would expect from a hotel of this caliber (a wonderfully comfortable bed & pillows, good linens, nice bathroom products) but also some much appreciated extra touches such as a coffee machine, sleepwear, slippers and a makeup mirror in the bathroom. However, there are a couple of things I think they could improve upon, one being the lighting. I found it very dim. And the other would be the wifi. It dropped out constantly AND they charge you for it's use when you are using it from your room! I think this is unreasonable in a world class hotel - and the fact that it didn't work well at that. They did deduct one 24 hour period from my bill when it barely worked at all, but still, this really isn't good enough. I didn't have breakfast there but there is a wonderful chocolate/pastry shop in the lobby where one can buy a nice croissant or muffin to have with your coffee. There is a free shuttle bus which runs between the hotel and Shinjuku Station regularly and from there one can take advantage of Tokyo's fabulous (and cheap) public transport system. I returned to the Hilton Tokyo for one last night before flying out. Although my room was the same price as my previous visit, I was a little surprised to find it was significantly smaller (not a huge problem) and that it didn't have a window! Since I was only there for one night I didn't complain, but I would advise anybody booking to insist upon a room with a window - and hopefully a great view.",4,2015/04/21
1,REDACTED,en,1693,"For the past four years, my wife & I have celebrated our anniversary in Japan. Thus, this time we stayed at the Hilton Tokyo to celebrate our anniversary. Encountered some problems at check-in and checkout but I think the root of the problem was the Hilton USA reservation system and not the hotel.

From the moment you walk into the hotel, I knew we chose the right hotel. The smell, décor and hotel staff smiles said it all. Stayed in the Executive King and this was just what we were looking for more space, more comfort, and much bigger than those typical hotels in Japan. As a Hilton Honors Gold member, we had access to the regular Honors lounge, the exclusive Gold & Diamond Honors lounge as well as free breakfast at the wonderful buffet. We do not drink alcohol but in the evening wines and spirits were complimentary. The hors d'oeuvres were great! 

I have read other reviews stating the hotel was old, hotel staffs were rude, or it was inconvenient to the JR station. I saw none of this. I feel the Hilton Tokyo was nicer than any Hilton I stayed at. The staffs were not only just professional & polite; they were very sincere in wanting to help make your stay a great experience. The hotel offered a bus shuttle to/from the JR station every 20 minutes and the airport limo stopped right at the hotel.

During our stay, Mr. Tamura, Guest Relations Manager could be seen everywhere in the hotel greeting us and other guests and making sure that everyone was enjoying their stay. I could go on & on how wonderful our stay was or elaborate about the fruits and champagne apology gift but I won’t. 

Instead, I will mention one thing that made our hotel stay experience go from wonderful to AWESOME. As mentioned, I had a problem at checkout. The hotel could have done nothing AFTER I checked out since after all, I may never return to the hotel again. To my surprise, I received an email from the Director of Operations, Mr. Cook who asked how my stay was and informed me the problem I had at checkout was corrected and that I would be receiving a refund.

All I can say, Hilton Tokyo in Shinjuku is the hotel we will be staying at in all future trips to Tokyo!!!",5,2015/04/21
1,REDACTED,en,1694,The hotel was perfectly located. Free shuttle bus to Shinjuku Station and access to two subway lines within a few minutes walk from the hotel.

1,REDACTED,en,1695,"We stayed at the Hilton for 4 nights in March 2015 in a twin deluxe. The hotel was beautiful and service was outstanding. Very western – rooms where a good size and offered amazing views of the city. The hotel is a little out of the ‘hub’ of Shinjuku however the hotel offers a shuttle bus every 20 mins to the main train station. If you’re arriving from Shinjuku I would either jump on this or grab a taxi (roughly $10 AUD) rather than walking – we got a bit lost and had to drag our suitcases up and down stairs. 

The only downfall is that this hotel doesn't offer free Wi-Fi in your room, having travelled between a few hotels it seemed the ‘norm’ for Japan so that was a bit disappointing.

All in all a very good stay and I would have no hesitations going back.",5,2015/04/19

1,REDACTED,en,1697,"I highly recommend the Tokyo Hilton. It is in an excellent location and a very nice facility. I stayed in a junior suite, which was extremely spacious. The bathroom was a bit small but that is to be expected in Tokyo. Included in my room was access to the top floor executive lounge, where there was a free happy hour, breakfast and afternoon tea. I could also eat at the lobby buffet, which was $30 per person so I think the executive rooms are a great value.

The concierge service was outstanding. Since this was my first visit to Tokyo, I used them daily. They went out of their way to be accommodating and went above and beyond each time I used them.

Metro lines are connected directly to the hotel and the airport limousine bus stops directly at the hotel. 

Overall, it was an excellent experience and I would certainly stay there again. I found a 72 hour sale on Expedia so my room was 1/2 the normal price. If you ever get the opportunity - go!",5,2015/04/18

1,REDACTED,en,1704,"I have never had a good experience with Hilton Hotels in the past but the Hilton Tokyo changed that. The service was excellent from start to finish.

We stayed one night on a Sunday and then checked out until the Thursday when we stayed for a further 3 nights. They kept our large bags there during this time for free which allowed is to travel around Japan for a few days with just smaller bags.

The location is excellent; just a short walk from Shinjuku main station, or if you are really lazy like us Nishi-Shinjuku or Tochomae metro stations are less than 2 minutes walk away. The transport system in Tokyo is brilliant and once you have accustomed yourself to it nowhere is hard to get to. Get yourself a Pasmo or Suica card as they are accepted on most of the public transport in Tokyo as well as Kyoto and Osaka. I'm sure they are accepted elsewhere too but these are the only places we went to.

I would highly recommend this hotel if you are visiting Tokyo.",5,2015/04/15
1,REDACTED,en,1705,"Hilton has always been the international for me when traveling abroad (even though throughout this trip we were not in Hilton all the time) We were recommended to stay in this hotel and it was surely not disappointed with the hotel.

Getting there was a bit difficult especially travelling from Shinjuku station. Nevertheless, we got to the shuttle bus in Shinjuku (after taking us about 30 minutes finding it). Always find the West Entrance and Keio department mall.

We got the 2 Jr Suites for 3 nights and it was simple great. The newly renovated rooms were so modern yet it integrated the Japanese style Ryokan room. I couldn't ask for more to end my stay in Japan.

Out of the 2 Jr Suites, one room was upgraded to a bigger room was literally so big that you could easily sleep another 4 people in it in the living area. I have to say thank you for the Hilton for this upgrade. It was great to entertain guest and serve Nespresso coffee. 

The toilet in my opinion was a bit small but I guess that was the design of the hotel. The Shower/Tub had a powerful shower though the angle of the shower a bit off as I prefer the shower to rain. Nevertheless, It had pressure which is most important.

The executive lounge upstairs was good for cocktail time and breakfast. With its freshly squeezed orange juice to their hot food, everything was good. Of course, it was busy upstairs and the staff was trying their best to manage/clean as much as they could.

Not sure whether the hotel provided a turn down service in the evening but it surely would enhance the experience of guest.

Service in general was good. The hotel was busy so I guess they couldn't address everyone accordingly. Concierge was always busy but helped me in booking other restaurants around the area and also the Limo Bus to the airport.

Free wifi was given which was a super plus point.

If you were to ask me to stay back in Japan, definitely a yes. The value of it is definitely good for its brand and service.",5,2015/04/15
1,REDACTED,en,1706,"As promised we returned for another visit, and the service in both the cafe and executive lounge was fantastic.

This Hilton had a sign on the front desk that read "" If things are not right we will try to make it better"" and they definitely lived up to that sign. Thanks to Ms Takahashi and manager Mr. Shimamune a problem at check-in was quickly resolved - again THANK YOU.

If you miss the shuttle to the station its only a 10 minute walk from the hotel. In other words, a great location, wonderful staff.

The only negative - the wifi is not very good or reliable.",5,2015/04/15
1,REDACTED,en,1707,"We were here in 2010, after we checked out from Disneyland, we checked into this hotel, the staffs were super friendly and helpful. Location was good, can easily get taxi too from here. Room was big and clean, as you would expect at any Hilton hotels..",5,2015/04/14
1,REDACTED,en,1708,"We spent a week at this Hilton, which is well situated a short walk from the main Shinjuku JR station. The hotel provides a complimentary shuttle to the station, but the walk is short and mostly undercover.

All the staff we dealt with were extremely pleasant, efficient and helpful - particularly the reception staff (who provided a complimentary upgrade) and the concierge staff (who assisted with arranging transfers to onward accommodation and reservations at local top-end restaurants).

Our 33rd floor Executive King City Suite was furnished in a modern Japanese style and had brilliant views of the city. The room was very quiet and could be made very dark (important for those recovering from jet lag).

The hotel has an indoor pool and, as far as hotels go, an excellent gym with a variety of cardio equipment as well as a free weight bench, medicine balls and weight machines. 

I would definitely recommend upgrading to a room with ""Executive"" benefits as this gives you access to the Executive Lounge, meaning you can drop by whenever during the day for complimentary drinks (soft, tea/coffee, alcoholic) and snacks (mostly fruit), as well as afternoon tea and evening drinks. 

Breakfast is offered in the lounge as well, although the hotel also allows you to opt to take your ""Executive"" breakfast in the ground-floor restaurant/bar, which is recommended because you then have access to the full breakfast buffet. The buffet is plentiful, offering the usual large-hotel breakfast fare, with staff on hand to make espresso-based drinks and egg-based breakfast items (omlets etc).

I chose this hotel based on its location (close to Shinjuku) and because I picked up a good rate in a Hilton promotion. I would stay again and would gladly recommend it to friends.

The hotel appears to be a favourite of airline crews and tour groups - so if you are looking for a quiet or boutique hotel experience, the Hilton Tokyo probably isn't for you. Otherwise it is difficult to fault the hotel (and I wouldn't fault the staff at all).",5,2015/04/13

1,REDACTED,en,1713,"From start to finish, this was a truly great experience.

We had booked a junior suite but was upgraded on arrival (due to HHG) to an executive junior suite. The check in process was a bit lengthy (there's always much stamping of documents in Japan) but overall great. Our room wasn't ready on arrival so our bags were taken cared of (and later delivered to our room).

The room was large and had a great view of Tokyo from the 31st floor. It had both a bathtub and a large shower. They provided amenities included everything we needed. 

The executive lounge is on the 37th floor and has staff as great as everywhere else in this hotel. Food, snacks and drinks are above average for hilton lounges. There's a separate lounge which seems to be open only to HH Golds and HH Diamonds on nights when the normal lounge is unusually crowded. The food and service in this lounge is even better than at the normal lounge.

We had breakfast both in the Exec Lounge and in the Marble Lounge (the primary breakfast restaurant next to the lobby). Both were good, but the Marble Lounge is of course better being the primary breakfast restaurant. They serve a very good buffet of western and Japanese breakfast items. There's an egg station for omelettes and fried eggs. 

The concierge helped us book restaurants, karaoke sessions and train tickets. They couldn't actually book the train tickets, but they filled out a booking form which can be presented to the JR ticket office (which often does not speak much english). For our Shinkansen ride to Kyoto, the concierge wrote something in Japanese in a section I think was ""Other"" on the form. Upon asking what she wrote, she said that she had asked them to give us seats on the Mt Fuji side of the train. Amazing level of service!

All in all, one of my better hotel experiences. Hilton is not a luxury hotel, so don't expect white glove service. But I've never felt so at home in a hotel, ever.",5,2015/04/08
1,REDACTED,en,1714,"We've been staying here on trips to Tokyo for about the last 10 years and are always happy with the experience. Service is stellar. English is spoken by everybody we encounter (and spoken exceptionally well by the concierge and front desk staff).

Two adults and one kid fit perfectly into a King Executive suite, and nicely into a King Jr. Suite. In the past we've had both kids with us and did fine in a King Executive. Roll-away beds, though, for the kids... The Executive Lounge was handy for take out drinks.

Normally we never eat hotel breakfasts because we'd rather go out, but in this case we really like the buffet. It has both Japanese and ""Euro"" food. The dinner buffet was fine when we were exhausted from walking all over Tokyo and didn't want to go out. There was plenty of sushi and non Japanese stuff to eat. It was about $160 for 2 adults and a kid. 

The one downside to the hotel is that it needs some physical rehab in places...The furniture in the restaurant is surprisingly stained, and our rooms were looking worn out in places. We needed more outlets, too. 

Location and service easily make up for any wear and tear issues, though, and we'd go back without hesitation.",4,2015/04/08

Buffet Breakfast was good. Formal Restaurants were expensive. Service was par excellence. Free shuttle bus to Shinjuku Metro station and return. We booked and prepaid months in advance on a no refund basis at a fantastic room rate. Shinjuku park had the cherry blossums in full flower. Metro at first a little daunting but we soon got the know how it works and used it most days (Efficient, clean & very cheap). Wi Fi in room and in lobby etc included.",5,2015/04/06
1,REDACTED,en,1717,"It's actually been almost a year since I stayed at this hotel but as I'm about to book another stay here I discovered my absence mindedness and decided to explain why this hotel is one am headed back to once again.

My wife and I travel to various location around the world about once a year, sometimes twice. We are leisure travelers who don't mind paying for good service and luxury although we like deals as much as the next person and will try to strike the right balance between cost and benefits. 

We were originally booked into the Peninsula hotel and were going all out for a luxury experience with Rolls Royce transfer from Narita and the whole nine yards, but as the vacation drew closer we had some money constraints so wanted to cut back on the splurge to some extent. I had seen this hotel from previous research and decided it was good enough given the cost was only about a third.

I booked a king jr suite as for whatever reason it was coming up cheaper than a regular king room (bonus) and I chose the non-guaranteed upgrade to executive (space permitting) and when checking in was given the upgrade. The cost for booking in this fashion was quite a bit less than booking executive directly.

Ride to the hotel from Narita was done on the busses that proliferate at the airport. Ride was long and interesting but the seats were soooo tiny. Japanese bus seats were just not made for our North American fat butts! 

Anyway, jet lagged and tired, we had a smooth check-in and went straight to our room to pass out. Room was bigger than we really needed, in fact we never used the couch area at all. Like I said, we only booked the jr suite because it was cheaper for some odd reason. The view was basically of another building. Bed was fine. Bathroom was nice and had the funky wash-your-butt-for-you technology which was fun.

We woke stupidly early the next morning and decided to wander the area. We strolled down to Kabukicho which is where lots of the things we wanted to see were located (robot show, cat café, etc..). It was a short 15-20 walk and we easily found the places we were looking for although they were still closed at that hour. Found a Starbucks in the Shinjinku station and had fun watching the trains go by with workers faces smushed up against the glass as they were packed in like sardines. 

We headed back to the hotel for breakfast (included with the executive upgrade) and thoroughly enjoyed the buffet. It had enough of a variety that I had no complaints. Service for coffee and such seemed prompt. 

We managed at other times during our stay to utilize the club lounge that came with the executive upgrade and that was a pleasant surprise. While it appeared you could self-serve yourself, there were also wait staff who took drink requests and brought them to you. The view was very nice from there and selection of drinks was more than adequate for our tastes. They had nice snacks as well at times.

They had a shuttle to the train station but we just walked to/from as it really wasn't that far.

Perhaps the best thing I can say about the hotel happened near the end of our stay. My wife and I had purchased some jewelry while on a tour the previous day in Asakusa (other side of town) at a store that only spoke japanese. We discovered that the jewelry would not be allowed back into our country (Canada) as it was on a prohibited list so we wanted to return it. We explained our dilemma to the concierge and she contacted the store, explained the situation and arranged for us to return the item. She gave the taxi driver instructions on where exactly we needed to go and upon getting to the store the clerk had our refund money ready for us in an envelope which he handed over after examining the item being returned. It was a costly mistake for us as the taxi was expensive but it was far less than the cost of the jewelry and we absolutely could not have pulled off the return of it without the considerable help of the concierge.

Sadly the time we wasted on returning the jewelry ate up our last day of sightseeing before we had to scoot off to our cruise ship in Yokohama.

I loved Japan so much, I've been itching to go back and we have finally decided to return next year. I wanted to find a nice hotel that was a bit closer to the other areas we haven't seen yet so we could avoid using the trains as they are a bit daunting (at least Shinjuku station was) but after much research I find myself being drawn back to this hotel despite its location being less than ideal for us. Simply the value is just too great. Most of the nice hotels I can find where I'd feel comfortable are very expensive (like $600-$800 a night) whereas this hotel is about half that.

When I was there, our friends who were cruising with us stayed at the Shangri'la Hotel (one of those $800/night places) and we went there to meet them one night for supper and I could say that I could tell it was classier for sure. The staff bowed deeper and the service was a notch above too. My friend left her MS medicine on the bus from the airport and she appealed to the concierge there for help. They called the company, located the bag and had it held for pickup, then one of the hotel staff ACCOMPANIED my friend in the taxi to ensure everything went smoothly. That is wow service, and certainly above and beyond what I would reasonably expect any hotel to do. On the other hand this hotel (Hilton) provided adequate and helpful service for my own crisis and I paid $800 less than my friend for the same 2 nights.

My upcoming stay will be 3 nights. I could stay at a ""wow, whiz bang service"" place walking distance to the attractions I want to see for $2400 or this ""pretty damn good"" hotel $1200 knowing I'll need to spend a bit on taxi's. For me, I've decided the value of this place is just too good to pass up, plus I know I'll like it.

For you other folks out there, reading and researching a place, I'd say that if you're looking at checking out Kabukicho, this is an ideal hotel that has service far above any Hilton, Sheraton, Marriott, etc.. you'd find back in the US or Canada. 

Wifi worked flawlessly. Food that we had was good. (we didn't use room service this time). Club lounge was the best I've ever had in a hotel (not that I've had many, but I've had some).",5,2015/04/06
1,REDACTED,en,1718,"Hilton Tokyo is a great hotel in Shinjuku -- the staff is very friendly, and the rooms are a decent size for Tokyo. Bed was quite comfortable and the shower was nice as well. 

I requested a ""standby"" upgraded room, and I would not recommend it. The view we got was OK, and the room size upgrade was not impressive -- it's not worth the extra $25 per day. Breakfast buffet was good but also very expensive (about $35 per person). Internet was also not included - it costs $15 per day.",5,2015/04/04
1,REDACTED,en,1719,"Great Hotel, excellent service, charming staff, very nice, large, well equipped rooms with very comfortable beds. Breakfast buffet is really good. Easy to get to from both Narita and Hameda airports by direct Airport Limousine bus. The Hotel is about 10 minutes walk away from Shinjuku station but the Hotel also has a shuttle bus which runs every 15 minutes. Really its a good hotel for business and leisure but it gets very full very often so book early. One bad thing... internet in the guest room is not free indeed its quite expensive.. it is free in the lobby however so the lobby is always, always cluttered and hard to navigate with so many people on their lap tops and mobile phones.... its petty silly really.",4,2015/04/03
1,REDACTED,en,1720,"Have stayed at this hotel 3x in the last year and half. Service is awesome and rooms are on the large side when compared to typical Japanese hotels. Have been fortunate to get upgraded to their executive rooms which seem to have been renovated and are always clean. Only complaint is that since this is a large hotel you can usually hear foot traffic outside in the hallways as people walk to their rooms. The breakfast downstairs is phenomenal and has a wide variety catering to most taste buds. Love the fact that the hotel has a shuttle service to the Shinjuku train station which makes it convenient for most travellers. 

Can't wait to head back in November.",5,2015/04/03
1,REDACTED,en,1721,I have stayed at this hotel on many occasions and have always had a faultless stay. I have been fortunate to have access to the executive floor where the staff are very attentive. I would recommend this hotel for anyone who needs to travel to Tokyo on business,5,2015/04/01

1,REDACTED,en,1723,"I suppose the main clientele would be the business and corporate travellers that Hilton has for its core business. It's reliable, efficient, has a good buffet breakfast, gym and pool. For the leisure traveller, a hotel closer to the eastern side of Shinjuku station would be better, and to charge for wifi in th room is just plain getting outdated in this day and age. I'm going to try the hotel Century South Tower the next time I visit.",4,2015/04/01
1,REDACTED,en,1724,"We stayed in Hilton Shinjuku for 7 nights. The room on the 26th floor was very comfortable. The staff members were very helpful and courteous. The concierge was patient to respond to my emails (prior to our arrival) regarding various queries and they also booked our Mt Fuji tour. Our safe deposit locker did not work initially but on raising the issue with the house-keeping, the defect was promptly rectified. The breakfast had a wide choice of Japanese and Western food and the omlette station had quite a fast turnaround time. One of the most convenient things about the hotel was that it had an underground shopping arcade with a 24 hr convenience store. The underground tunnels connected the hotel directly to both Tochomae and Nishi-shinjuku subway stations. In addition, the shuttle to Shinjuku station was also very convenient and the bus was always on time. The business centre had several computers and printing maps and boarding cards were very easy and smooth.Overall a very good experience.",5,2015/03/31

It was a very enjoyable stay. The staff was one of the most courteous i've ever met in a hotel. The hotel can seem a little bit run down from the outside but it is very well renovated on the inside. 

I had a room on the 31st floor with a great. It was small compared to american standards but not tiny. The room was clean and fresh. 

The only negatives are the hard mattress but this seems to be standard in all hilton hotels and the absence of free wifi in the room.

Will definitely here again.",5,2015/03/29
1,REDACTED,en,1728,"Hotel room was spotless. Had access to executive level club. Pay a little additional for room but was worth it as the price included breakfast buffet. Concierge was helpful as they arranged a private English speaking tour guide for us prior to our arrival. As this was just at the end of March, trying to book independently was not going to happen as most guides were booked for Cherry Blossom tours.

We met out tour guide and spent a great day seeing the sights, etc. Did a lot of subway and walking combined to see the metro area.

Tour guide gay us a great tip to go up to the observation deck at city hall which was free and you could see Mount Fuji, and the whole metro area for free. 45 floor at city hall.",5,2015/03/28

1,REDACTED,en,1730,"It was our first time in Tokyo and since it was a gift for my husband, I wanted everything to be perfect. Wrote beforehand to make sure the Junior Suite was ready and as soon as we arrived, to our surprise we had an upgrade to the Tower suite. When I was disappointed, there was no welcome basket, Nathan Cook, Director of Operations made it right and made sure the rest of our stay would go smoothly. I recommend Hilton Tokyo 5000 %. The location is great, the staff is uberpolite and very attentive. The Tower suite is very clean, spatious with a great view to Mt Fuji in spite of being on the 15th floor. We had access to the executive lounge which was great from breakfast to cocktail night. Before I came here , I was concerned because of the negative review in here but it turned out that this hotel exceeded my expectations. Just do not complain in here, write to Nathan Cook as stated in his letter of welcome and he will make it right to the best of his ability. Andrew and I will be back next year. Hilton Tokyo was the best place to stay for our visit. Staff was discreet but made sure we were happy.",5,2015/03/28
1,REDACTED,en,1731,"This was our first hotel of four in Tokyo over a two week period. After staying at a variety of different types of hotels, this was an excellent first choice because it was a Hilton property and we knew what to expect. The Hotel itself is a clean, modern and stylish property in a great location for our activities. There was a large wedding taken place and our room was not ready so they upgraded our room to a junior suite which was exceptional! I highly recommend this great hotel!",5,2015/03/28
1,REDACTED,en,1732,We travelled to Tokyo for the first time and spent 5 nights in an executive club room on 25th floor. We did the check-in at the executive lounge where we felt welcome and appreciated by the staff. Our room was nice and clean. The bathroom was quiet small but with a lot of amenities and very clean and fluffy towels. View was great. We were able to have breakfast in the lounge our downstairs at the buffet. Breakfast was opulent with a huge choice of asian and as well western products. Staff was very friendly and quick. Only once on Saturday we had to switch to the lounge breakfast as there was a line of approximately 30 guests waiting. Whenever we got to the lounge staff was welcoming and very friendly. At some time it got a little crowdy. One evening we enjoyed a new lounge due to my gold status. This lounge was even nicer and even more elegant. Different choice of food and more quiet. If you want to take the metro I recommend to use the underground walkway to Nishi-Shinjuku station. There is a hotelbus running every 20 minutes to Shinjuku but sometimes there is a waiting line. Only a 5 minute walk is the Gouverment building with 2 towers where you can enjoy a great Tokyo view for free! All in all we had a terrific stay!,5,2015/03/27

1,REDACTED,en,1734,"I spent one night in a king executive suite which was a great room, well appointed and particularly large for Tokyo standards. The hotel has everything you need and very responsive, professional staff throughout the hotel. I had breakfast included in the main restaurant which was of a high standard with good variety and a mixture of western and Japanese foods. 
I had a shiatsu massage in the fitness centre was was not only great value, but was definitely needed after a very long week of travelling. 
I am a Hilton Diamond HHonors member and other than the complementary WiFi, I did not receive any other benefit or recognition. This isn't an issue as I had everything I needed included in the rate, I have just had different experiences at other Hilton Hotels. 
While the hotel is a couple of blocks from Shinjuku Station an easy 10min walk away, there is a metro station and mall adjacent to the building which is also very convenient.
Overall, a great hotel in a good part of Tokyo.",5,2015/03/26
1,REDACTED,en,1735,"My husband and I stayed here during our second half of our Tokyo trip. The rooms were extremely spacious. We were upgraded to a junior suite (diamond members) but I saw pictures of the regular rooms and they looked very nice. The entire staff was fantastic (housekeeping, front desk, and concierge). It's an extremely busy hotel, however, it is extremely well run and efficient. You barely notice how busy it is. It's next to a train station. The main Shinjuku central station for the Shinkansen is a bit of a hike but they have free shuttles that will take you there. The rooms had great touches such as slippers, robes, Japanese lounging robes, Toto wash stations, great toiletries, nice hair dryers, and even a free daily shoe cleaning service. The executive lounge (free to diamond members) was a nice touch (although closes a little earlier than other executive lounges). There were excellent restaurants. We tried the Chinese restaurant and it was fantastic but pricey. Also, don't order the dimsum breakfast (it's not the same quality as the Chinese restaurant....my husband's order was frozen). Just stick to the regular breakfast menu and you should be fine. The hotel has two bars (one is a downstairs smoking lounge and the other nonsmoking bar is upstairs with the restaurants). The upstairs bar is very well run and the bartenders are excellent. Overall, I would definitely stay here again!",5,2015/03/26

Also tried the Japanese bath and the pool which was really nice. Especially the indoor pool as the weather outside was a bit on the cool side.
Didn't eat much at the hotel but had a burger in restaurant inside the entrance. It was perfectly done which was a star. Tried a sushi one evening too in the hotel sushi restaurant and it wasn't bad, but oooo it was pricey!",4,2015/03/26

From the moment you arrive in the large lobby you feel very welcome in this hotel and it always smells very nice there.
The congierge supplied me with excellent detailed printed instructions to go to Kamakura and with maps of the different area's I wanted to visit in Tokyo.
The room on the 35th floor was very spacious for japanese standard, modern and clean.
The mattress was a comfortable Hilton standard.

It is a 15-20 min to the main Shinjuku station or a shuttle bus is provided by Hilton to ferry visitors to and from the main Shinjuku station (every 20 min from about 8:20 am to 9:40 pm). Fo efficiency, cleanliness and courteousness I give this hotel a very good mark. The breakfast buffet comprises a section of American, Asian and European choices. The offer a variety of coffee drinks, from the regular brew to Cappuccino, iced coffee, etc. 
The rooms are spacious, by Tokyo standards, are clean. Hilton provides complimentary bedroom slippers, toothbrushes and other toiletries. The toilet bowl is very hi-tech complete with bidet, warmer, deodorant, etc. Such toilet bowls are part of the Japanese hotel experience so I am mentioning this in this review. The TV cable has English, French, German, Chinese and of course, Japanese channels.The hotel has gym , sauna and spa facilities. For travellers, book a flight to Tokyo via Haneda airport which is closer to the city than Narita Airport (which is in Chiba district and about 2 hrs away.

1,REDACTED,en,1740,We splurged on our first two nights in Tokyo by staying at the Hilton Shinjuku. Our room was uncharacteristically roomy by Japanese standards. It was beautiful with great amenities and very comfortable. The buffet breakfast is wonderful. It was not part of our (very high) room rate but we sprung for it anyway and were glad.,5,2015/03/24

The people and service are amazing and friendly. the management are really helpful on all the things that i requested even in simple things like, extension of my reservation, food and room preference; i even asked for HDMI cable for my work purpose and they provided it. Indeed it was really a convenient stay for me. They will really find a way to make your request available. 

Big thanks to Ms Maya Kohhara and team for making my stay as comfortable as i was like i am at home. for my never ending request and sudden change of travel schedule, thank again for being available all the time. Keep up the good work Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku and the management. 

I recommend this place for short and long term stay in Tokyo, The location is really good, all accessible to places, walking distance to train stations, bus service from and to, Breakfast food is great and if you happen to have a lounge access then experience what luxury mean. by the way thanks also to Ms Youki Akimoto for our cocktail drinks during friday night. ;) by the way you can request any drink you want by searching online and show it to them, if they can do it and the mix are available they will try to make it for you. Not bad for my Pina colada mix.

BTW bathrooms were totally totally awesome world Class",5,2015/03/22
1,REDACTED,en,1744,"Stayed here for 3 nights on HiltonHonors points. Being a Gold member, we were given complimentary wifi internet and breakfast. We also got a free room upgrade (18th floor).

Check in was a breeze despite the hotel being busy that day (there was some company conference happening that week i think). Though they forgot to give us the internet instructions during the check-in, i easily got it the next morning.

The room we got was spacious and clean. They gave us complimentary bottled water every day. 

Their concierge was excellent. They helped us in reserving seats for two of our dinners. Asked for a reasonable teppanyaki experience and Kohta gave us a good restaurant recommendation. Thank you, Kohta. :-)

The hotel is near the Marunochi line which we used going to Tsukiji and Ginza. A complimentary shuttle to Shinjuku station is available if you want to use the JR line. We used it upon arriving from Kyoto, and on times we went sightseeing.

The airport limo bus stops at this hotel so instead of taking the Narita express going home (that's what we used when we first arrived in Japan), we asked the hotel to book us for the 9 AM trip.

Cons:

This is minor but of the 4 hotels we stayed at, this is the only hotel that did not keep the toilet seat warmer on. I had to turn it on by myself. 

I had to ask for some toiletries such as cotton buds from the housekeeping. Those things are already considered standard in other hotels I believe.

The staff is really heplful and they can speak english. Ask for higher floor etc 36 floor like we do and you will have tokyo view. We stay at junior suite and the room is spacious. Kids love it. But we dont take the free upgraded since we want to have the view. Executive room is not at the higher floor.,5,2015/03/20
1,REDACTED,en,1746,"I stayed here with a group of friends and I tried 3 different rooms, standard king, jr king suite and one of the large top floor executive suites. All were immaculately clean. The jr king suite was the best value I thought.
Breakfast was really good, lots of choices, Japanese and European.
Concierge desk was amazingly helpful, they knew about most things and if they didn't know the answer they would find out for you.
Helpful hints - use the door staff to tell the taxi drivers where to go before you get in if you don't speak Japanese.
The service and staff at the teppanyaki restaurant were excellent, the food was fairly plain for the money, maybe over priced I think, but great to have within the hotel.
Figure out how to get to and from the tube stations before you head there.
The staff were all excellent.

1,REDACTED,en,1749,The Tokyo Hilton is a large and comfortable hotel in Shinjuku section of Tokyo. We caught a suite deal online and our huge junior suite with breakfast was under $200 a day and very worth it. Lots in the neighborhood to eat/drink. Pretty shrine just a block away and garden a block the other way. Since our guide picked us up each day transportation was not an issue. Airport bus was seen right in front of hotel and the world's busiest train station is just 2-3 blocks away. The best thing we did at this hotel was have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches looking out on the neon lights of Tokyo -- just like being in the space station. Something special for us.,4,2015/03/18
1,REDACTED,en,1750,"I was here for a holiday and booked it because it's a Hilton, but far from impressed. In fact, a bit disappointed once I arrived and saw the hotel. 

Not the best location for a holiday to explore the city. It's a nice walk to Aoyama. Great place to explore. Apart from that, there isn't much fun to stick around the Hilton neighborhood itself so you really need that subway nearby to get to elsewhere. 

Tried in-room massage. Just average. 

Overall an average hotel more catered for business travellers. I won't stay here again. So many better choices in this city. I'd go stay again either at Chinzanso (formerly Four Seasons) for the luxury and tranquility, or the Marunouchi Hotel right next to the Tokyo Station, which is super convenient.",3,2015/03/16

The service at the front desk and concierge was great. We were upgraded upon check in and were given a huge suite, which had great views to My Fuji and the facilities were amazing. Breakfast was well worth the money, with a large range of western and Japanese food available. The concierge helped us with any tourist and transport questions that we had. The biggest drawback was not having wifi in the room. I couldn't understand how a hotel of this calibre and price were still charging if you wanted wifi anywhere but the foyer.",4,2015/03/16
1,REDACTED,en,1752,"I stayed at the Hilton Tokyo from 30th Jan 2015 to 5th Feb 2015.

I booked a Junior King Suite but was upgraded to a Junior King Executive Suite as part of my HHonor Gold benefits.

Location:
The Hilton is located some distance away from Shinjuku station. However, I did not find this to be a major problem as access via the Hilton Shuttle Bus (10min between hotel and shinjuku station) was convenient. In addition, stations leading to the Marunouchi line and Oedo line were within walking distance. 

Shinjuku is only 30min away from HND airport. I would definitely stay here if flying into HND.

Room:
The rooms were recently renovated and was well appointed. There is plenty of space, being a suite with good AV appointments. The furniture looked fresh and the style was that of modern Japanese. Notably, the bathrooms were on the smaller side, but this is to be expected of Tokyo. The standard nespresso was also available for use. The TV could be attached to HDMI for guests who are interested in watching videos from their laptop. The in-room wifi is decently fast as well.

Executive lounge:
The exec lounge serves breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails. The lounge staff are extremely courteous with a good range of alcohol available during cocktail hour. The views from the lounge are also great. This is a good place to relax after a day out. 

Breakfast at restaurant:
Wider range of breakfast items compared to the EL but with comparable quality. Extremely crowded as everyone is having breakfast here. If one was in a rush, the EL would be a preferable place to have breakfast. Items are not especially remarkable. They have a live egg station as well as Japanese breakfast which is quite delicious.

In all, Hilton Tokyo is good value if one can get it during a Hilton Sale. 



Service:",5,2015/03/16
1,REDACTED,en,1753,"Very busy hotel. 800 rooms and often full. Very interesting vibe in the lobby with so many different nationalities, flight attendants etc. 
Concierge offer great quick service. Front desk is very busy but quite often have 6+ staff on at the desk which I rarely see anywhere else. A MUCH faster experience than check in at the Osaka Hilton. 
Rooms are beautiful, great views. Fitness is great. One of the few hotels that I know of in Japan that do NOT charge a fee to use the sauna, gym, pool. (ALL Starwood hotels in Japan charge $30 or more to use the pool or sauna.) Fitness staff are very personable and friendly. Often hotels in Japan (including American chains) have the fitness WOMEN walking around the men's locker room, baths/sauna etc. amongst all the naked men which can make for a very uncomfortable experience. Hilton Tokyo is one of the few hotels where they respect the privacy and comfort of the guest and only allow male staff to enter the men's locker room/sauna/baths.
The club lounge can be VERY crowded and guests are sometimes turned away. They have recently added another room for the diamond and gold members to enjoy the evening cocktails and snacks. Great cocktails, snacks and service.
My only complaint about this hotel is that the fitness club has a Golden Key fitness membership for outside/local people (not guests staying at the hotel). A few of these outside members are the rudest Japanese I have ever come across. There are many rules and customs for the Japanese bath and I have witnessed on several occasions JAPANESE (mostly the members) breaking these rules. They are very loud in the relaxation lounge, take 2-3 large towels and 2-3 gowns (what are they going to do with 3 gowns?) from the staff's towel supply locker, they go from the sauna directly to the bath without showering off first (or splashing water on themselves), they wear their swimsuits into the bath, dunk their large towels into the cold plunge bath to use in the sauna, ring their wet towels over the sauna stove/soak the sauna stove with water making it more like a steam room (this is a dry sauna not a wet sauna so I think this is dangerous to do). They also bend over a lot to wash their bums and the water sprays into the baths and onto other guests. A few of these Golden Key members are rude and selfish to other guests as well as to the staff. I think the hotel should limit the Golden Key members time at the gym. For example from 8pm to close only hotel guests staying overnight can use the gym/spa.",5,2015/03/15

They have shuttle to and from Shinjuku, but what I found it most convenient is it's connected to both Nishi-Shinjuku Station and Tochomae Station, which both are run by Tokyo Metro trains so be sure to get the multiple day Metro tickets at the airport. Hotel staffs are very courteous and helpful. If you are like me the prime objective in Tokyo is dining then you will find their concierge team very helpful.",5,2015/03/09
1,REDACTED,en,1760,"Stayed 3 nights in Feb 2015 in an executive room. Room was very spacious, especially so for Tokyo standards. 

Lounge was the place where we got our daily dose of fruits and juices. We had a choice of breakfast at either the lobby restaurant or the lounge. The lounge was missing an egg station, but we chose to have breakfast at the lounge as it was less busy. They also had onsen tamago which were made to perfection. 

Lounge staffs and concierge were excellent. They assisted with restaurants reservation, provided maps and directions to places we wanted to visit, and also made bookings for the bus to the airport. 

The hotel is located on the business side of Shinjuku, so if you want to experience the busy night life you will need to walk 15 minutes to the kabuki-cho side. There is a convenience store just below the hotel. The hotel is located beside a hospital, so there will be an off chance you will hear siren in the middle of the night. 

Will I stay again? Definitely.",5,2015/03/08

Service was amazing from the moment we arrived to the hotel to the minute we departed. Breakfast buffet was very good with both japanese and western offerings.
We used this hotel for the Tokyo marathon, if you are planning to use it for that event it is just a block away from the start line.",5,2015/03/08

The buffet breakfast is fantastic which so many selection, you could eat something different everyday for a week. Upgrade to the executive level where the lounge has 5 food presentations throughout the day. Soft drinks, beer, tea, coffee and bottled water always available. Nice cocktail hour in the evening and light snacks offered during lunchtime. Comfortable room and large bathroom with both shower and separate tub.

1,REDACTED,en,1764,"We stayed at Hilton for 4 nights in a King Suite while holidaying in Japan.

The room was lovely and the facilities good. A large selection of restaurants, good room service menu and convenient shuttle to Shinjuku. The rooms themselves were clean and spacious (although a little extra room on the counter in the bathroom would have been good).

There was a Nespresso machine in the room which was an extremely impressive touch.

However, the main downside was that there was no free internet in the rooms. This meant either going to the foyer /restaurant area or paying for it in room - at the outrageous price of 17,000 yen per day! That is nearly a month of Internet charge back at home! I really have come to expect free wifi services - particularly at rather expensive and upmarket hotels. 

Please Hilton, reconsider this policy! But for this issue, it would have been a 5-star review!",4,2015/03/08
1,REDACTED,en,1765,"Stayed there for 3 nights for a business trip. The location is a bit calm; but within 15 minutes walking you are in the more interesting parts of Shinjuku. Stayed in a King Jr Suite Executive and it was probably the most spacious and stylish rooms I have stayed in Tokyo. Nice views from large windows, perfect shower and comfortable. Incredibly fast (wired) internet. Very much appreciated are the free waters and the Nespresso machine (should be a standard in every hotel room!). The executive floor is a bit on the small side and at breakfasts a bit crowded. Food was perfect. Would stay there again.",4,2015/03/07
1,REDACTED,en,1766,"This is the second time which I stay in this hotel. I like the location of the hotel. The surrounding is very calm and quiet. At the same time, it is very close to the busy central Shinjuku with plenty of restaurants, shops, and many choice of transportation. From the airport to hotel is easy, airport limo bus will take you to the door step of the hotel. Subway and train are very to access from the hotel. All staff in the hotel are friendly, helpful, and speaking very good English. They do ensure your stay is an enjoyable one. Everyone there is trying to do the best. I really appreciate their effort. 

Highly recommended!

1,REDACTED,en,1767,"This is a nice hotel and very expensive. They seem to have many functions bringing people in form outside the hotel. I found it was difficult to get a table in the bars/restaurants because of this. My overriding complaint is that even though it is a very expensive hotel, Hilton insist on charging 1700yen per day for Internet access. With 800 rooms this means the potential to charge 1,360,000 (£7,500, €10,300 or $11,300) per day for Internet access. Now I know they will say it is free in public areas, but if you cannot find anywhere in the public areas because of all the events they have going on, it is not much use. Shame on you Hilton Hotels for still charging for Wi-Fi, when the hotel is so expensive in any event.",3,2015/03/06
1,REDACTED,en,1768,"Stayed at Hilton Tokyo in Shinjuku area of Tokyo for business. Loved the hotel. Here's what I specifically liked:

*Staff was very attentive and helpful
*executive king room was large and really nice. Bed was comfortable, bathroom was nice, big desk, separate sofa with great view of Tokyo.
*breakfast on the 37th floor was included in my rate. View was beautiful from up there and the breakfast was delicious. Hot and cold items.
*great location near Shinjuku train station. Lots of restaurants and shops nearby
*official Disney bus leaves from Keio Plaza Hotel which is only 2 blocks away.
*delicious lunch buffet with lots of variety.
*if you care about the toiletry amenities - they were fully stocked in the bathroom including shower cap. They use Peter Roth Thomas products. 

No complaints about this hotel!",5,2015/03/06
1,REDACTED,en,1769,"I stayed here during the Tokyo Marathon. For the marathon it is a great choice since it is very close to the marathon start. Rooms and service are the standard Hilton issued experience. It was a busy time at the hotel and the staff handled it well. 

Some things that stood out:
The concierge staff were extremely professional given the volume of requests during this visit. 
The hotel shuttle to and from Shinjuku station (used by everyone, not just hotel guests) was convenient (leaves every 20 minutes from the station). A Tokyo metro stop is also attached to the hotel and can be accessed via an underground walkway. 
Hiltopia - an underground area with shops had a convenience market that was good for getting water and snacks.

Service in the Metropolitan grill was top notch with great wine options. 

In room massage was great, but it is done on the bed which took some accepting. Again the fitness staff was extremely accommodating given the volume of requests for messages after the marathon. 

They were also kind to switch my coins to paper money at the Front Desk

Things that should be addressed:
The mold in the window area in the room. 
I tried two times to grab a drink in the lobby bar/restaurant and both times I was turned away because I didn't have a reservation. They hold a dessert hour in the lobby restaurant that is very popular and always fully booked. Lunch time also seems to be peak time too, I've never experienced this at a Hilton lobby bar/restaurant before-but they should give tips to other locations on how to build demand.

Room service menu was very limited- unless my book was missing a page or two. 
Internet fee was steep, but there is free internet in the lobby-but very few places to sit to try to use it (see note above about lobby bar)

I dined twice (one by choice, the other because I was turned away from the lobby restaurant) and they are indeed pricey. They were also popular as well. 

The area has lots of options for food in the other buildings surrounding the hotel and Shinjuku station can get you to just about anywhere in Tokyo. 

If you are coming for the marathon it is a great choice, I'm not sure I'd stay there otherwise.",3,2015/03/05

Everything is very clean and tidy. Big advantage, you get many western tv and moviechannels. Not usual in many other japanese hotels. The rooms on the top floors have a beautifull view over Tokyo.

1,REDACTED,en,1779,"Being a Gold member of Hilton Hhonors and have been travelling extensively in the last couple of years, spending numerous nights in Hilton group hotels (ranging from New York, Sydney, Singapore, London, Macau, Beijing and Southern part of China), Hilton Tokyo is really a 5 star hotel that seldomly gave me the impression of slightly lack of warmth & hospitality for my stay, even this (in Feb 2015) was my repeated stay, since my first stay with Hilton Tokyo was just one year ago (in Jan 2014).

It offered all the basic 5 star services and facilities and also tried to provide some value added services to business travellers ; but sadly enough, my stay was not for business, so i would expect the hotel staff would be greatly friendly and treated me & my travel partner with care ; unfortunately, i really can't feel the sense of belongings, nor distinguished services provided to me nor to my travel partner.

I did got the upgrade to the Executive floor (thanks to the front desk staff during my check in, he was the only hotel staff that greeted us well so far i recalled), but the overall services provided by the Executive lounge to us were far from satisfaction.

The Wi-fi connection at the Executive lounge is fine ; but the in-room internet connection provided by i-Ban was really bad, and actually i have not been able to connect the internet successfully in my own room during my whole stay ; i really don't have the time to ring up IT dept to help, coz' my time in Tokyo is precious, but trust me, i have never experienced such problem in any of the Hilton group hotels before.

Those readers who have read my hotel reviews in the past, you may note that this is my first time to comment a hotel like this.............anyway, i am simply trying to express frankly what i have experienced and to share with Tripadvisor's readers here and hope Hotel Tokyo won't be blindly spoiled by those 10/10 surveys...........the business travellers could select 10 out of 10 (100% satisfied) simply because the Company paid for them and they really don't care ; but in a long run, most of the Companies would cut cost and limit business travels ; so your future hotel guests are those who are loyal and happy to spend their own money to those 5 star hotels with superb services and also highly friendly and care for their loyal customers, like myself.",3,2015/02/28

There is a convenience store in the mall that is open 24 hrs where you can buy water, snacks and drinks and even some souvenirs/trinkets. I would have given this hotel a 5-star but for not having a free wi-fi in the room though there is a free wi-fi in the lobby. All in all a great place to stay when visiting Tokyo.",4,2015/02/27

The have a gym, very small and not everything there for a good workout. They also have a small pool and gym. 
The Breakfast is very nice, but also VERY busy, at times you have to line up, just to get in and also you have to line up, to get food, that's very unfortunate, because that reduces the enjoyment a lot. At my stay the hotel was so very busy, that you had to line up for everything.

It's a bit of a walk to Shinjuku station, but there is a shuttle if you want it and there are a huge number of restaurants and stores near there. The breakfast buffet was amazing-- again, the best I've had. The rooms were quiet and had great views. I can't think of anything bad to say about this hotel; it was great value for the money.",5,2015/02/23
1,REDACTED,en,1787,"First off, I am a Hilton Honors Gold member, and therefore a few perks were entitled to me such as free wi-fi (although it wasn't needed as I rented a mobile wi-fi device) and free breakfast (YUM!). My wife and I stayed at this Hilton for 3 nights. 

I have to say that I do indeed agree with some of the other reviewers in stating that this Hilton is quite busy. Therefore, there are lines to check-in/check-out and breakfast. With that said, it is really no different than most Hiltons in large cities such as Hilton New York and Millenium Hilton in NYC.

Breakfast was one of the best I have had in any Hilton hotels. It is a mix of Japanese and Continental breakfast, so a little of something for everyone. I personally enjoyed the Japanese breakfast. After all, I did not go to Tokyo to eat something that can be had everyday. 

Service was excellent as well, from the front desk to the concierge. Staff was extremely friendly, polite and helpful. Again, better than any other Hilton (or Waldorf) that I have stayed at. 

Location wise, it is convenient enough for me. There was a shuttle bus to the train station and also a subway stop close to the hotel. With prior research done, I got the Suica pass (pre-paid subway card) and mostly used the subway. It was a life saver as I did not have to figure out how much fare needed to be paid from one stop to another (and the signs were mostly in Japanese). It all depends on what you are looking for. 

I arrived late on my first night and my wife and I wanted to grab a quick bite. The concierge made an excellent recommendation for a Japanese restaurant (Izakaya style) that was about 10 minutes walk from the hotel. The food was excellent and the restaurant was open late (12 am +). 

All in all, it was a great experience and I would highly recommend this Hilton. Keep in mind that they are busy.",5,2015/02/23

Pros - Good size room (executive twin), clean, nice amenities, good breakfast, friendly staff and cleaners, nice view, location

Cons - Very crowded, front desk always jam packed, got neglected during both check in and check out, no service provided for luggage. The executive lounge was also very busy whenever we went.

Overall I was satisfied because the staff really tried their best and the issues were clearly a management problem by not hiring more people.

Top tip - If you are on a tight schedule, allocate more time to checking in and out. Breakfast and wifi are included if you are staying in an executive room.",4,2015/02/18
1,REDACTED,en,1793,"This is a nice property with good beds. That's there all the nice things I can say end. I stay I'm hotels about 160 days a year so not a rookie traveler. I normally stay at places that I can get a fair deal and benefits as a Member. I used to stay at many Hilton's and due to location haven't stayed at many in past few years. I decided to give them a try instead of normal hotels in Tokyo. 

Check in even though I have reservation from online took exceptional long. Then the up sales start, internet at ¥1500 a day (no thanks) Breakfast at ¥2500 @ day ( on line its ¥3000) save the money and time go to Denney's their food is better and as the service. 

The straw the broke the camels back was I decided to try the on site steak house meal was good service was as expected. When departing to return to room was told by a security guard I couldn't use the elevator on second floor as it seems these greedy folks decided to put a ""club"" in the second floor hallway area and was told I needed to pay 2000Yen. 
In all honesty this place is over ran with Chinese tourists and they treat all guest like that. 

Recommend any other of the 6 Hotels in the area. Never ever will I step foot in this site. 

You have been warned!!!",2,2015/02/17

1,REDACTED,en,1796,"The Tokyo Hilton is conveniently located within walking distance to Shinjuku (20mins) and Harajuku (a little further) and close to two metro lines that can be reached by underground walkways. It's a great luxurious hotel with all the amenities one would expect. Entering the hotel for the first time I noticed just how busy it is in the lobby. There are numerous check-in desks but still there seemed to be lots of people queuing. Having booked a room on the executive floors, it was very handy to have the option to check in at the Executive Lounge where there was no queue. The staff there were extremely friendly and helpful throughout our stay, assisting us with all our needs and questions. We were happy with the room and the bed was very comfortable.
On our first morning at the Hilton we had breakfast at the huge restaurant in the lobby and did not take to that very much as it was extremely busy and we had a hard time manœuvring back to the table from the buffet with our plates. The choice of food was good but the coffee was on the weak side.
We also had, included in our room rate, the option to have breakfast in the Executive Lounge which we tried the next morning. It was a significantly more pleasant affair, away from the hustle and bustle of the hotel lobby and with a great view of Tokyo and Mt Fuji. From six in the evening they also offer free alcoholic drinks/cocktails and light snacks in the same lounge for Executive Floor guests. We started all of our four evenings spent in Tokyo there with great sunset views, charming service and a Gin and Tonic in hand.
A special thank you to the concierge service for tracking down an item somebody had dropped off for us without a room number and the wrong name on it. 
I recommend basing yourself here for your stay in Tokyo, but make sure you fork out a little extra for access to the Executive Lounge. It will be worth it.",4,2015/02/16

Having no choice and not to cause a hassle to my husband who is a smoker, we need to opt for standard twin smoking room on 34th floor, i.e. there will be no refund on the amount we pay for the executive king room due to the non-existence room type as mentioned by the front desk. We appreciate the front desk personnel for making an effort in making good of the situation but would like to suggest that specific room details should be made known to third party's agent rather than the guests having to take the stress upon check-in. We would also like to bring the attention of the door hanger where both sides showed ""Please Do Not Disturb"" instead of ""Clean Up Room"" on the other side. We discover the same words on both sides of the door hanger only when we arrived back at the hotel at 4.30pm and the room was not cleaned for the whole day.

Excellent for business purpose stay. Recommended as well for non-business stay, such for couples' romantic stay.",5,2015/02/09
1,REDACTED,en,1804,"The location of this hotel is perfect for a visit to Tokyo as it's about a 10 minute walk to Shinjuku station and the heart of the entertainment district. The rooms were well appointed although, if you want a bathtub, you may need to request it as we were traveling with another couple and their room had one and ours didn't even though we had the same ""type"" of room. The bed was ok, if a bit on the hard side.

Don't bother with the restaurants in the hotel. We ate at the Chinese one the night we arrived in Tokyo as we were exhausted and just wanted something quick to eat before we went to sleep. The front desk recommended the restaurants in the hotel and the Chinese one was the only one that was even remotely reasonably priced (it was still about $60 pp without alcohol). I don't mind spending money on a good meal but the prices at the restaurants in this hotel were straight up criminal for the quality of food. It really wasn't anything special.

The service here was also a little iffy. I am definitely not one of those people who thinks that everyone in a foreign country should speak English but I will say that after two weeks in Japan, it was a bit surprising that the least proficient staff we encountered was at this hotel. We asked to have our bags forwarded to our next hotel in Hakuba (something very commonly done in Japan) and even though we said that there was a similarly named hotel to the one we were staying at in the area and to be sure that the right hotel address was written down (I gave them the correct hotel name and address) they sent our luggage to the wrong hotel. The concierge also told us it may take us two days to get to Nagano which is crazy considering the train ride is 90 minutes on the Shinkansen. I guess he was trying to account for bad weather but even so, you'd think if you're giving travel advice you'd want to be at least somewhat accurate (the weather forecast was fine for the day we were supposed to leave). 

Lastly, give yourself sufficient time to take the elevator down from your room. Multiple times during our stay the elevators were too full to get on.

Overall, I don't think this would be my first choice to stay for my next visit to Tokyo. The location is great but the lapses in service and the issues with the elevators would me think twice about booking them again.

1,REDACTED,en,1805,"Located in a very convenient location, and very nice. Several good restaurants are in walking distance. Also the shuttle to Shinjuku Station was a big help. The staff was very helpful and kind. My only complaint was the room lacked free coffee, but that is more nit-picking than anything. I would recommend this place for anyone wanting an enjoyable, no-hassle, place to stay in Shinjuku (or Tokyo in general).",5,2015/02/08
1,REDACTED,en,1806,"Booked on basis of location - ideally placed for station - and value for money as Toyko is expensive!
Rooms small but quiet and acceptable with comfortable bed. Bathroom tiny for two, but it was functional.
Club lounge on top floor for breakfast and cocktail hour reasonable, with ok selection of hot snacks and canapes, good choice of drinks including champagne.
Staff on the whole good, check in staff on ground floor bit officious, but I don't think they mean anything by it. Concierge very helpful in sending off documents and directions.
Would stay again",4,2015/02/08

In other countries, I've stayed at the Mandarin, Fourseasons and others. My family want to thank all the executive lounge staff for making us feel so welcome! We will definitely return and this will be our home in Tokyo!",5,2015/02/07

1,REDACTED,en,1809,"A good business hotel in the heart of Shinjuku. Clean and spacious room with a great view. Breakfast is being served in the Lobby Area which is not really convenient because of the hassle near the entrance.
Staff is friendly and helpful . Quality of W - Lan Connection in the room ( 1.700,- Y) is poor when using more than one device.",4,2015/02/01

1,REDACTED,en,1811,"We wanted to upgrade to an executive room so we'd have a good view. None of the executive rooms were available so we were put on the 20th floor. The room was large and the view was ok. Excellent breakfast buffet and free shuttle to the bus station. We took the airport limo and it was good value for the money and time. I did, however, get bus sick on the way to the airport. The Hilton is the last stop for the airport limo so there's not much choice for seats. The Hilton was predictable and our only surprise was how unpredictable the concierge desk was. Several of the staff seemed to dislike their job and our questions irritated them. After the excellent service in Kyoto at the Granvia Hotel we were unpleasantly surprised by Hilton.",4,2015/01/29
1,REDACTED,en,1812,"The location is impeccable. The free hotel shuttle to Shinjuku station is very helpful. Check in and door staff were excellent. Breakfast was sumptous. Rooms were very decent sized for Tokyo and the hotel very well maintained. So why the but... 

On the day of departure there was a really dour looking lady working on the computer at the concierge when we approached her to pass her our tickets for the airport express. She wasn't very approachable at all. Maybe she wasn't a staff of the concierge. Luckily for us, another much nicer staff approached us very quickly and helped us instead. This is unpleasant staff, of course, is highly atypical of Hilton, or for that matter, any staff working in Japan. So sometimes a small unpleasant experience can affect the whole impression of an otherwise really good place.",4,2015/01/28
1,REDACTED,en,1813,"Great location with the direct availability of the Airport Limosine Bus. From the hotel, it is easy to travel within Tokyo as there is a direct Metro station from the basement and the free shuttle bus to ShinJuku Station. Nice view of you get the top floors and the size of the rooms are pretty decent. My only negative experience was the Concierge Desk who were not too friendly and doesn't seem keen to provide services to others. This is in total contrast to the check-in desks who are prompt and professional with their services which is a kudos to the hotel.",5,2015/01/27
1,REDACTED,en,1814,"Firstly the cons:
The lobby are constantly packed with people from guests to visitors. The hotel clearly cater more towards tour packages from china and taiwan. I have also seen airline staff from singapore airlines and another european airline(I think it is lufthansa).

Can't really say much about the service as I have received none. I had some china tourist who tried jumping the queue which annoyed me. Their constant shouting in the lobby irks me as well.

Now to the good stuff,
The room is beautiful and well renovated. We had the King jnr suite which is easily well worth the slight premium.

Location is decent and shuttle bus provided. china tourist don't really take the shuttle bus much therefore we did not have much bad experience.

Airport limo goes right to the door step.",4,2015/01/27

The club lounge had a great view and was comfortable as well. Will stay again for sure!!!,5,2015/01/27
1,REDACTED,en,1816,"Stayed here after Far East Russian Cruise. I had gone for executive room and found simply no faults with it. Staff in Executive Lounge were extremely helpful. Lounge food and alcohol plentiful. Well situated for touring around Tokyu with a shuttle bus provided to take you to station.. Also a pick -up stop for bus going out to Narita airport. 
Views across the city from the lounge were outstaning.
The onLy minor drawback was and extremely busy lobby but this was probably because the hotel was very busy. One restaurant was also being refurbished when I was there.
Would highly recommend.",5,2015/01/27
1,REDACTED,en,1817,Rooms are spacious and clean. I like free shuttle service provided by Hilton. Free shuttle to Shinjuku station and nearby shopping centers. Bath room and toilet is easy to use. The service staff is very friendly and they can speak English.,4,2015/01/27
1,REDACTED,en,1818,"We booked the Hilton for our last night in Japan as we wanted some luxury and a decent nights sleep. We also felt that as it was 5*, we would appreciate the facilities.

On arrival, we booked in and were shown to our rooms on the 32nd floor. Yes, the room was bigger and the bed very very comfy, we were surprised by the distinct lack of WiFi in our room and the lack of complimentary items.
In the other places we have stayed-these are standard-even in the capsule hotels, WiFi is complimentary!!! To get WiFi, you have to go to the main lobby but it is so busy and there is nowhere to sit. It's also not very private.
Everything in this hotel is incredibly expensive and is no better than anywhere else we stayed.

Whilst I understand The Hilton has a good reputation and basically rides on its name, we felt the hotel needed massive updating, better facilities and to be honest rethink your ridiculous pricing!
We also found that whilst your front of house spoke good English, the rest of the staff didn't and we found that a problem when the kettle broke in our room.

We stayed in better places for have the price and can honestly say we won't stay in a Hilton hotel again.

1,REDACTED,en,1819,"Wonderful friendly and helpful staff, clean with a lovely decor, very nice stay. The food was great and our view of the city was phenomenal.

Hotel was grand with generously spaced rooms.
Service staff were polite and professional from check-in to check-out, really helpful bunch. 

Location is well situated in Shinjuku and connected directly via underground passageway to Nishi-Shinjuku station. Very convenient if you're not keen on waiting 20 mins for the hotel shuttle bus or the 10 min walk to Shinjuku station.

Breakfast buffet at the Marble Lounge was good, buffet lines were busy in the morning. I felt 1 breakfast was good enough - I spent the rest of the time in Tokyo venturing out there for other local food options.
Will return to stay for the convenience and good location.",4,2015/01/24
1,REDACTED,en,1821,This was our second stay at this property. We were upgraded to a Jr. Suite on the Executive floor and it all went uphill from there. Every request was honored and responded to very quickly. This is now my hotel of choice in Tokyo.,5,2015/01/22
1,REDACTED,en,1822,This hotel is pretty much what you would expect from the Hilton. The service was reasonable and the guest facilities and restaurants well looked after. Beware visiting at New Year.

1,REDACTED,en,1823,"Over a period of many years, on many occasions, I've stayed in the Hilton Tokyo. Of all the hotels in Shinjuku and the surrounding area, it's still my favorite for many reasons. The staff is always amazing and somehow always managed to remember my name and my preferences. The upper suite-style rooms are spacious even on Japanese terms. I found it to be quiet at night (which is good), and yet, still a short walk from all the hustle-bustle that you can find just beyond the train station. Just about every kind of food available in Japan can be found within 10 minutes walk with a lot more just beyond. For me, arriving in the hotel always felt like I was home again. I can't wait to go back...",5,2015/01/21
1,REDACTED,en,1824,A lot of amenities that are included in other upscale hotels were ala carte here. We had a lovely view of Tokyo from our room. Used points and only stayed Dec. 25-26. Took train to Tokyo Sky Tree from here. That was wonderful.,3,2015/01/20
1,REDACTED,en,1825,"I recently stayed at this property. Overall a very nice hotel. Staff was very friendly. Room was comfortable. Check in and out was simple. Convenient location. I had the hotel arrange a private taxi with English speaking driver for me to tour rather than go on group tour. It is much more expensive than bus tour but worth every dollar! I had the car for 9 hours and saw everything I wanted and more. Didn't feel rushed and the driver offered to take me other places which was great. If you're not on a budget I suggest hiring a taxi. The only concern I had with the hotel was the cost of food. the food was VERY expensive in this hotel. I have traveled the world and stayed at many Hiltons and don't recall paying $35 usd for a Cheese burger!! I had a soda and burger that cost about $40. No this was not room service... This was in the lounge on first floor. I don't mind paying for a good meal but this was expensive and to top it off it was not good. I had a friend that ordered separately.... pizza... and she said it was also pricey and not that great.
I had breakfast at Dennys at the corner everyday and it was worth it.
Overall I wish I could give a 4.5... I would definitely stay there again.

Breakfast buffet is expensive but is amazing. If buffet is not included in your rate, it gets a bit confusing for the staff as each morning we had to ask for the bill and had to stress that we only had the continental breakfast. But loved the staff and the feel of the place. I do hope we can stay here again. Very close to the Shinjuku train station. The Japanese bath in the fitness center was definitely a different cultural experience!",5,2015/01/18

They are within walking distance from the Shinjuku station but it was very easy to take the Hilton shuttle which runs every 20 minutes. 
We took the Limo Bus from Narita which drops you off at the front door to the hotel. 
The rooms are very nice and the staff was great. We were upgraded and had access to the executive lounge which got very busy in the evenings",5,2015/01/15

I look forward to coming back! I particularly enjoyed the gym and spa. The service was great. The attendants were always welcoming and quite helpful. The next time I come, I'll definitely get a massage. I'm sure that will be great, too. I totally recommend this hotel for business or holiday, just leave your children at home.",5,2015/01/15
1,REDACTED,en,1830,"We arrived via the Hilton courtesy bus from Shinjuku station. Our suitcases were taken from us and we were deposited into a lift to the 37th floor to check-in in the executive lounge. Our greeting at the lounge was warm and genuine and we were invited to sit on a sofa during the formalities.
Our e-standby upgrade request was honoured and thus room changed from my booked Executive Double to a Junior Executive Suite - and at a very reasonable cost too.
It was now 10:00, 4 hours before the earliest check-in, yet to our enormous gratitude we were invited to check into our room immediately. 
I was aware that a package had been left at the hotel reception for me the previous day, from my Mum, who was a guest at another local hotel. The package was delivered - without any prompting from me - moments after we checked in. 
We had occasion to visit the Executive lounge several times during our 4 night stay. Each time we were greeted warmly and remembered by the staff (which was appreciated as it avoided us ever having to 'prove' our status by showing the room key sleeve). To me, the above demonstrates perfect attention to detail by the team there. Despite being young and casually dressed (this was a holiday, not business), we were treated equally as well as all other patrons. I cannot speak highly enough of the service provided by the entire Exec lounge staff, absolutely flawless, pre-emptive, and courteous.
Our Junior Suite prompted mixed feelings. The space was fantastic, particularly by Tokyo standards, and the decor modern and minimalist. We appreciated the Nespresso machine, iPhone dock and the free wi-fi. Although the wi-fi worked well, I thought it odd that it only allowed us to connect three devices for free, though to the hotels credit, this problem was fixed immediately by a call to guest services who provided me with a complimentary pass-code for more devices (as a couple we carry a mobile phone each, a work mobile each, an ipad each and potentially a laptop each... this is fairly standard I expect, so a limit of three devices is baffling).
My constructive feedback on the suite, however, is that the bathroom is shamefully small in a room of that size. To give you an idea of how small I mean, it is no exaggeration to tell you that unless you are rather slim you will not be able to open the shower door if the bathroom door is closed. Once inside the shower cubicle you find it is 'wet room' style. A nice idea, and it looks great, but the determination to squeeze both a bathtub and a shower area in results in a bathtub that is too small to relax in, and a shower whose water flow mostly falls inside the bathtub rather than the shower pan. A really poor design which is frustrating to use and defines the phrase 'style over substance'!
Back to the positives, and I'm pleased to say the bed was huge and comfortable, and despite our ultra-last minute room change at check in, our pre-ordered pillow menu requests still reached the new room before we did - kudos to the excellent housekeeping team.
Breakfast was very nice. We chose to dine in the Marble lounge each morning so cannot comment on the light breakfast served in the Exec lounge. Although the choice of both Western and Eastern breakfasts was fairly extensive, it did not change at all during our 4 mornings there. What was exciting on morning one became dull by morning 4. The wait staff, whilst lovely, are painfully slow to serve coffee - which I notice has been picked up by previous reviewers - and is perhaps an area for the restaurant management to focus on, and the only English newspaper available is the FT - which is perhaps a tad heavy going whilst on holiday! Besides that, the restaurant itself is beautifully appointed and very comfortable.
Overall, this was an excellent experience. We would not hesitate to return, and indeed I am sure we will. With the possible exception of one stern, grumpy egg chef, each and every other staff member we encountered is an absolute credit to the hotel, and made our stay unforgettable for all the right reasons. Thank you Hilton for a great stay.",5,2015/01/14
1,REDACTED,en,1831,"Other than the great rate I get, the Hilton is still my favorite hotel in Tokyo. The new refurbished rooms are nice and stylish. Though the size of the room is not the best, the new rooms are great and really makes the experience different and refreshing. The lounge team recognizes how busy things can be and reserved another room for Diamond members, which is a nice touch. Service in Japan is always great and no different here at the Hilton. Location is walking distance from Nishi-Shinjuku station and there is the shuttle to Shinjuku station so it is just simply convenient.",5,2015/01/12
1,REDACTED,en,1832,"Stays for business for several night as was impressed with the quality of the room, service and food. Only real gripe was that its expensive but, that is most often the case with Tokyo hotels. Location is great right near the centre of Shinjuku which was convenient for both business, dining and shopping needs. Would definitely consider staying here again when in Tokyo.",4,2015/01/12
1,REDACTED,en,1833,"I chose this hotel for its room design which was modern and clean looking on the hotel website. Actually the refurbishment was quite old, so my room was ever so slightly run down. The staff were very helpful and helped me change rooms three times owing to noise from elevators. I would suggest the soundproofing is not very good by modern standards as I could always hear people walking on the floor above my room.

The location is good, just 10 minutes walk into the station. There is a small mall under the hotel with some good places to eat if you don't want to go far. This is vital as room service is massively expensive and over priced.

I find it a bit sad that a once great brand like Hilton charges for wifi and drinking water in its rooms. There is free wifi in the lobby, but the lobby has only two sofas and two chairs, so it's more likely you will leave the hotel for wifi and food.",3,2015/01/11
1,REDACTED,en,1834,"I recently stayed at this property with my family of six during the Christmas holiday. We chose the Hilton based upon the many positive reviews from fellow travelers. We were not disappointed. Getting to the hotel was very easy from the Tokyo Hanaeda Airport. There was the airport limousine service that provided route bus transportation to the Shinjuku area hotels. For the price of 1800 yen we had transport fare and a one day pass for the metro system, worth 1000 yen. The airport bus went directly to the Shinjuku bus station area as well as to the front door of the Hilton. We were greeted immediately by the hotel staff who took our bags and escorted us directly to the check in counter. The process was quick and effortless. We arrived in the early morning with regular check in time at 2 pm. They were able to prepare a room early to place our bags a head of check in time, arrange all three rooms on the same floor, and get us oriented to spend some time exploring the Shinjuku area in short order. One of our rooms on the west wing, north facing offered a great view of the city and Mt. Fuji! The hotel also had a regular shuttle that ran to the Keio Plaza hotel area and bus station area, which could also be easily walked to. If you plan to use the shuttle keep in mind it usually filled quickly. The closest Metro station is the Tochomae Station (E 28) for the Marunouchi Line and Oedo Line that was reachable through the underground shopping complex and walkways that network the area. Above ground and underground walkways also connected you to the neighboring Tokyo Metropolitan Government buildings and to the Shinjuku Metro and Japan Rail station. Although it is a little disorienting trying to figure out directions underground and above grounds, all streets and signs were in both Japanese and English and easily navigated. For those using the Metro subway lines, most fares were between 170 to 220 yen getting from here to other points of interest around Tokyo. For those with the Japan Rail Pass, you have access to the Chuo Line, Yamanote, Tokaido, and Tsurumi line that you can use for local travel as easily as the metro line from the Shinjuku Station, which was about a 15 minute walk through the Shinjuku food and shopping neighborhood. Keep in mind that when using your Japan Rail Pass, you enter and exit stations through the staffed booths rather than the automated gates. The hotel was overall in a great area to access the restaurant and shopping areas of Shinjuku. It is walkable to the Shinjuku Gyoen Park about 20 minutes away and near major shopping destinations. They offer a buffet breakfast for 2100 yen and fine dining. The underground shops of Hiltopia had some dining opportunities, but there were many more in the surrounding neighborhood. We did have a nice Indian food meal at the Ashoka Shinjuku which was a nice change from the Japanese cuisine. Overall, we had a very comfortable stay at the Hilton and found it well located for our travel needs.",5,2015/01/10
1,REDACTED,en,1835,"Very helpful staff, yet some were a little bit amateurish. The second floor restaurant was under renevation so the food selection was quite narrow. Rooms were cozy, despite the bathrooms being below the standard I would expect from Hilton. The location was excellent, good connections to anywhere in or outside Tokyo.",4,2015/01/10
1,REDACTED,en,1836,Good location being near the subway. Also had a free shuttle bus to take you in & out to the main city centre. Staff were very friendly & helpful. Food was excellent. Had New Years Eve there which was good. Also from one side of the restaurant you could get a great view of Mount Fuji on a clear day.,5,2015/01/08
1,REDACTED,en,1837,"This was a week holiday that we always wanted to do a week in Tokyo, arrived to a very busy reception but every one was smiling! We booked two rooms but could not have them side by side , shame.
The rooms are big clean and well maintained!
The lifts are quick and efficient but also very busy,
We loved the hotel and concierge could not be more helpful.
The subway walkway is a god save a brilliant idea, we used it all the time, The hotel is very expensive to eat and drink so we found that all-round are good places to eat very very cheaply (yes in Japan cheap!!!!) and good

overall great stay in a great place can not recommend it enough,
you can walk out of the hotel and reach loads of places or use the underground service the shuttle is good too but when we found that we can walk it in ten minutes we did not bother,It was useful when we had luggage

on the last day we walk to the station and got the narita express to the airport which was all great!

one down side is no free wifi in rooms.",5,2015/01/08
1,REDACTED,en,1838,"I stayed here for work for about a week two years ago in the winter, and it was such a smooth experience that I booked again in January 2015. The rooms are still immaculately clean, new, and with a great view, especially the higher the floor. Breakfast is to die for! This is by far the best breakfast spread I have ever seen. I looked forward to breakfast every morning so I could gorge on well-made Japanese food (although they have American options which are equally good, but of course less exciting). 
Hilton has recently updated their restaurants - they removed the stuffy French restaurant and added these great restaurants and bars on the 2nd floor that flow into one another. Dark lighting with sleek design create a sexy atmosphere - and the live piano and singer doesn't hurt a bit, either. The cocktail I had was way too sweet and the lobster bisque was disappointing, but the sautéed spinach and meat selection at the Metropolitan Grill was fresh and delicious. Expensive! 
Great staff, very flexible and aim to please. And all of them I ran across spoke perfect English. I had some issues with my reservation on hotels.com and they removed a penalty at the front desk within a few minutes. Seamless! 
A train station runs directly under this hotel for added convenience, so if you can manage to find exit C8 from the train station, you will go right up into the lobby of the Hilton. 
This is an impressive hotel, great for business, vacationing, weddings, anything. We plan to book next year as well. 
A short walk from Tokyo's Central Park. Go there if you have a chance! It's beautiful. 
The staff signed me up for Hilton Honors (free) so I could have free wifi in my room. Smart!",5,2015/01/07
1,REDACTED,en,1839,"Great hotel and great location! Check in was fast and straightforward. Staff were always helpful, room was clean and had everything we needed.

Our room had great views and was larger than I thought it was going to be. The staff are just great. Yes the elevators get busy but if that's the only thing you have to worry about in life it cant be that bad. The gym/pool/sauna/spa facilities are great. the perfect way to start and end your day. The buffet breakfast in the morning has everything you could ever think of having for breakfast and even things you hadn't though of. All in all a very pleasant stay. I would definitely go back.",4,2015/01/06
1,REDACTED,en,1844,"Stayed here during Christmas (arrived Christmas Day). Busy hotel and busy lobby but this didn't stop us receiving our first taste of Japanese service. We have a junior suite and we were upgraded to the executive floor which was a lovely touch. Amazing views to Shinjuku, lots of extras in the room and plenty storage space (We stayed for 5 nights so needed the space!). This hotel is in a great location. There is a good, reliable shuttle service to Shinjuku Station but we just walked through the underground and used the metro to get everywhere (Toei Oedo line). This allowed us to explore Tokyo fully. Had breakfast every morning in the Marble Lounge which was great and set us up for the day. Service was excellent and food of a high quality. We also had dinner one night in the Grill restaurant. Excellent service again and the food was outstanding. Lovely wine selection and cocktails. Really enjoyed our first taste of wagyu beef! Overall a wonderful start to our honeymoon in Japan. I would say that maybe an upgrade of the pool area would be in order. The gym looked great as did the changing rooms but the pool looks a little dated. Well done Hilton on a fabulous property. The staff are a real credit to this hotel.",4,2015/01/05

Hotel is located in a more quiet business district, however the hotel is conveniently connected to a subway station and offers a complimentary shuttle service to Shinjuku Station, which has a little bit more life around it. My only complaint about this hotel is the Wi-Fi situation. I stayed in many hotels whilst travelling around Japan, and this was by far the most luxurious and most expensive. It was also the only hotel that didn't offer complimentary in-room Wi-Fi access.",4,2015/01/03

Easy to get to from the airport , we chose the Narita Express however a bus is available as well. A shuttle collects from Shinjinku station and takes you to the hotel. We had 2 rooms on 33rd floor with excellent views of the city. We had a Jnr suite which provided ample room for 2 adults in a King and a 17 yr old in a very good single rollaway. Bathroom was a good size too. Our other room was a King Double which was well appointed too. We made use of the pool and gym facilities and the Japanese Bath area was wonderful as well. Breakfast in the lobby was plentiful and we also enjoyed happy hour in the bar at night. Shinjinku offers great shopping and eating as well. We recommend this hotel highly.",4,2015/01/03

1,REDACTED,en,1848,"Hilton Tokyo was very easy to find and felt at ease the moment we arrived. Our bags were taken from us on arrival and shown to a very friendly check in clerk. Check in was easy, however we didn't realise the room we booked had two single beds and it was our honeymoon. They had no other rooms available so single beds it was, felt very 1950's. We arrived in our room and our bags followed momentarily. The room was really lovely. A large room with a great sized window looking out to the park in Shinjuku. The beds were heaven, pillow top beds which I come to expect from Hilton's. 
We loved their breakfast and never had to wait long for a table. I would however recommend asking for a table in the main area as we were seated on the first morning in St. Georges Lounge and could smell the residual smoke from the previous night. We found the coffee appalling (as with everywhere else in Japan) but realised on our second morning we could order a cafe latte.
Concierge were wonderful and helped us out a lot with maps, underground trains lines to take, reservations at the Hard Rock Cafe and even our bus back to Narita. We never felt like we were a hassle to them.
My only issue is this was the only hotel we had to pay for internet, even in the lobby. We stayed at four hotels in Japan including Hilton Tokyo Bay whom had free wifi in the lobbies and rooms.
I would stay here again for sure. Can never go wrong with a Hilton.",5,2014/12/31
1,REDACTED,en,1849,"I have stayed here because of a package I purchased. It is an ideal place to stay. There are 2 subway stations close by, both within walking distance. The hotel also provides a shuttle service to Shinjuku station which is always on time. The staff has always been friendly and helpful. I will stay here again if I return to Tokyo again! Never a negative experience!",5,2014/12/31
1,REDACTED,en,1850,"The breakfast line for this hotel is always busy. After waiting in line for a while, the hostess (Sandoh) will distribute orange juice for the Japanese customers who are standing in line and skip all the others. I think this is a very unfair treatment. I feel very disappointed to be treated this way and will probably consider staying at other hotels when I visit Tokyo in the future.

1,REDACTED,en,1851,"We booked the hotel through booking.com for a standard room with extra bed for my daughter. To our surprise, when we arrived there we are upgraded to a junior suite hotel and an extra bed was already set-up. What an excellent service! 

Furthermore, I already order to rent portable wifi in a website and the package was already ready in our room when we arrived. Seems like they already think of making your stay comfortable.

The location is also very strategic as it is close to Shinjuku station where it is a big subway & bus station connecting you to other city in japan and there are several tour agency in that station. The hotel also provide free shuttle to/from the station every 30 minutes. Excellent!

The service in the hotel as I said before is really good. I never saw housekeeping around but 
the room are always clean when we returned to the hotel. 

Overall it's value for money as most hotel are expensive in Tokyo. I will stay in this hotel again when I visit Tokyo.",5,2014/12/29

Breakfast is crowded (maybe there was a convention in town or something). Rooms are bland. For the price and location, its ok. Not the best value and not the worst. But as the title of my review says, Tokyo is pretty awesome, so you'll want to go out and explore and not spend it in your room anyway!",3,2014/12/29

Cons: 
The acoustic in the rooms is very poor, we moved twice and it is clearly a building issue no sound proofing, you will need ear plugs. 
Bathrooms are quite small.
You will be charged 1700yen a day to get WiFi in your room, this is clearly not something I would have expected in 2015!",3,2014/12/28
1,REDACTED,en,1855,"During our stay we had the misfortune of two of our family members taken ill with a bad flu. The hotel staff were most helpful in arranging doctors, and an extra late check out on the day of departure.

Paid Wi-fi is a bit pedantic. At these rates, you should have it for free in room.",5,2014/12/28
1,REDACTED,en,1856,"Location:
Hilton was located quite far away from the subway station but they had a shuttle service that was very regular and on time, so that made life a lot easier. 

Room:
The room was well spaced, with a window that overlooks the business area. I thought the window was a nice touch as it allowed natural light into the room. The amenities were great, gentle on the skin and very nicely scented. The beds were comfortable as well, which made it a really good resting place. 

Service:
I was disappointed with their service though. While the staff was polite, it felt very superficial and any further questions that I asked were hardly greeted with smiles. Neither did they volunteer to help or give me more information when I asked questions e.g. how to take a train from Tokyo to Kyoto. They did not, at any point, try to make my stay more pleasant which is quite disappointing because the rest of the hotel was actually pretty good. 

Overall:
I would say that it's a good place to rest your head but for the same price, you can probably get a hotel of the same standard but with better service.",4,2014/12/28

1,REDACTED,en,1858,"This hotel is extremely busy all the time and is full of people all the time . The result is that you queue for breakfast you queue for the executive lounge . And then the endless wait for the elevator . It feels very much like boarding a economy class flight that is packed , not a very pleasant experience . The rooms are small by western standards but I guess not a bad size by Japanese standards . House keeping didn't clean rooms before 1530 each day but the room was very clean and hygienic . There is a nice park near by to walk in and plenty of resturant's near by and easy access to the train system . Getting to hotel is very easy take the limousine bus from Narita and it will drop you right at the door step . Journey will take about 2 hours .",3,2014/12/26
1,REDACTED,en,1859,"Stayed for almost 3 weeks. Hotel is conveniently connected to Nishishinjuku subway station on the main Marunouchi line. Great spacious room with good view, nice modern decor and very comfy bed. Cleanliness 100%. Professional front desk and guest services staff. Concierge was very helpful too. 

However the one big let down to all this pros is the breakfast service at Marble Lounge. Food is OK but the wait staff was very rude. Upon entering we were asked to show our room card holder, quoting room number was not accepted apparently. Was always given the face of indifference whenever we forgot to bring the oh so important card holder. Was even lectured by a waitress that ""Next Time REMEMBER TO BRING IT OKAY"" and a roll of eyes. And worst was the coffee that never came, out of 3 weeks of our stay, 90% of the time we couldnt get our coffee until we have finished our food. Tried to ask several times but the staff was rude as expected and we ended up with cups of duplicate coffee orders.

Gold HHonor doesnt give any much benefit here in terms of services including no priority line for check in. Go to level 37 for check in if you are booked into an executive floor. Free internet for members was good though. Fast and reliable. 

All in all a fantastic hotel in Tokyo if not let down by the breakfast service. Please address.

Our cruise was delayed and our friends had one night at the Hyatt (across the street) and then one night at the Hilton- they liked the Hyatt but loved the Hilton! I suggest the executive level rooms and benefits. Food, location, fitness/spa, $, all good. This hotel made our Tokyo experience unforgettable!",5,2014/12/19
1,REDACTED,en,1861,"I stayed at the Hilton Shinjuku for 5 days on a business trip. The best I can say it is OK. This used to be a great place to stay, but now is just average at best. When I first stayed here about 5 years ago someone would help you with your luggage and take it to your room. As a Diamond member there would be fruit in the room and a room upgrade. The business philosophy has changed over the years. 

It now caters to the large tourist group on the bus. Getting breakfast is a real challenge - fighting your way through the lobby and breakfast line. Most people just push there way in to get the food. They put me in the bar and the staff gave my coffee to the next table. You can see the staff really didn't care.

A decision has been that this location is going after the large tourist off the bus trade and ignore the business traveler. I can understand that they want to maximize the number of rooms sold. Unfortunately, the higher paying business travel is now less important to the management.

I may or may not stay here again. It depends on where my business is. Another words - I may just take it or leave it.",3,2014/12/19
1,REDACTED,en,1862,"Stayed for a night here. While the location is surely a plus, it also has a shuttle to Shinjuku station- which one can use as a hub to explore Tokyo.
The breakfast fare was quite elaborate and extensive- though very crowded as well. As a single guest, I was asked to take up one of the seats on the bar counter to have my breakfast- imagine staring at the array of wine and liquor bottles and have breakfast. Heady!
The surprising thing was the hotel charges extra for wi-fi ( 1700 yen) on top of your room rate. You only have free wifi in the reception/lobby area, where there also is a small business centre with desktops for your surfing use.
The rooms as such had some great views of course, but I was surprised to find the blinds loose and not fitted properly. Don't expect a welcome fruit tray or complimentary drinking water in the room",3,2014/12/18
1,REDACTED,en,1863,"Hotel was located in the business area and to go to the Shinjuku station (this is where the busy area) there's a complimentary bus from hotel to station every 20 minutes. It took about 10-15 mins to walk.

Hotel itself is good but no wow factor. It's more like a hotel catered to business guests.

My score of 5 for cleanliness because I wanted to give it to the housekeeper who had cleaned my room on 15th Dec. I went out since morning for a day trip and I forgot to shut the safe. I had more than $ 3000 in cash and documents. Nothing's taken or touched as I put them in a specific way. Really appreciated the honesty of the staff",3,2014/12/18

1,REDACTED,en,1866,"Regular shuttle bus service to JR Shinjuku station from 0800 until 2130 save the 15 minutes walk. Two subway stations within walking distance via underground passageway from the basement 1 floor of the hotel, Nishishinjuku on the JR Marounochi line and Tochomae on the separate Keio Oedo line. If you get the two day metro subway pass, you can only use the Nishishinjuku station. 

The rooms are nicely decorated and the beds comfortable. The windows are not double glazed so a mild chill can be felt if the shades are open. The aircon/heater in our room wasn't not that efficient so the room was fairly chilly in the morning and this was December. 

One great let down is that the rooms do not have free wifi, except only if you are a Gold HHonors member. Most hotel guests can be found using the free wifi in the small lobby area, making the place rather crowded. In this age of connectivity, for a large hotel like Hilton not to provide free wifi in the rooms is very disappointing. 

There is a decent sized 24 hours Maruetsu supermarket about 2 blocks away from the hotel for fairly reasonably priced fresh fruits and groceries, definitely a better bet than the Quality Store in the basement of the hotel.",4,2014/12/17

Compared to the usual hotels in Tokyo, the Hilton comes across as one which gives a decent feeling of space. The rooms are not the tiny ones found elsewhere in Tokyo (or even Hong Kong) and were well equipped. My room had a great view of the city from its 34th floor and the usual automated commode in the bathroom.
The Hilton service was efficient and non intrusive. Breakfast was an elaborate spread. The shuttle to and fro to the airport was convenient and it was walking distance from the Shinjuku station.",4,2014/12/16
1,REDACTED,en,1869,"We stayed at the Hilton Tokyo for 2 nights in December. We had the junior executive suite on the 18th floor. The room was large, clean and spacious compare to the other shoe boxes hotel I stayed at in Tokyo before. There is even a Nepresso machine in the room. Access to the executive lounge on the 37th floor was available as part of the suite room. We had the buffet breakfast at the executive lounge for both days. The buffet is a mixture of Japanese and western style meal. It was nice but not fantastic. 
The downside I have of Hilton is the location. We had to relay on the Hilton shuttle bus to get to Shinjuku station and back. Also the shuttle bus finishes at 2200hrs. We could walk to the hotel as its about a 15min walk only. However I wouldn't advise you to do that when you're carrying more than 3 shopping bags in each arm or semi-tipsy @ 0200hrs.",4,2014/12/15

1,REDACTED,en,1871,"As you know most of hotel room in tokyo are tiny if located in city. 

I picked Hilton because of their room size seems normal compare to others. 

I have stayed at smoking floor which luckily my room were bigger compare to my friends one because it was in a corner size. My friend's one was newly renovated but not in smoking floor. The other friend's room was old n small. So see how lucky u r to pick the good one.

Very busy hotel to accommodate the guests. 

Breakfast buffet was good especially need to try the eggs as it was so fresh with true egg taste that you hardly can find it nowadays. 

Shuttle bus service was good to commute between hotel and shinjuku station. We lost our way to hotel if we walked in the night time. If shuttle bus service can extend their serving hour till 12am would be good. 

Concierge service - they made some mistake on my package but they did good job to make it up for me and mail it back to my hometown. Many thanks for it. 

Don't take smoking floor if u like to stay in newly renovated room.

Nice, clean room. Staff was very helpful. We stayed on the front and back end of our Japan trip and after 2 different experiences, have to rate the check-in process less than average because both times we had to wait a long time in line and then once we were at the desk it seemed to take longer than usual. Hotel is located in a district near many businesses and government offices. A short walk to the huge Shinjuku station can get you anywhere by Metro and Shibuya (lots of shopping and restaurants0 is not far to walk to either.

2. Poor communication between concierge and reservation department.
3. Poor quality amenities compare to others hotel.

There is a hospital behind.

1,REDACTED,en,1875,"We stayed here at the beginning and end of our 2 week trip to Japan and we absolutely loved it! The hotel is large but the service and hospitality is warm and personal. Check-in and check-out can be a little hectic especially for a non-Japanese speaker but that is only because they go to the trouble to match you with an English speaking agent who then takes their time to explain everything you need to know and answer any questions you have about your reservation or the hotel. They don't rush you and are attentive and hospitable--that takes more time and we truly appreciated it.

I developed a full blown case of the flu on the flight over from the US and the agent worked with the manager to find us a second room and move my room so that the rooms were next to each other so my daughter would not be subjected to my constant cough. 

The concierge desk is fully staffed with several agents all of whom are incredibly helpful and patient. They answer every question no matter how small with care and diligence. We really liked them as well, they were upbeat, cheerful, helpful and warm.

The hotel also has a pharmacy and a convenience store. There is a metro station connected to the hotel. It is a bit of a walk but you are underground and covered so on the rainy days it really was helpful.

The club floor system of this hotel confused me at first and then I LOVED it once I understood how it works. Certain rooms are upgrades to Club Floor but the rooms aren't actually on a club floor. The club lounge is on a high floor and the amenities are extraordinary. Excellent food and open bar with wait staff and self-serve. The views are amazing and every person working there is helpful and hospitable.

Breakfast Buffet-- it was included in our room booking and it was spectacular and completely comprehensive. It is expensive if you pay for it separately but it really started our day off right!

Our experience here was a very warm welcoming start to our trip in Japan.",5,2014/12/10
1,REDACTED,en,1876,"The location, service, views, amenities, and value were all outstanding. I booked this hotel for a small weekend getaway/celebration. I arrived in Tokyo earlier than expected, and the staff quickly prepared a room. When I discovered that the hair dryer was missing in my room, the staff promptly came up with a new one. The views from my room were beautiful. Plus, the room itself was spacious and well kept. The location is close to Shinjuku station. It was also near many restaurants and shopping areas. While there, I had breakfast one morning. There were both Japanese and Western options on the buffet. It was pretty standard but satisfying. Many of the staff are fluent in foreign languages, thus, making it easier for international travelers. For those who live in Japan, there is a small souvenir/omiyage shop in the lobby of the hotel. Overall, I had no complaints about the Hilton. I will definitely be returning for future stays.",5,2014/12/10
1,REDACTED,en,1877,"Stayed here last year at the end of the year. Will stay again this year for 3 nights. Location is good although it is not walking distance from Shinjuku station. We stayed in an executive room and had great breakfasts in the club. Have to have my coffee in the morning but also enjoyed having a variety of things for breakfast in the club. Unfortunately the club was closed for the end of the year and cocktails were available in a ballroom with a million other people and no place to sit. I am hoping that this problem has been resolved this year. Other than that, the rooms are spacious for Tokyo and comfortable. Also like to use the pool. Will be staying here again this year and looking forward to some relaxation time after Christmas.",5,2014/12/09
1,REDACTED,en,1878,"It was a beaufitul hotel. You are minutes from the Shinjuku station which is very convenient. We never walked it because it is a bit of a hike from the station. They do have a shuttle that runs every 15 minutes or so. If you need to get to the station quick,a taxi was only 730 yen which is under $7 american, so we did use that a few times when we had to get there fast. One BIG recommendation is to have a picture of the name of the hotel in Japanese because the cab drivers do not understand English, so I had the name in my phone and would just show it to them when needed. 

It had many shops and restaurants which to be honest we never really went through because we were always on the run 

We did have the buffet breakfast which was really great, It was a little pricey though, with a discount with the room it was $100.00 for 4 people.. yikes. but it was great. There is a McDonalds and Starbucks about a block away(behind) the hotel. 

You are only about 2 blocks from the Metropolitan government building too. they have a free observation deck to be able to see the whole city and even Mt. Fuji on a clear day. Also close to other attractions in the area.

Beds were some of the best I've stayed in. We have 2 adults and 2 teenage kids. most hotels you need to have two rooms because of the size of the rooms and the single beds. We got an executive king bed and they put in two cots for the kids. I was concerned when I hear the word cots, but they were like small twin beds and very comfortable. They also had all the amenities in the bathroom, including a blow dryer. They also provided pajamas, slippers and bathrobes. Room was very big and very nice. They also had an executive lounge which we didn't use because it didn't come with our room for some reason.

One small issue with the bathroom, when you shower, the water goes on the ledge of the bathtub and runs around to a drain so beware, I got my clothes wet the first day. Water does seem to get all over when you shower. 

Again,, very comfortable beds, and heard absolutely no hallway noise or doors slamming. We are planning another trip because we absolutely loved Japan, and will definitely reserve rooms here again. 

Also look into the JR pass. It is good on any of the JR trains, some buses and ferries. It can only be bought in America. They also have a Tokyo east pass which is cheaper but doesn't include the bullet train. It allowed us just to show the pass and jump on the trains anywhere we needed to go, including a 4.5 hour trip to Hiroshima on the Bullet train. 

Japan was really beautiful and clean,, love the people and the culture. I recommend looking on the internet to see where to visit and eat. We did a lot of the local places instead of the touristy places. There are little eateries right behind the Shinjuku station that have tiny alleyways and little eateries inside.
(Omoide Yokocho) 

I originally booked this hotel because it had a pool but we never got to use it, from what I understand there is a surcharge. 

Also, free internet in the lobby but there is a surcharge in the room. At the hotel they do rent wifi devices that aren't very expensive for the week, then just drop in an envelope at the post office at the airport when ready to leave. We didn't use this because we got there too late, but seemed a good deal instead of paying $$ for internet at the hotel.

Concierge was my best friend. lol.. they were so helpful, and so willing to point the way, give maps etc. 

PS... I exchanged yen at the airport and seemed to be a better exchange rate than changing in The states.",5,2014/12/09
1,REDACTED,en,1879,Excellent location; with underground connection to the train station. There is also free shuttle bus to Shinjuku station.

1,REDACTED,en,1880,"We stayed here 2 nights at the tail end of our time in Tokyo after staying at another property, and this hotel was not as good. The property itself is great - good location, short walk to 2 subway stations, starbucks and restaurants nearby, etc. 

We stayed in a jr suite and although the room was large the layout was poor, so it didn't really maximize the space. The bathroom was also quite small, despite the size of the room itself. Breakfast was great - anything you could think of was readily available, including cappuccinos and lattes. 

The concierge was very inconsistent. We would ask for restaurant recommendations, get suggestions from one person, and when we returned to confirm a restaurant another person would say they don't recommend that and give us a whole new list of restaurants. So confusing! This continued with other examples (coin laundry, museums, Shinkansen schedule, etc.), and this detracted from our experience because we lost time and were frustrated at times. So assuming you do not need concierge services, you should have a good experience at this hotel.",3,2014/12/08

Beautiful lobby, good size room with excellent amenities, very nice part of high-end business area of Shinjuku, short walk to Shinjuku station. Very pleasant place to recover from jet lag hangover after flight from US. Hotel easily met or exceeded the Tripadvisor reviews, and was better than similar big city US Hiltons. In fact, all three Hiltons we stayed at in Japan (Tokyo, Osaka, Odawara) were better than US peers, so those used to unpredictable Hilton experience in US should very much enjoy Hiltons in Japan. So, I give this hotel 5 stars partly because of expectations based on busy US hotels in this price range.",5,2014/12/06
1,REDACTED,en,1883,"This is the first time I'm staying here with high occupancy... It's so crowded!! When I checked in a group of airline crew were checking in as well and it's packed near the reception area.. It would be better if a line is set in the lobby for them or some staff are standing in the lobby to smooth the traffic. 
I went out and came back around 6pm, there are LOTS of people waiting for lift as there were functions on 2/F... No one lines up and they just rushed into the lifts... Waited for 3 lifts to get in... Again.. Staff to smooth the traffic during that time or advise those guests to WALK to 2/F is much better as in house guests can't get into the lift at all...
The cocktail hours is a disaster as well...last time I was here I didn't check the cocktail and 5 dec was the first time I went to the lounge... The lounge is all packed and the good running out fast and people are standing for drinks.. Staff at counter were busy to check in... It's not a relaxing place to sit down and drink at all... Huge disappointment..it's just like i was in a market...
One last thing... I loved the quiche from my last visit at the executive lounge. It's sad to find out it's not on the menu anymore even I would like to pay for it... Please consider to have it back to menu.

1,REDACTED,en,1887,There simply isn't anything to complain about. The food at Hilton is really good. Roomservice is excellent.Really friendly staff is something noteworthy. Also noteworthy is the excellent skyview bar on floor 37.,4,2014/12/03
1,REDACTED,en,1888,"This Hilton is unassuming from the outside, but well-appointed from the lobby to the executive lounge. We understand it's common for wifi and breakfast to cost extra, but both came with our executive package at purchase, so ask after this option. The executive lounge has great views and amenities, but is entirely too small. It was standing room only more than once and the staff struggled to meet even basic drink orders at the bar.

Breakfast in the lobby included Japanese-style and Western-style options including egg and smoothie stations. Keep in mind that this hotel asks that guests maintain a business casual dress code and conceal tattoos. Even passing through the lobby in our casual walking clothes made us seem scrubby compared to the other guests. The hotel has an entrance to the subway from the lobby which came in handy during a few rainy days on the week we stayed.",5,2014/12/02
1,REDACTED,en,1889,The hotel felt really clean and modern. It might be a far walk from the Shinjuku station but there is a free shuttle bus. around the corner is the local metro so it's really convenient. Executive Lounge seems pretty modern although it can get filled up at time. The rooms in general were pretty spacious. The staff was helpful although the front desk line can fet pretty long at times.,5,2014/12/02
1,REDACTED,en,1890,"We had the privilege of staying for 8 nights at the Hilton and we were provided first class service from the time we walked in. Staff are very warm and welcoming and always greet you. We had a room on the 27th floor facing the city and view the was spectacular. Housekeeping is superb and room was kept immaculate. The housekeepers do a magnificent job. Our room was spacious and really cannot fault anything. Gym is a bit small but you do not have to pay, as long as a you can do a work out, it serves its purpose. I recommend trying out the new restaurants on the 2nd floor, you will be spoilt. Buffet breakfast can get a bit crowded on weekends but you are placed at your table quickly. Shuttle service is superb, taking you to Shinjuku station and back every 20 minutes. I have to say these shuttle bus drivers do a magnificent job and always great you when you embark and disembark. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone! Will definitely come back to Hilton.",5,2014/11/26
1,REDACTED,en,1891,"Actually this is first time I have stayed at the Hilton for several years. It's gone through an overhaul since my last visit and the rooms are all very modern and clean. I was upgraded to a suite which was very nice with a very large walk in wet-room shower with a very strange small ""sit in"" Japanese style bath tub. I did not get the chance to use any of the eating or drinking options other than the Executive Floor, the breakfast was good and evening happy hour was also very good choice of drinks and snacks if somewhat busy. Everyone of the staff were friendly and attentive.",5,2014/11/26
1,REDACTED,en,1892,"We had a 4-day stay in tokyo and booked the Hilton again like last year.This time we had an executive room (room 3412).Rooms are very luxerious.Best is the view over Tokyo because you stay in the 34th floor.What we loved most is the executive lounge.Here you get a first class service,especially an extrordinary breakfast.Everything is fresh and the buffet is very good serviced by the staff. What we liked was the very professional service all over the hotel as reception,room service and more.A highlight is the inroom ding option.As a guest you should try it.And by the way it is well priced. Result of our stay:The Hilton Shinjuku is an excellent Hotel.

1,REDACTED,en,1893,"The title of the hotel ""Hilton Tokyo"" screams of excitement and wonder, nestled in the centre of one of the busiest and fascination cities of the world. Upon arriving at this busy hub I was greeted by staff who were enjoying themselves, making me feel relaxed and quickly checking me in. The room on the 35th floor was recently renovated and well adorned with a queen size bed (sweetly comfortable), coffee brewer - Japanese style, fully stocked mini bar, excellent bathroom, and amazing toilet with more apps that an iPhone The fully fitted gym was very however still managed to jump on the running machine without too mush trouble. Dining in Tokyo is a mazing with over 100,000 eateries scattered throughout the metropolitan areas so hotel dining needs to excel and Tokyo Hilton is know exception. The breakfast dining was great value for money, an exceptional array of both traditional and wester cuisines, fresh cut fruits, juices and smoothies and a suitable egg station with the chefs turning over 500 omelettes and another 500 serves of freshly cooked eggs during the breakfast rush. The restaurant precinct on the 2nd floor recently renovated and reopened on the 31st October 2014 was amazing. High quality sushi and traditional Japanese cuisine, authentic Chinese cuisine, cocktail bar but my favourite was the originality of the grill restaurant with the circular wood fired and charcoal grill surrounded by an amazing meat chest of ageing prime cuts of the world finest beef. Overall a very good experience in beautiful city. Peter Wright",4,2014/11/25

We had a bit of problem with the wifi but it was fixed quickly. The suite was nice and spacious with great view. Bathroom is small but smartly designed. The bed was very comfortable. There's a subway entrance right across the street. There are also a few good options for dinning in the nearby buildings.",5,2014/11/23
1,REDACTED,en,1896,"Due to heavy rain and bad traffic, the bus ride to the hotel was three hours (normally 1.5hrs). I would recommend train ride instead. 

Stayed in an Executive room, got to enjoy drinks and snacks in the executive lounge upon arrival. They served a great variety of drinks at happy hour and different types of canapes. It was populated at happy hour time, but you don't feel crowed or congested. Good to relax and use the wifi there. 

Breakfast was served in the same lounge. Nice coffee and tea selection. Very delicious freshly-squeezed orange juice. A good variety of western and Japanese breakfast. 

Room was well-maintained and very clean, large enough but not spacious. It was well-equipped with all necessary gadgets. Very comfortable bed and pillows! The only downer is room wifi was unreliable. It was down the whole night I stayed there.",4,2014/11/23
1,REDACTED,en,1897,"Stayed here for 3 nights in November in an Executive room.
The room, like most in Tokyo are fairly small but acceptable. Rooms were clean, curtain shades did a great job of shielding the light.

The door to the shower can be a challenge for those above average size.
The lounge on 37/F floor is ok with free flow of alcohol but the food was limited.
The breakfast on G/F was much better.

There is a shuttle that run 3 times an hour to Shinjuku station.",4,2014/11/20
1,REDACTED,en,1898,"Very good hotel. Rooms are large enough and could fit all 5 of us (3 adults and 2 kids sharing beds) with an additional bed. Location is excellent with the Tokyo Metro station close by and shuttle bus service to Shinjuku Station. It is also the first pick up point for the Airport limousine bus that takes you to Narita which makes our departure to the airport so convenient especially with 2 small kids.

The only setback for us was that the restaurants were being renovated when we were there and on our last night, when Tokyo was hit by a typhoon, we had no choice but to eat at the make shift restaurant which was very expensive and not great. 

Apart from that, everything else was excellent. the staff were very friendly and very helpful. Would definitely come back.",4,2014/11/19
1,REDACTED,en,1899,"Flying to Tokyo from the States is a long hard trip. Getting to the Hilton after a two hour bus ride through the heavy evening traffic was a relief. Just making it to the Executive Lounge in time for last call on drinks and snacks was great. This hotel became our oasis of pampering in the hectic city of Tokyo. Rooms were modern and large. Breakfast in the Marble Court was an event in itself. The hotel is run efficiently and yet the staff was very friendly. The shuttle to the train station is reliable and quick. All in all a top place to stay, especially for Hilton Honors elite members.",5,2014/11/19
1,REDACTED,en,1900,Clean & Comfortable! Great location. I stayed at the Hilton during a recent business trip. It is in the heart of Tokyo and was easy to commute by train to any location. Very helpful staff and excellent restaurants. I can easily recommend this hotel for business or pleasure in Tokyo.,4,2014/11/19
1,REDACTED,en,1901,"I stay in Hilton for business trip, location wise the hotel is quite far from Shinjuku station but they provide shuttle bus 20 mins once, overall still ok. walking will take about 15 mins from shinjuku station to the hotel. The last shuttle from shinjuku station to hotel is around 9pm, so please take note, if you are late, you might need to walk or take cab back. 

Hotel room is spacious and feeling good with the traditional japanese window design, overall the hotel room make you feel comfortable ! I enjoy the room very much. 
Room come with wifi. 

One draw back is the receptions always take very long time, customer need to queue up and wait for 10 mins more to wait for their turn, they do not have enough man power at the reception for check in and check out. 

overall service level is ok. 
The concergie help me to purchase ticket too, really grateful for their help.",5,2014/11/19
1,REDACTED,en,1902,"We stayed in the Junior Executive Suite for four nights and appreciated that the room was so spacious and open. Service was great from the moment we stepped out of our taxi on arrival. 
Pros:
- Large hotel room with a large lounge, natural lighting, working desk etc
- Great views from our hotel windows
- Friendly/attentive staff who always helped us with our luggage, general queries (English wasn't an issue)
- Convenient shuttle bus service to the station - Bus was always 100% punctual! Bus driver was incredibly friendly when he insisted on helping us with all of our luggage when he dropped us off at the station 
- Free wifi was available in the lobby area

Cons:
- Hotel location wasn't as central, however the shuttle bus service was available and became quite useful
- Hotel was very busy causing slower lifts/elevators, crowded lobby, hectic buffet breakfast (service was slow)
- Buffet breakfast was great however got boring after 2 days - it would be better with alternating menus and/or more Japanese cuisine. 

Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Hotel Tokyo and would recommend this hotel room for travellers who appreciate space, quality amenities, cleanliness and service.

1,REDACTED,en,1906,"My travel agent booked me into this hotel by accident. I was supposed to be in the Conrad, and instead ended up here. HUGE mistake. 

The service here was fine. Not as professional or as proficient as the Conrad, but acceptable. The room was nothing special either. Okay size, rather outdated, but acceptable.

The problem is that this hotel is not equipped to handle a full capacity, much less a half capacity guest population. Check in took over 20 minutes with a huge line. Every trip up or down the elevator was an ordeal, stopping on every single floor and people crammed in like a subway at rush hour. The breakfast felt like a scramble for everything.

In short, if you book here, hope and pray that the hotel is at 10-20% capacity, because that seems to be the amount they can handle without falling apart at the seams.",2,2014/11/15
1,REDACTED,en,1907,"Easily accessible by subway, on foot or by their shuttle bus from the Shinjuku station, the hotel room was large, nicely appointed and had a great view. Both the room itself and the bathroom were clean and modern. We had a few hiccups at check in but nothing serious. We really liked this hotel, but they did not provide free wifi unless you went to the lobby. The hotel rate was expensive and so was the daily wifi charge. After a long day of touring you just want to access the internet in the comfort of your room. Lobby seats were at a premium as many patrons seemed to be surfing the net - no excuse for it not to be included especially at these daily hotel rates.",4,2014/11/15
1,REDACTED,en,1908,"This hotel is huge, if you need any proof just look at the enormous breakfast room - yet it never really felt crowded. The staff were helpful and pleasant and the location was decent - about 20 minutes stroll to Shinjuku station - one of the biggest in the world. 

I stayed last time at the Park Hyatt Tokyo which was hard to beat - but Hilton came close! 
I would stay at the Hilton Tokyo again!",5,2014/11/14
1,REDACTED,en,1909,"This is a traditional Hilton hotel. Jim Carrey said all hotels in the world are the same. We stayed here for two nights with the next morning taking a tour to Mount Fuji. The staff was nice. I loved the breakfast buffet. The view was great. The hotel room was clean and beautiful and washrooms/toilets were great.

You can't bash this four star hotel. Cost like $275 US per night with breakfast. Which is a lot. I went to Vietnam a week after and the prices were significantly less pricey. This hotel is in the heart of Shinjuku. It's a nice place like many four star hotels. I really don't know what else to say.

They take your credit card details if you paid by PayPal in advance just in case you damage anything. Oh.. Wi-Fi costs extra, which is weird, since you're paying that much. That didn't matter too much for us because we purchased pocket Wi-Fi. I think it would be better for the guests if they had pocket Wi-Fi, but I'm nitpicking. Nice TV, nice room, nice room service. You can't fault the Hilton. So five star rating. Tokyo is awesome :)",5,2014/11/14

Breakfast had many different choises with good quality food. Did not eat in hotel restaurants for lunch or dinner. There was a metro station pretty much under the hotel, made moving around Tokyo quite easy. Huge city but the metro system helps alot.

1,REDACTED,en,1918,"Stayed at many Hilton hotels over the years, This is one of the best in terms of service. Some great staff, particularly in the Executive Lounge. However need to sort out the bottle neck at check-in. Although a little distance from the city centre it has great transport links.",4,2014/11/07
1,REDACTED,en,1919,"I will preface this review by stating that I am a dedicated Hilton patron.

There is a great deal of satisfaction in seeing a large property so well accommodating and guests never once feeling rushed. Beautiful and classy lobby - large scale and contemporary with a welcoming staff. Check in for our two rooms was a breeze and as I specifically requested queen size beds (I was paying with currency plus Hilton Honors Points), that is exactly what we received and on the same floor, a few doors down. The rooms were very spacious and up to date in design - nice lighting and more than comfortable.

Where these were not on the Executive level, the Executive lounge for breakfast was an amazing buffet with some table services on the top floor.

The location is in the 'skyscraper district' a 10 minute leisurely walk at most from the crazy and endless Shinjuku station. We always try to stay near the station given the junction of so many train lines and the Yamanote Ring line. It really becomes quite convenient.

The fitness center is complete with spa facilities, that I did not use, but the gym was Hilton worthy with a very nice pool.

One morning we decided to eat our breakfast in the lobby restaurant which was so well managed given the tremendous number of guests. The staff needed to accommodate more guests so they started seating in the lounge area - never compromising attention to our needs.

Even as a solo traveler, I would absolutely repeat my stay here in spite of my decade long Hilton Honors status. It is a great property.",5,2014/11/06
1,REDACTED,en,1920,"The Tokyo Hilton is all the best that Hilton has to offer. Service is attentive, rooms perfectly clean and well appointed. Hilton have made an effort over the years to have great breakfasts and the Tokyo Hilton is no exception. The gym is small but well appointed; the pool is wonderful (and no charge which is unusual for Japan). For those not used to the Japanese Sento or public bath experience, then the small one in the pool area is a great start.

Downside is location. The hotel shuttle is 3 times an hour to Shinjuku. The only sightseeing in the immediate area is the Tokyo Metropolitan Government (which is well worth it - meet a free English guide in the reception). There are Tokyo Metro trains attached to the hotel but the underground walk must be 1 km.

I would stay there again but consider other options.",4,2014/11/06
1,REDACTED,en,1921,"We were very pleased because we were on one of the executive floors and could take advantage of the freshly squeezed orange juice in the mornings and the amazing spread with drinks late afternoon. The location isn't great, and we had a hard time getting everything from our suitcases that we needed for five days into the little spaces provided. The bed is comfortable, but the pillows are way too large. There seems to be a lot of businessmen and business women staying here. The mornings is like grand central station with flags and bus loads of people checking out and going on tour. I will have to say that a bus is provided every 20 minutes from the hotel to a central location, where you can shop, walk or take the subway.",4,2014/11/06
1,REDACTED,en,1922,"Stayed here for 4 nights altogether when I visited Tokyo. The renovated king deluxe room that I stayed in was excellent: clean, modern, spacious by Japanese standard, a nice touch of Japanese culture with the paper windows. 

The staffs were friendly and helpful as with 99% of the hotel staffs in Japan. Check in was smooth and efficient. 

The luggage delivery service downstairs near the concierge was also something I was really impressed with. we sent our 20kgs luggage through Hilton to the hotel in Kyoto for 2000 yen. The most well spent 2000 yen ever saving us the hassle of dragging the luggages everywhere. 

Location wise, it's not the best location as it's located in west shinjuku, about 30 mins walk from shinjuku station and 10 mins walk from nishishinjuku station. For me it's ok as I didn't have tight schedule, but for other people with massive luggages and need to get around much it could be quite a hassle, especially during peak hour or on a rainy day. However they do have the shuttle service to and fro shinjuku station if you don't like too much walking. 

A slight dissatisfaction from me would be the absence of free drinking bottled water. Not sure if it's because of the fact that I booked through a third party agent or it's just the norm of this hotel. 

All in all, it's still the luxurious Hilton hotel that we have always known. Will definitely stay here again the next time I am here.",4,2014/11/05
1,REDACTED,en,1923,"Spent a total of 7 nights at Hilton Tokyo in October. 

It was a great stay. Had a room upgrade via Hilton Hhonors hence had access to the lounge. Internet was also bundled in. Otherwise I would be rather irritated to have to pay for internet in the room so might want to take note of this if access is important.

The hotel is located between two metro lines. I used mainly the metros and the free shuttle (love the shuttle) It is not as punctual as transport usually is in Japan but it does not bother me. The travellators that lead to the metro station are not in operation. I am not sure if its this way all year round. So although the hotel is not located right in the hub of touristy things, it is easy to get to Shinjuku or any other part of central Tokyo.

The room itself was great. Beds were comfortable. They were also generous with toiletries. 

Lastly I wish to lavish great praise on their concierge service. They helped with restaurant reservations/directions and could speak impeccable english. In fact you can email them for assistance from the time you confirm your reservation for all your needs and requests.

Also the hotel drop off is one of the stops for the airport limo bus from Haneda and Narita which makes it very convenient. 

A very good stay. Will be heading back again next week for a shorter stay. Looking forward.",5,2014/11/05

We will stay there again if traveling to Japan.",4,2014/11/05
1,REDACTED,en,1925,"This is a nice hotel, well-decorated and lots of facilities. The location isn't great, I think it's more for business travellers visiting local companies: it's on a couple of transit lines which will get you anywhere in Tokyo, but there's nothing really close by (except for a bit of Shinjuku's bright lights, 10/15 minutes walk away). I would say it's over-priced for what you get, especially since everything has an extra charge, e.g. wi-fi and water, so only book if you get a good deal. I stayed for $100/night with a corporate account, which is excellent value for Tokyo. I would say up to $150 is reasonable for this place.",3,2014/11/03
1,REDACTED,en,1926,"We stayed in this hotel with two children aged 4 and 7. We upgraded to an executive floor and had the most amazing family room with spectacular views across the city. Very spacious and comfortable with excellent facilities. I loved the glass bathroom! Like all Japanese hotels I have stayed in there was no need for toiletries as they were provided including razors and toothbrush. A nightgown was also provided. The beds were extremely comfotable and the air on in the room well controlled. 

The executive lounge was super, with soft drinks and snacks all day, afternoon tea and pre dinner canapés and cocktails in the evening. The children had a particular liking for the chocolate milk. We were also able to borrow DVDs to watch in our room through our access to this lounge. We were so pleased that we had upgraded. The staff were so helpful and even booked a Karaoke for us and wrote down the details in Japanese for us to hand in when we arrived there. We preferred breakfast in here to the restaurant. 

The location was ideal for public transport with a metro station under the hotel. The hotel provided a bus every 20 minutes to Shinjuku station which was just over a 5 minute journey. In Shinjuku we we visited the Robot Restaurant (good fun), karaoke and an amazing BBQ restaurant. We used the metro to travel to Yoyogi Park and The Skytree. 

I would love to stay here again!",5,2014/11/03

Breakfast, Wi-fi, and all day drinks (water, sodas, coffee/tea) and snacks included in room rate. We really enjoyed the cocktail hour hosted in the lounge. Wonderful selection of snacks and beer/wine/cocktails made for the perfect nightcap after a day of sightseeing in Tokyo. Restaurants were under renovation when we went but should be open now. The new dining concept on the second floor looked really neat and will definitely be a big hit with business travelers.

The room was modern, clean, and comfortable and we had access to the executive lounge which offered light snacks and drinks. Our room looked like it had been recently renovated. Well worth the price! The breakfast buffet was also great, with tons of options. The hotel also has a shuttle to the Shinjuku station about every 20 minutes; however, it is only a 15 minute walk to the hotel. We preferred to take the subway from Shinjuku Nishi station (it's closer to the hotel) because it was way less chaotic than the Shinjuku station.

1,REDACTED,en,1931,"My husband and I visit Tokyo 4-5 times a year. When hotel rates for both hotels are close, we prefer the Conrad. However, we booked the Hilton Shinjuku for the first time this year. It was a lovely experience to be back as we were made to feel vey welcomed by the staff, especially Mr. Yota Ogura, the front desk manager. He went out of his way to make our stay a memorable one. We had called ahead to request an extra bed for our daughter. He was most thoughtful and kind in offering us a different suite from the one we had booked so she could have some privacy as the doors to the living area could be closed. This was truly appreciated as she was ill with the flu upon arrival to Tokyo and could spend the next two days sleeping in,undisturbed by us.The staff provided superlative assistance with directions, restaurant reservations and a last minute forwarding of a parcel to our next destination in Japan. Without the help of the concierge, we could not have managed to address,pack and tape up a box and pay for the postage given the time constraint we had ( 20 mins).
There is a direct airport limousine bus to the Hilton immediately outside the Narita arrival area. I would recommend this service outside of rush hour only as it once took us 3 hours to get to the hotel. For this trip, as we arrived at 5pm, we took the Narita Express train directly to Shinjuku( 1hr 15 mins ), walked about 5 mins to the West exit to Keio department store where we caught the Hilton transfer bus to the hotel ( about 1 hr 45 mins ). The train system is quite a complicated experience for first timers. The bus is a whole lot simpler.

The only negative comment about the Hilton Shinjuku is that the executive lounge is always very full and would require a wait time to get a table.",4,2014/11/02
1,REDACTED,en,1932,"I stayed for 4 nights at Hilton hotel in Tokyo and I found the hotel quite ok for its standards, rooms were roomy and clean, gym was good, wellness area a bit old but still acceptable, restaurant area was brand new and I had dinner in the steak house. Great food and great service, maybe just s little slow.
Location was also good.
What was absolutely below the standards was the bar in the lobby. I had the worst club sandwich of my life and when I offered a late beer to my boss in the bar I had the wake up three times for my chair because waiters were not looking at us at all! Their English was also very poor so that asking for a booze and a beer was almost an experience. 
In general a positive experience, but not acceptable that a Hilton of this level has such a poor bar area.

1,REDACTED,en,1933,"I am a HHonors Diamond member, Marriott Platinum and Intercontinental platinum member. Usually spend about 250+ days on road. I have stayed at other hotels in Tokyo, and can definitely say Hilton offers the best service and value for price for business travelers among all the major international hotel chains here. The staff goes above and beyond in rendering quality service. There was never once an occasion where the staff was not friendly or did not attempt to meet my requests. Special mention to Akima-san in sales and Wada-san in breakfast service who truly make the experience memorable. The executive lounge not only has all the amenities usually desired by business travelers but also has an extremely attentive and helpful staff. The only issue I have faced during my stay is that on some occasions the room internet connection has been a bit patchy especially for mobile connections. Other than that minor glitch, the stay is usually exceptional.",5,2014/11/02
1,REDACTED,en,1934,"Whenever I come to Tokyo, this hotel is my first choice and we do come at least twice a year. Hilton Tokyo still offers one of the best accommodation for frequent business traveller. It is a little out of the way on the west side of shinjuku and not much of a nightlife, but there is easy underground access to 2 subway stations. This October visit, the room was a bit tired and dated. There was no desk to work from and amenities I have received in the prior statys was not provided even though I am a Diamond member. 

Although this last visit was not one of the best experience I have had with the staff and hotel, Hilton still offers proper sized hotel rooms and delivers efficient and friendly service. The executive lounge is a respite for travelers with its friendly staff and food option, one the many reasons why I am loyal to Hilton chain. Although food selection has downgraded slightly in Marble Lounge and Executive lounge compared to past years it still offers a vast selection for breakfast, cocktail and dinner. 

We were fortunate to be invited to the successful launch of Tsunohazu, where the entire second floor was transformed to an open and sophisticated areas for japanese, chinese, bar and Steak restaurants. We dined at the Metropolitan Grill on launch nite and had a great experience. They need to iron out a few kinks but Philippe and his staff were very accommodating and receptive to feedback. We plan to check the japanese restaurant next.",4,2014/11/01

A little out of the way on the west side of shinjuku (The restaurant/nightlife area is the other side of the station). Easy underground access to 2 subway stations make it easy to get to whatever area you are conducting business. And still proper sized hotel rooms, which is great compared to the shoeboxes of many of the ""Business Hotels"" the locals stay in when they have to come to Tokyo.",4,2014/10/31
1,REDACTED,en,1937,We stayed for one night at the end of our cruise from China to Japan. I chose the hotel based on excellent reviews. We arrived at 10.30am and there were long lines to check in so it was obviously a busy time but a member of staff handed out glasses of juice which was a nice gesture. We were able to use the computer in their Business Lounge to do our flight check in and print the boarding passes at no charge which we were very impressed with. The shuttle bus is very helpful but it's not too far to walk to the main area of Shinjuku. We had a great evening eating in the local restaurants - sampling different Japanese food. We had a drink in the English pub in the hotel later in the evening and were surprised that there was no dedicated non-smoking area in the bar. I appreciate cultures are different but I don't think it would be difficult to section an area. Overall very pleased with hotel.,5,2014/10/31

We will stay there again next time we are in Japan.",5,2014/10/29
1,REDACTED,en,1942,Have to say not a fan of Hilton and the big brand hotels but this hotel did deliver in spades. Had a club level room. Room was perfectly appointed with water pressure like no other. Ahhh I will miss the showers. Staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. Pool/Spa area was the usual very high standard for Asia. Club level was worth the money as you can have breakfast in the lounge or in the main dining room. Evening service in the club lounge is a slick affair and once again the staff could not be more attentive or friendly. I would also add that the hotel is spotless and the housekeeping should be commended for this.,5,2014/10/29

When we checked in we automatically got upgraded room to junior suite which was great however all staffs work in this location need to be a bit friendly. Compared to Hilton Osaka, Hilton Tokyo is a average overall. When we were waiting to catch a shuttle to International airport back to USA, I plug my IPHONE at the lobby, just like other guy(non Japanese) at the lobby. I was the only one informed by a staff to unplug my phone, spoke in Japanese. Hilton Osaka, we shipped our big luggages to Hilton Tokyo because we stopped in Kyoto on the way to Tokyo that we did not want to deal with luggages. At Hilton Osaka, they offered to fill out the forms. We felt they did beyond their duties to please us. We did not feel the same way at Hilton Tokyo. Hilton Tokyo was the average compared to other Hilton we have stayed US & foreign countries.",3,2014/10/28

1,REDACTED,en,1945,"This is written by a diamond hilton member. so automatic lounge access and generally upgraded rooms. The room we were upgraded into was incredible. a executive suite on the 38th floor, absolutely marvelous... zero complaints. The staff were helpful, there was nothing negative except the executive lounge which was a zoo, unpleasant, loud, full of folks stuffing themselves lining up 3 glasses of wine before the end of happy hour. ugh!!! The breakfast in the lounge was adequate, but the breakfast in the dining room was outstanding. My advice.. go downstairs for breakfast, and pay for your drinks in either the new just opened bar on the 2nd floor or go to the older, very 80's hilton bar on ground floor.. the misery of the lounge is just not worth it. This being said it is a great hotel. getting to the Airport is a snip on the bus which runs about every 50 minutes, takes a conservative 2 hours, but is commonly quicker. Its an easy walk to the subway and shinjuku station. Not much open wrt to restaurants in the immediate area on a sunday night, otherwise a great hotel in a great location",4,2014/10/27
1,REDACTED,en,1946,"Hilton Tokyo was great! I highly recommended it. Staff was so courteous, on time, things were tidy, clean. It has all the Hilton Brand promises to deliver, very business oriented. Shuttle service to Shijuku station was very helpful. It also scores extra points that the airport limousine shuttle stops right in front - as that commute from Narita to Tokyo is a looonng ride. Cannot ask for more. Pool was adequate, gym was adequate but could be more spacious ... felt crammed. Breakfast buffet was fairly basic - can improve on the variety. We were there for 6 mornings and thought we ran out of stuff to eat. But overall it's a great hotel, SPACIOUS rooms you can't get any where in Tokyo for the price, comfy beds, great location. I am very happy with my stay. We also got upgraded as a surprise to a suite.",5,2014/10/27
1,REDACTED,en,1947,"I had to do a fairly short 3 1/2 day business trip to Tokyo, and the hotel closest to my company office was not available so I went with the tried and trusted Hilton. Checking was super quick and the staff extremely good and friendly. Unfortunately due to renovations most of the restaurants were closed, but not really that big a problem as it is are for me to actually eat at the hotels on a business trip, either room service whilst working or being taken out by the locals.

The hotel is excellent location with subway directly accessible from Hotel, or a free shuttle to the nearby major station of Shinjuku.

As this was my first trip to Tokyo in 15 years, not much else to compare with, but was certainly comfortable and I got a good nights sleep every night, and would not hesitate in staying here again.",5,2014/10/26

Although I booked an average room and hoped we may be able to check in a bit earlier after an all flight from Australia we took up an offer to upgrade so that we went into our room at about 8am. The upgrade included a level 38 executive room with access to the lounge for breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks.

What a thrill to see Tokyo laid out before us from our beautiful room! 

Staff were friendly, helpful and the service was faultless. For us the upgrade cost was well worth it considering the early check in and all the executive benefits. The hotel has been recently renovated so beds, furnishings and facilities were top class. The hotel is in a good position for business and holidaymakers.",4,2014/10/26

1,REDACTED,en,1950,"Tokyo Hilton represents, to me, Hilton at its very best. I haven't stayed here in several years and was impressed with the improvements. Realistically, as a frequent traveler, I don't expect a hotel to be flawless, but my stay here was perfect in every way.

The hotel is an easy, interesting ten minute walk from Shinjuku station if you don't want to wait for the shuttle.

Check in was fast, efficient and friendly. Considering the size of this hotel that is an achievement in and of itself.

The Executive Suite I reserved was spacious, comfortable, meticulously clean, quiet, and had every amenity imaginable. The bed was especially comfortable. The air handling system was quiet, responsive and seemed to provide fresh, clean air. I know some of these attributes may seem basic, but it is surprising to me how many hotels these days are lacking in some of these areas.

We had breakfast in the dining area off of the main lobby. The food was fresh, the selection could accommodate most any special diet, and the service was helpful and responsive.

When it came time to check out, I was sorry I had not booked a longer stay; it was so comfortable here! But the check-out process was fast and easy.

The next time I stay in Tokyo, it will be at the Tokyo Hilton. This is a model of competence, service and efficiency every hotel should emulate.",5,2014/10/25

Considering the price of the room, in-room WIFI us not free. WIFI is complimentary at the lobby but connection was not the best. Go to a Starbucks across the street if you need to use the internet. Gym was small and amenities were basic. If you want to use it early in the morning, don't bother going (it can get crowded). If you need to use the bathroom at the locker room, you are required to take off your shoes wear slippers. The hotel should look at this again because of the inconvenience.

If it's raining and forgot your umbrella, the concierge will be happy to lend you one (just leave your card key).",5,2014/10/25

1,REDACTED,en,1953,"We stayed at the Hilton Tokyo for 6 nights in September. On arrival we were offered an upgrade to an executive room which we gladly took. The room had a separate bedroom with rollaway beds in the lounge area for the kids. The room was large and comfortable for the length of stay. We had a great view of Tokyo and could see Mt Fuji on a clear day! The executive lounge was awesome and, because we were travelling with kids, it was nice to have snacks available pretty much all day.

The staff were amazing and helped us with everything from finding medication to finding a laundromat. All staff spoke English which is pretty amazing and something we didn't encounter at any of the other hotels we stayed at (except for Hilton Tokyo Bay). The poor concierge desk were kept busy just writing things down in Japanese for us so we could get directions if we needed. They also arranged for our luggage to be forwarded to Hilton Tokyo Bay on our departure so that we didn't have to lug it to Kyoto and back. The shuttle bus was great and made getting to and from the station really easy.

The hotel has a small shopping centre underneath with a 24 hour convenience store and an international ATM. There are plenty of grocery stores, a pharmacy and food outlets within easy walking distance. Denny's is across the road, Starbucks a 3 minute walk and McDonald's a 5 minute walk (handy for fussy eaters).

1,REDACTED,en,1956,"Prior to a conference at Chiba, My wife and I had a 2-night stay at Hilton Tokyo Hotel at Shinjuku district between Oct 17 and 19, 2014. We took the Airport Limousine Bus Service from Haneda Airport directly to the hotel. 

The service from the front desk was first class. As my wife is a member of Hilton chain, the lady manager gave us a free upgrade to an executive room. The executive room is not particular large but is quite comfortable in size. The interior decoration and design are contemporary. Bathtub and shower area are separated. As it was a free upgrade, free in-room Wi-Fi was not available. There is free WiFi service in the lobby. However, the signal is not very strong and the bandwidth is limited.

Buffet breakfast, included in my airline vacation package, was very good with a juice bar serving free juice and ice cappuccino. 

The hotel is close to two subway stations: 350m/4min. from Nishi-Shinjuku Station (M07) on the Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line, and 550m/7min. from Tochōmae Station (E28) on the Toei Ōedo Line. Both stations could be reached by underground passage so that you won’t get lost on the street. However, the two lines are operated by two separate companies. If you want to buy a 1- to 3- days subway tickets, you should buy Tokyo Subway Ticket. Do not buy the cheaper Tokyo Metro Open Ticket, as it is only valid for the Tokyo Metro Lines and not valid for Toei Lines. The underground passage does not bi-directional escalators, however. It will be relative difficult to carry heavy luggage from Hotel to the stations, especially to the Tochōmae Station. 

There is no nearby shopping area. You can take a free shuttle bus to the Takashimaya department store near the Shinjuku station.",5,2014/10/19
1,REDACTED,en,1957,"Just to comment on a previous post wifi is free if you are paid for the executive package. The executive package includes free wifi, free breakfast in the marble lounge (which includes a lot more variety) goes from 6:30am to 10:30 am or you can have a light breakfast on the 37th floor in the executive lounge from 6 am to 10 am each morning. In addition, executive package allows you access to tea time with light snacks on the 37th floor from 3 pm - 5 pm. Also there is pre-dinner drinks for free and also there are snacks throughout the day in the executive lounge until 8 pm. For people who wants a quiet place to relax and enjoy the view the executive package is the way to go. 

The hotel is situated 1 hour from narita airport or 45 minutes from haneda airport. However, it is really easy to get to the hotel using the airport limousine bus service. It takes you straight to the hotel. If you are arriving late and miss the airport limousine bus service to Hilton Tokyo you can always take the bus going to Hyatt. The hotels are right across from each other. I would suggest taking this if you want to save a little bit of money. It cost approximately Canadian $13 per person. Street taxi will cost you about $300. Hotel taxi about $100. 

The breakfast in the marble lounge was great. Had smoked salmon every morning. There is a variety of ethnic food. Tea time was great a lot of different snacks. It was good to relax when it was raining outside.

The hotel offers shuttle service to shinjuku station till about 9 pm at night. The shuttle comes every 20 minutes and it will pick you up from shinjuku station and bring you back from the hotel also. Great service. If you want to walk it is about a 12-15 minutes from the hotel to shinjuku station.

The room was a great size and the bathroom was spacious with heated bathroom seats. My room was quiet. 

The beds were comfortable and the room was cleaned daily nicely. 

There is fitness center and pool at the hotel.

The only negative aspect I would mention is the waiting area in the lobby did not have enough chairs.",5,2014/10/18

Most of the hotel restaurants are under renovation so dining is limited, and is has put further pressure on the lounge. One area of particular difficulty is finding somewhere to sit in the hotel lobby, no extra chairs seem to have been provided and the usual lounge area is busy with diners. The staff were happy to accommodate us in the lounge area when we asked, but there is room, and certainly demand for more. 
The newly refurbished restaurants open soon and that will probably solve the problem anyway.

The room and bathroom were good. The groundfloor bar design and decor needs some fresh thinking, looks tired, but the jazz was very nice. Had the most expensive Guiness I have had worldwide here. The second floor restaurants were all closed for remodeling. Location and courtesy bus to the station was very convenient. All trains and subway very easy to use in Tokyo.

1,REDACTED,en,1963,"Returned to Hilton Tokyo for the first time as a Hilton Gold member. Arrived after my red-eye flight from Hong Kong early in the morning and was checked-in promptly by very friendly Ms Kato at the front desk. Was promptly upgraded to an Executive room that has been refurbished and although the room is not ready for another 2-3 hours, we were welcomed to utilise the executive lounge until the room was ready. Breakfast on offer at the executive lounge and the hotel restaurant were of exceptionally great quality. 

Only downside was when we were trying to access the executive lounge on the Sunday evening for drinks and canapés - arrived at the lounge but was advised that the lounge is overcrowded with a waiting list of over 12 tables before we will be called! At this point we did not think it was worth the wait and decided not to proceed. While this was disappointing, it was fine for us as we were provided the benefit as part of the Hilton Gold status. Should I have paid for an executive room and not being able to access the lounge this would have been extremely annoying, and this seem to be what the hotel would need to work on.

Rooms at oversized for Tokyo standards and is well appointed and furnished. Room has been recently refurbished and is contemporary. Service is great as usual in Japan and nothing to fault.

Hotel is located at a good location in Shinjuku, approx 10-15 minutes walk from JR station and a few minutes walk from several Tokyo Metro/subway stations. Hotel offers a shuttle bus (3 per hour) between Shinjuku station West exit and the hotel. 

Overall a great stay at the hotel as usual and this remains as one of my favourites despite the minor incident at the executive lounge at evening drinks.",4,2014/10/12
1,REDACTED,en,1964,"We visited Tokyo in April this year for a family holiday to celebrate my sisters 21st and stayed in the Hilton for 7 nights before moving onto Disneyland Tokyo.

I must say that I have never been impressed with any of the Hilton's hotels I've stayed in before as the ones in the UK are often quite tired and dated. However, this is Tokyo and everything is bigger and better.

The hotel itself is stunning with superb facilities including a brilliant executive lounge which did great nibbles and cocktails in the evening. The suites were huge with all mod cons including a nespresso machine, giant TV's and power showers. The staff were all extremely friendly, helpful and spoke english which was really appreciated as our Japanese was non existent :s.

The hotel boasts stunning views from the executive lounge and there is a host of restaurants in the hotel which would suit a business traveller with not much time to explore Tokyo. The facilities are great and there is a modern although modest sized gym and pool. We only used these once as there was so much to see and do in Tokyo, we didn't get many opportunities. We did manage to find time to get a foot massage which I can't recommend enough after walking around Tokyo all day. A word of warning though, if you don't like your massages firm and I mean really FIRM then make sure you tell the therapist. Don't get me wrong my feet felt brilliant afterwards but at times it was quite uncomfortable whilst she worked out the knots! Still well worth it and again the therapists were all really lovely.

In short, I couldn't recommend this hotel enough.

It is also worth noting that the location was perfect as it had excellent links to Shinjuku station with a regular free bus running from the hotel. Amazing hotel in the best city in the world, if only London and the rest of the UK was like this!",5,2014/10/09

The room was nice, clean and updated. The shower was also great.
It is very close to the government building. It has a great vew. Worth the short walk! Free of charge.

We booked 4 nights post cruise at the Hilton Tokyo. Our adult son was with us and we did not wish to book a second room, early communication led to a wonderfully large room with a rollaway for him. The food was outstanding. We opted for breakfast there every morning, and often did dinner there. Most of the staff spoke excellent English, so communication was not an issue. It was one of the better Hilton that we have stayed at in recent years.",5,2014/10/06
1,REDACTED,en,1969,"Stayed here for 4 nights on a trip to Japan with my husband. We asked to change rooms at first because the first one smelled like smoke, but the hotel was very accommodating. A lot of hotels in Japan have this issue and it was not a big deal, we were switched immediately. The room was modern and spare, with a comfortable armchair, a great bed, and enough storage space for both of us. Bathroom was small but new and clean. Service to the hotel room was prompt and thorough. 

The executive lounge at this hotel has a FABULOUS spread at all times of the day and night. The breakfast is fantastic with Western and Japanese options. The staff there is so nice. There is full bar service in the evenings and enough snacks to make a meal of if you're tired or don't like anything room service is offering. 

The location is excellent, you can get to a main train line by a passage that runs under the hotel and there are tons of restaurant and entertainment options in the area. 

Would stay here in a heartbeat. We used points + cash so it was very inexpensive, but I think that the price tag I saw for this hotel justifies the quality of the properties and the amenities.",5,2014/10/05

1,REDACTED,en,1971,"Sam Fan is THE man and Hilton Tokyo should adopt this expression. Seriously, this manager goes so far to treat guests like they are visiting royalty that you actually start to believe it lol Upon arrival, we were greeted by 2 managers and 2 bell hops ? Our luggage was taken to our room and we were offered a light snack due to very late night arrival which we declined although it was a lovely gesture. We had been upgraded at no extra charge and an apology was given for the upgrade-unintentionally funny. The facilities were excellent, my grandchildren especially loved the pool and the male staff member in that area had them laughing constantly. The buffet breakfasts were exceptional with an incredible variety of foods on offer. Sunrise Tours picks up tourists directly from the Tokyo Hilton and the Airport Limousine bus drops off and picks up directly from the Tokyo Hilton. The rail system is rather confusing however the hotel makes a point of giving you a card written in Japanese so you can ask people for help when you become a little lost. We stayed for 6 nights and would definitely like to return at some point in the future. Whilst this hotel most likely was designed for business people, it definitely caters for families and we met several during our stay.",5,2014/10/03

Service was impersonal, no acknowledgement of Hilton Gold Honours membership (through dedicated check-in or breakfast queues), slow and long lines at check-in, inconvenient location meaning you had to rely on the shuttle bus to get to Shinjuku Station which was always crowded and meant you had to line up at least 15 mins earlier to get on the bus and the beds were too hard (I woke up with a sore back!).

1,REDACTED,en,1973,"We stayed for 2 nights at this hotel and got an upgrade to the executive floor. The service at this hotel was absolutely flawless, and easily the best we have encountered. All the staff were super accommodating, helpful, and friendly. The hotel is close to the Tokyo Metropolitan Bldg and not walkable from Shinjuku station. You have to take the Marunouchi subway and get off at the Nishi Shinjuku station and walk a couple of minutes from there to the hotel. However, the hotel has a shuttle bus to Shinjuku station, which is super convenient (the cab ride from the hotel to Shinjuku station costs 730 yen). The shuttle departs from the hotel three times every hour (12, 32, and 52 minutes past the hour) and run until 9 pm. It also picks up from the west exit of the Shinjuku station three times per hour (00, 20, and 40 minutes past the hour). 

The breakfast spread at the hotel is a typical continental breakfast with some Japanese selection. The executive lounge has a limited selection of foods as well. The room was very comfortable, clean, big (for Tokyo), and had a great view. Would love to come back again!!",5,2014/10/01
1,REDACTED,en,1974,"I had been monitoring the reviews of this hotel for months prior to visit with them and now it's time for me to weigh in myself as I have quite a story to tell. My wife and I stayed at this property for 3 nights, 4 days at the end of September. We had booked an advanced reservation for 2 nights, 3 days initially, but we ended up extending our stay which required an additional reservation for the extra night. For both reservations, we chose to put in requests for eStandby upgrades, which some of the readers might be familiar with. In any case, when we arrived at the hotel for check-in, we were informed that we had been upgraded from our King Jr. Executive suite to the King Tower Suite. So far so good. So when we asked about how the Executive lounge and free Wi-Fi worked, we were told that this was not an Executive level package. I asked the gentleman to re-check the reservation as I was certain that we had booked an Executive level suite. He did so, but again re-stated that this was not an Executive suite. At this point, I said that we were going to decline the room upgrade in that case and go with our original reservation, which I knew to be Executive-level. He said that, unfortunately, there were no rooms available for our original reservation and that we would have to take the ""upgraded"" room. No mention was ever made about the fact that I had chosen numerous eStandby upgrades but was never given the choice of any. At this point, I was feeling fatigued from a long Shinkansen ride from Kyoto and I didn't have the strength to argue any further (plus it seemed like a very inappropriate thing to do in Japan), plus I wanted to double-check my reservation details privately to ensure that I hadn't made a mistake. They did offer me a slight discount on Wi-Fi and breakfast that I reluctantly took. 
Once we got to the suite, I found myself quite impressed with it despite being rather upset about check-in. So I immediately setup my laptop and starting looking into what had happened with my reservation. Strangely, when I looked up my original reservation, I could only see the confirmation number but it would not allow me to view the details of the reservation (I had done so numerous times in the past without problem which is why it was so strange); the details of the second reservation came up fine though. After reviewing what I could, I was no closer to an answer than when I started, so I found myself looking at the desk which had a generalized letter welcoming us to the Hilton and at the end of the letter it stated to contact them about any issues that might make our trip better. At this point, I realized that this was going to be a sour part of our trip unless I spoke out about it, plus I remembered reading replies from the hotel on this very message board where they stated that they wished people would've contacted them about issues when they still had a chance to make it right for them. So I wrote up a relatively long email explaining the issues I had encountered at check-in and just decided to leave it in their hands while we went out to run some errands.
Once we returned, we noticed a letter under the door. As we took it into the room, we further noticed a fruit arrangement on the table as well. The letter was the welcome letter to the Executive level that we assumed each member receives at check-in. No other messages were left, so I figured that they had replied to my e-mail. Sure enough, when I booted up my laptop, I had a lengthy response from the Reception Manager. He deeply apologized for the issues we encountered at check-in and assured us that this was not representative of the service normally offered by the Hilton. He further stated that he had pulled our records for eStandby and found that of the 3 requested upgrades we selected, 2 of them were for Executive level, and the one that was not, was the one that was given to us. Apparently, this was incorrect as alternatives should have been made available to us, but weren't. In any case, the hotel waived the room upgrade charges for the remaining days, cleared the bill of breakfast/Wi-Fi charges as we were Executive now, and offered us discounts on hotel services such as laundry. We were in awe of such service as nothing like this has EVER been offered to us in the past at any hotel chain. 2 nights later, the hotel also formally recognized my wife's birthday with some goodies that were a total surprise.
No one likes to have issues with checking into a hotel; however, I am sure glad that I spoke up about it because I truly believe that the Hilton Tokyo hotel more than made up for the issues we encountered. Even before we checked into the hotel, we were already experiencing their wonderful hospitality thanks to a member of their Concierge team by the name of Ayako Nakamura. Nakamura-san had arranged for some professional photos that we took in Kyoto to be shipped to the hotel and then later forwarded to our US address when it was discovered that the photo studio could not ship the finished hardcover book to the US directly. This kind of customer service was inspiring and served as a reminder just how different hotels in the US are compared to those in Japan, where people bend over backwards to help out complete strangers everyday. 
Finally, I must thank Mr. Fan and Mr. Ogura for helping us work through our issues and providing us with an experience that we are still frankly in awe of. We feel as though we made friends in the both of you and hope to see you during a future visit. For the readers who managed to make it this far, Hilton Tokyo is the real deal. It is a clean, modern hotel that has an amazing staff that is literally waiting to help make your stay better in any way that they can. If you can learn one thing from my experience, I would hope that it is to speak up about issues that the hotel can help you with. Don't just run to TripAdvisor or any other site to bash the hotel, but instead, I would encourage you to give them the opportunity to fix the problem as they did for us. We can't wait to stay at Hilton Tokyo again!",5,2014/10/01
1,REDACTED,en,1975,"stayed three nights in a triple room. Large by Tokyo standards.

The shuttle bus which operates at 20 min intervals to Shinjuku Station was a major plus. At the basement of the hotel itself is also the Tochomae station which can bring you to the Asakusa area. 

Service at the hotel was efficient and super friendly.

Just across the road is a Denny's restaurant which serves decent western food.

The toiletries in the hotel are nice. The only down side is that there is no complimentary bottles of drinking water. There is a convenience store just at the basement where u can buy though.

All in all, I would stay there again.",4,2014/09/30
1,REDACTED,en,1976,"Located more in the CBD area of Shinjuku its about a 15min walk to the main train station of Shinjuku and the shopping area.However theres a subway station about 5mins walk away and is connected by an underground walkway from next to the hotel`s shuttle bus stop.Hotel shuttle bus runs every 20mins from morning to night stopping at the Odakyu Department store next to the airport limousine..Right next door to the hotel is a hospital and very tall office blocks in the surrounding vicinity.Behind is a big park and opposite is the Hyatt Hotel.There is a Dennys behind and a few more restaurants on the way to Shinjuku station.
The airport limousine bus from Haneda and Narita drops and picks passengers up from the hotel so its easy access to both airports.Tickets can be bought at the Concierge.Bags unloaded from the bus by the porters but no assistance offered to transport your bags to the reception or room..Cozy average size lobby with the lobby cafe to the right as you enter.Checkin swift and polite and typical Japanese businesslike efficency.
Rooms have been renovated so its very new bright and clean.Decor is modern black white and beige.The twin beds that i had were one of the smallest beds i have ever slept in a hotel.I just barely fit into them.Size of room is average with all the usual amenities provided.Theres a red lounger that immediately catches your eyes as you enter because its such a contrast to the decor of the room.
Toilet again is brand spanking new so you can see and feel how clean and shiny everything is.Like all other Hiltons...you are supplied with nice Peter Thomas Roth toiletries.
Internet as usual is chargeable at 1700yen a day but is free in the lobby.Remember this is Japan so everything is expensive.If you decide to have breakfast in bed it will cost you a whopping 3500yen for an american breakfast..which doesnt include taxes.The only good thing is you dont have to worry about how much to tip as there is no tipping.",4,2014/09/28
1,REDACTED,en,1977,"This was my first stay at Hilton Tokyo and I was pleasantly surprised with the nicely updated rooms which have a chic, modern appearance, and the friendly service. There are pool and tennis courts, which are nice amenities for an urban location like this one, and the hotel is incredibly clean. Many good dining options right on site. My only complaint is that the fitness room should be bigger given the size of property.",4,2014/09/28
1,REDACTED,en,1978,"I stayed at the Hilton in Shinjuku, Tokyo. It was a beautiful hotel. Hilton provided a very relaxing time during my business trip. The room was spacious and the Sauna and jacuzzi was excellent. The staff could speak english which was very helpful when my colleague was sick and needed to see a doctor. They were very helpful here in directing us. Thank you Hilton",5,2014/09/27
1,REDACTED,en,1979,"We stayed here for 4 nights in a deluxe room, check in was easy and quick and all the hotel spoke good English, 
The room was on the 22 floor and had a view over the town.
We had to pay for Wi Fi if we wanted it in our room which was around £12 for 24 hours.
Unfortunately the hotel restaurants were all closed due to refit apart from the lobby buffet restaurant, which served a pretty average choice of food for breakfast.
The hotel bar had something on every night normally a jazz band or singer, the bar was done as typical English pub and served cod & chips, pizza and sandwiches.
There is a free bus service which goes every 20 minutes and takes you and collects you to Shinjuka. 
Before we got to Japan we thought we would have a lot of difficulty getting around on the trains and having problems with not knowing any of the Japanese language but it's not as bad as everyone makes out, well not in Tokyo anyway.
Overall I would recommend the Hilton Tokyo if you stay in Shinjinku",4,2014/09/27
1,REDACTED,en,1980,"Excellent hotel. The rooms are very spacious for Japanese standards and the staff are very friendly. There is a free shuttle to Shinjuku JR stations but the walk there is only 10-15 minutes and its a perfect walk at night if you are not in a rush for time. The orange airport limousines are also available to either Narita or Haneda airport, both very economical and fast ways to reach the airports. I will definitely be going back!",5,2014/09/25
1,REDACTED,en,1981,"Easy access from Haneda Airport by Limousine Bus, the fare is reasonable and drop you off to the door of the hotel. Check-in lobby is small but OK, no special line for Hilton Honors member tho. The room is not big, but I guess you won't expect a big room in Tokyo. The bathroom is neat and clean. The Excutive Lounge got awesome view qne nice selection of drinks. The buffet breakfast is awesome, with mix of western and Japanese flavored food! The hotel got the direct connection to the subway via underpass, also hotel privde free shuttle bus to Shinjuku station every 20 minutes back and forth. The concierge staffs behind the counter is not very attentive, but I guess they were busy with other guests. Other staff may approach you and see if I need any help. General speaking a nice and satisfactory stay.",4,2014/09/25
1,REDACTED,en,1982,Location is one of the best while I did not expect a big convenience in terms of the transportation access. The place used to be nowhere near to get trains without 15 minutes walk at least. Now I figured that there are couple of choices to get subway on top of taxi and limo.,4,2014/09/25
1,REDACTED,en,1983,"Spent a night there in the early of Sept prior to catch a flight back home the next day. Although they were busy but it shouldn't be an excuse for not turn on the air condition of my room prior to our arrival, particularly it was a hot day that day. The air condition in the room also having a problem during our stay which resulted a poor night sleep.

Never be informed by any staff about the availablity of free shuttle bus service to station.

Breakfast got a good variety.

Overall not up to a Hilton standard that I experienced elsewhere.",3,2014/09/23
1,REDACTED,en,1984,"I had the good fortune to stay at the Hilton recently. I found the staff considerate and helpful. Nothing was a problem. I felt that the staff were focused on my experience at the hotel being positive.

The rooms are nicely finished with quality inclusions. The entire Hotel is very clean, the breakfast was well provided. I did not find one staff member who could not speak English.

AS a Hilton club member the in-room WiFi was free. There is plenty of transport options nearby.

I will go back and would be happy to recommend this Hotel.",5,2014/09/21
1,REDACTED,en,1985,"Newly renovated rooms are always great way to go in any hotel & the room we booked was modern, functional & very comfy. Add a buffet breakfast (with a coffee/espresso bar) that rivals any US one & you get some smiling guests every morning! Staff was always polite & helpful, as are the staff in any Japanese hotel. Just as The south in America is known for its hospitality, you can expect the same in Japan. A great bonus we found was a shuttle that takes you to the largest subway station in the area (which makes it easy for those coming from the airport (which will cost you 100US in a taxi) & we used it often. There is also an airport shuttle bus that will cost you way less, but it stops after 10 I believe & no reservations are needed from the airport & will cost you around 15US. Going back, however, reservations are needed & can be made at the concierge desk. Umbrellas are found all over the area & seemed to be stocked for all those needing them. When you no longer need it, leave it in the nearest stand. Shopping abounds where the shuttle takes you, as are places other than the hotel to eat. There is also a huge electronics (camera/computer) store there, which made my husband smile. A tiny Starbucks for me near it & we were both happy!",4,2014/09/20
1,REDACTED,en,1986,"I recently stayed here for a little over 1 week. During that time I was fortunate to be up-up-upgraded to the Tower Suite - an impressive suite with a bed wider than long, dual bathrooms, and a lounge area 3 times larger than the bedroom. This is the best hotel room I have ever stayed in.

However good things must come to an end so after 3 nights I was asked to downgrade to a Jr King Suite (still a grade higher than I booked). This suite was amply spacious, beautifully renovated. Also an absolutely fantastic room, despite having no cold water pressure at all. 

For the final night I was asked to stay in the room grade I paid for, perhaps as some sort of morbid punishment for the upgrades the week prior. This room had not been renovated and boy it showed. It you only receive a normal room you are missing out on one of the best hotels in the world.

Downsides: the pool is a complete joke. No free Wifi (also a joke - come on its the year 2014 and they are charging $20/night). Its a good 10 minute walk from the station and the free shuttle (20 min frequency) stops relatively early.",3,2014/09/17
1,REDACTED,en,1987,"Staff excellent and friendly. Facilities clean and welcoming. The lobby area is the only place for free wifi so folks tend to congregate there. If you want privacy for emailing/skype and a place to sit, you either pay for wifi in your room or find the nearest free spot nearby - like a metro station!",4,2014/09/17
1,REDACTED,en,1988,"I spent 4 nights at Hilton Tokyo and I was assigned a spacious and newly renovated room (Deluxe room). The breakfast buffet was nice and it offered lots of different drinks, especially you are allowed to take away a cup of nice coffee or tea. The seating area was spacious so I felt very comfortable and enjoyable when having my breakfast
Although there is a shuttle bus service from the hotel to Shinjuku JR station, it is actually not very far if you walk from the hotel to the Shinjuku center (around 10 on foot). Also, if you take the metro,not JR, you can just walk there less than 5 mins.
Overall it was a nice experience and will defintely stay there again in the future.",5,2014/09/16
1,REDACTED,en,1989,"Had a very nice stay here a year ago and this time was the same. Nothing but cordial people who are eager to assist at every turn. Concierge, Ms. Sato was excellent when we needed her. She's very helpful. Shuttle service to and from Shinjuku Station was very convenient on the Hilton bus. Again, very nice drivers. Many restaurants are all around the hotel and in the station area. There's an observation deck in a nearby bldg where you can see the entire city and if the weather's clear, all the way to Mt Fuji. Great hotel, great city...already looking forward to the next visit.",5,2014/09/16
1,REDACTED,en,1990,"Stayed here last month. During check-in, requested for late check-out due to late afternoon flight the next day, and was delighted to have been offered an upgrade to executive room as HH Gold.

However, I was a bit disappointed that the hotel card keys didn't work twice consecutively. Went to the front desk for assistance and was satisfied by their speedy resolution to reset the lock and issue a new card. 

The property is crowded with guests, which seems to be a frequent occurrence based on others feedback, which demonstrates the immense popularity of the hotel. Hotel is accessible from Shinjuku JR west station via a shuttle bus (black colour) which runs trice hourly.

Had an evening buffet at the ground floor restaurant, and was satisfied with the quality although I expected the spread of Japanese food to be greater.

Upon check-out, am delighted to be given a cute Hilton bear which was so much larger than the one received at Conrad Tokyo. Took the airport limousine (a bus) arranged by the hotel to Narita",4,2014/09/16
1,REDACTED,en,1991,"Its totally worth it! I think 300+ for such hotel is an attractive price. They are 10mins walk away from station, have complimentary shuttle service to train station that runs at every 20mins intervals till almost 10pm, a 24 Hr gym, an indoor swimming pool till 10pm, Airport express bus to and from Narita or Hanade Airport. 

I stayed in their deluxe rooms be it queen, king or twin. 
Rooms are nice, clean, comfortable and spacious for Japan standard.
The bathroom may be on the simpler side, however its well equipped with nice electronic bidet and bathtub.

Cant quite remember who helped us that night to make a lunch reservation. He went all way to assist us, calling a few outlets, checking its availability. Kudos to their staff.

On our day of departure, I saw the staff making ice shaven colored soda for children. It such a heartwarming sight.

Will definitely return and recommend this hotel.",5,2014/09/16
1,REDACTED,en,1992,"We stayed here for 6 nights on a 2 week trip to Japan. The location is excellent, in the heart of Shinjuku (though we realized later that for non-Japanese its better to stay in/around Roopongi).

The hotel has underground walkway access to Metro which was a great benefit. The breakfast buffet was sumptuous though it never got changed for all 6 days (so we decided to skip it on our last day). The rooms were small though but real estate in Tokyo is precious.

If you get access to executive lounge, which we were, the 37th floor lounge has great views, food almost all day ans cocktails in the evening.

Overall, a good choice.",5,2014/09/14
1,REDACTED,en,1993,"I don't usually opt for such large properties but booked here as a nod to a stay as a teenager, where I experienced terrific service… obviously this was quite a few years ago. Stayed in an executive junior suite, apparently newly refurbished.

Overall, it's hard to fault this hotel as far as big chains go - this is a place for airline crews (SQ, LH, etc stay here), large groups of tourists and as a good location for a low cost leisure stay in Tokyo – Shinjuku has many points of interest in itself. Rates are very low and there seem to be a lot of promos. To be fair, my overall rating of the property reflects this reality and not the comments below (which would score one or two points less).

Without status however, this is not a welcoming property - it seems Hilton has taken loyalty to its limits, as, if anything, it now acts as a barrier of entry to non-HHonors guests - pretty stupid if you ask me. First time in ages I had to pay for Wifi (JPY1700/day) and denied checking out one hour later than standard as next guest ""had status and was entitled to check-in at exactly 2pm"" (would she?). Considering some guests don't mind paying for larger suites or better rooms, there is absolutely no reason to stay here without status since you will be treated worse than anyone with a Gold card - which are ubiquitous it seems thanks to countless tie-ins with credit cards or other promos... 

The room itself is wholly uninspiring and looks very dated already - seem to have been assembled through a knock-off catalogue of bad Italian design - the only Japanese detail (and original from way back) are the rice paper sliding shutters - bathroom is tiny and reminiscent of the one in the Novotel Wanchai I had to stay in during a typhoon in Hong Kong. Very cheap amenities too - made in China toiletries, cheap/thin paper products and incredibly poor towels... considering this is likely to be your first tactile experience of the room it immediately creates a poor impression - you know there are cost-savings at every turn. There are some bad design choices too - a single multi-plug electric outlet by the desk is located in a box and under the glass table - very hard to access especially if using a larger three-point plug... 

Breakfast which I was looking forward to, was awful, with overall, poor quality items. I was also admonished for picking a quieter table in the zoo of breakfast with a comment that it had to be vacated before 11am (at 9am... why would anyone spend 2 hours with such a disappointing spread is anyone's guess). 

So there you have it – decent and dare I say convenient for a low cost stay, this property has made it pointless to book there for non-status guests looking for a better room / experience... why keep being reminded of what you’re not receiving when it’s clear that so many of these so-called benefits are standard elsewhere… makes no sense.

I’ve long got bored with chasing miles and points, after a few fun years with Randy and the original flyertalk crew, and as a former HH Diamond/ SPG Platinum/etc it strikes me that confusing loyalty management for true hospitality is probably a pretty bad long term mistake.",3,2014/09/14
1,REDACTED,en,1994,"Got in pretty late and found out they had a room available to upgrade. It included internet and access to the Executive Lounge, a difference of about $50 bucks but was it worth it. Huge room, very clean. The executive lounge had a huge breakfast in the morning both Western dishes and Japanese dishes, they even had mimosas. Great way to start the day! And great cocktail hour with appetizers which was a nice way to relax after long day of sight seeing. The subway station is right under the hotel so it made getting around very easy,",5,2014/09/13

1,REDACTED,en,1996,"I stayed at the Hilton for a week while on business. It is a beautiful hotel located in the business district of Shinjuku ku. The rooms were very modern and updated; The bathroom was fantastic (soaking tub); And I will always be charmed by Japanese toilets....yes, odd to say.....but the Japanese have created such fantastic toilets with so many settings its like driving a small car.

The train station is a very short walk or quick shuttle from the train station. Beware, I found the trains to be very complicated and I have traveled the world. There is great shopping and restaurants close by. Get out at night and see the amazing light show of billboards, large screen videos, etc., all located just a few blocks from the hotel.

I had club level access which offered attentive service and great food options. It was a nice mixture of Eastern and Western cuisine. The view was spectacular.

If you have time, book a private your guide who can help navigate you to some of the most impressive areas of Tokyo. My guide was an amazing 70+ year old Japanese gentleman who spoke good English and met me at the hotel. Dont get me wrong......You would never have known his age and he consistently out-paced me everywhere we went. He was such a lovely man.

Be open to true Japanese cuisine. Make sure you try Shabu-Shabu - the concierge can direct you to a recommended spot. Also, venture into a local sushi bar to get true sushi. I dont know what I ate, which was probably a good thing, but it was all delicious.
I left my heart in Tokyo and can only pray that I have the opportunity to return to this beautiful, friendly, safe city. I would absolutely stay at the Hilton upon my return.",5,2014/09/11
1,REDACTED,en,1997,"This hotel is located close to Shinjuku station and has a free shuttle bus to and from the station every 20 mins. This was one of the deciding factors in choosing it and it proved to be very handy indeed. The Hilton itself is a very nice hotel with attentive staff and good amenities. Breakfast was excellent, so was room service. The pool looked inviting, but heated to 30 degrees so not an option in hot weather. Our room was quiet and comfortable. We asked for a room on a higher floor to avoid any possible renovation noise that was mentioned in some previous reviews. We had no disruptions and slept well. There is a small supermarket and several restaurants underneath the hotel and a chemist shop near the business centre. We found these extra services very handy when tired and hot at the end of a long day. We found Hilton Tokyo to be an excellent choice for tourists and thoroughly recommend it.",4,2014/09/09
1,REDACTED,en,1998,"Stayed there for three nights on our return leg from Sapporo. The hotel was a drop-off/pick-up point for the airport limousine bus service, which means you'll be dropped at the door step of the hotel. Room was spacious (for Tokyo's standard) and well appointed. We stayed on the 33rd floor which offered a great view.

Breakfast had good variety, but the food type appears to be the same. But if you're sitting at one of the sofa seats, the table can be a little low.

A major advantage of Hilton is there's a shuttle bus every 20min running between the hotel and Shinjuku station, stopping in front of Keio department store. This really helped as the walk to Shinjuku station from the hotel in the summer heat can be a challenge. Another advantage is the hotel is linked underground to one of the Tokyo Metro's station.

Overall a very good experience",4,2014/09/08
1,REDACTED,en,1999,"We asked for a room high up when we reserved and were rewarded with a lovely view of the megalopolis from one of the top floors. Never a wait for the elevators and they are fast. Excellent concierge service. We had all sorts of strange requests ranging from printing out the michelin bib gourmand restaurants in Shinjuku (website only in Japanese :) and where to get a professional tailor's scissor as a friend in Paris had heard that the Japanese make the best. Neither was a problem for the concierge (unfortunately I do not remember his name) who gladly took the time to research and write everything down. The only negative experience was at the bar at night. Having ordered drinks and sitting at our table, I noticed I had to plug in my smart phone and proceeded to use a plug at the end of the bar where no one was sitting. The manager in charge rushed up to me enquiring 'Can I help you' - seeing I was just plugging in my phone, I took that to mean I needed to ask for his personal permission before deigning to use 'his' plug' It was a rather bizarre situation and I did complain to the Assistant Manager the next day who apologized. But we never went back there so Hilton lost a bit of business from us because of that (had I been Assistant Manager I would have offered 2 drinks on the house the next evening). Location-wise you are walking distance to the Shinjuku station with rail lines going everywhere you need, usually with no need to transfer. The walk is a brisk 20 minutes from door to train. There is a shuttle from the bus to the station but if you are a walker it is better not to wait. We figured out a short cut going diagonally across the street to the lobby of the highrise (the one with the Willer Express buses in front of it), then down the escalator and left, out the door and straight to the station. Also nice for a blast of AC when walking in the summer heat and humidity. Overall a very good experience.",4,2014/09/07

the breakfast buffets on both the executive floor & ground level contained everything you could hope for & more!

Then they exchanged my yen for new crisp yen for the card--I would not have even known that I should do that for the wedding!! The room was larger than I expected, the bathroom especially was great, the breakfast buffet and lounge were wonderful, the pool and spa were terrific, too.

We were able to store excess baggage and gifts at the hotel during our trip through Japan and picked it up before flying back home.",4,2014/09/04
1,REDACTED,en,2003,"This was my first trip to Tokyo, and I booked this hotel using points. I am a Hilton Diamond member, and have stayed and a number of very nice properties throughout the world. I can say that the service at the Hilton Tokyo is the best I have experienced.

For example, prior to visiting Tokyo I was working in Vietnam and didn't have time to plan my activities in advance. I really wanted to see a Sumo Wrestling Match as well as a Japanese Baseball Game. I called the concierge to see if they could assist me. I worked with Ayako, who was incredibly helpful. She informed me that there while there were no Sumo matches in Tokyo the weekend I was in town, there were a couple of events that I could attend outside of Tokyo. She then provided all of the details for me (train tickets, cost of event, directions, etc). When I arrived at the hotel, not only did I have all of this information, but she even went so far as to include questions/directions in Japanese for me to hand to someone in either the train or taxi to make my journey easier. I thought this went above and beyond anything I had expected. Thanks to Ayoko and team, I was able to attend the Sumo match and saw everything I wanted to see in Tokyo.

Aside from the fantastic concierge service, I would rate the overall hotel at 4 out of 5. It is very nice. It is located right near the subway lines, and all points of the city are easily accessible. Diamond Members will receive an upgraded room, access to the Executive Floor and free buffet breakfasts each day. 

Overall, I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Tokyo.",4,2014/09/03
1,REDACTED,en,2004,"My mate and I are 20 years old who are always willing to pay a little extra to have comfort and convenience. When we first walked in their you could tell straight away that it lacked personality and was for those who just want to get in and out and have more money than they need. I never expect much but I actually felt uncomfortable in this hotel. I think it was because we were dressed in casual clothing. 
I requested an early check in at the desk and was told we could go in 2 hours earlier if we paid for a room that was 80,000 Yen more expensive, fair enough we couldn't get an early check in but that was a bit step.
With WiFi in the room, there was an option for free WiFi at slow speeds or faster speeds for a cost. The slow speed that was advertised is what I was used to in Australia, with our slow internet. The internet barely worked, kept dropping out and was frustrating. Also what was weird was that I then couldn't pay for the faster internet after I discovered how poor the connection was.
The room was not that great (I had just come from the capsule hotel as well), it was nice but not for the prices that they advertise. 

The most helpful info I can give anyone that read this is that there is a shuttle bus to Narita Airport from the hotel, I paid about 36AUD I think it was about 3600 Yen. That was really convenient, although triple check and I MEAN TRIPLE check where and when the bus will arrive, because the staff may not be able to answer so well with the language barrier. I always appreciate the fact that they speak this second language for our convenience but please give the right answer (I don't want to sound mean but it was seriously a close call missing the bus which would have resulted in a missed flight, I'm so glad I stuck with my gut feeling and asked a third person)",3,2014/09/03
1,REDACTED,en,2005,"I stayed at the Hilton Hotel in Shinjuku many times. Cleanliness, good food, and the service you expect in Japan makes this hotel a good place to stay while in Tokyo.If you're able to stay on the executive floor this makes for an exceptional wonderful plus with all the amenities.",5,2014/09/02
1,REDACTED,en,2006,"I booked a Suite for 7 days and it was fabulous. 

Took a couple of friends over and spent the week enjoying the city. I booked the club level so that we had access to the additional food options and without a doubt it was fantastic! Breakfast was delicious - no need to go get food elsewhere and you can head out for a day on the town then come back later to enjoy a cocktail and tapas before doing Karaoke locally.

Shinjuku is a great location, not far from a busy train station and loads of food and entertainment options. The staff are amazing and friendly and help you organise anything you need.

There are direct Airport to hotel buses from both airports. They work out to be around $30AUD. Great value!",5,2014/09/01
1,REDACTED,en,2007,Hotel is 5 Stars standard and Location is a little bit fast to Metro but hotel offer free shuttle bus.

1,REDACTED,en,2008,"The hotel was super fantastic, service and location near to perfection. They mentioned that for reconstruction work at level 2, some noise could disturb our stay, nothing heard. Staff very friendly and helpful, breakfast very rich and well organised as well as the italian buffet at dinner was excellent. If ever get back to Tokyo we will go to Hilton again",5,2014/09/01
1,REDACTED,en,2009,"I took my daughter on a post-exam trip to Japan and chose this hotel due to its location near Shinjuku station. There is a shuttle bus which runs at frequent intervals during the day but, if you feel energetic, it is only a half mile walk - part underground - from Shinjuku station (the world's busiest railway station) to the hotel. Shinjuku station is served by direct trains from Narita Airport (Narita Express) upon which Japan Rail passes are valid. It is also well connected by train to other parts of Tokyo although no Shinkansen services call there for these you either need Tokyo station or Shimbashi if heading towards Osaka or Hiroshima.
The Hotel itself is modern, serves a great breakfast and an excellent Executive lounge. Rooms are great and have a hint of Japan about them. The staff on reception speak excellent English and I found them extremely helpful. Only slight issue was the cost - we stayed a night on two separate occasions, second time getting an upgrade to an Executive Junior Suite due my Gold status - but I guess you do pay a lot for a Central Tokyo hotel.",4,2014/09/01
1,REDACTED,en,2010,"We stayed in a king junior suite that was spacious and pleasantly decorated. The hotel was peaceful and quiet, as if there were no other guests in the hotel.

We did like their breakfast and cocktails, as well. We are looking forward to our our next stay in Hilton Tokyo. Highly recommend!",5,2014/09/01
1,REDACTED,en,2011,"This was a business trip and I chose the Hilton due to it's location. Overall, this is a great hotel with fantastic facilities.

Definitely looking forward to coming back to this hotel in future and will easily recommend it to others. Try the Jacuzzi!",4,2014/09/01
1,REDACTED,en,2012,5 star hotel in Shinjuku area. Very strategic place. They have 24 hour convinience store underground. They also have private shuttle bus to Shinjuku metro station. The room was clean & comfortable. I will stay here when i come back to Tokyo again.,5,2014/08/31

1,REDACTED,en,2014,"We stayed at the Tokyo hilton for one night with our infant. The hotel is beautiful. We were upgraded to deluxe rooms, and were given a discounted rate for breakfast. A crib was already in our room upon check-in, and they let us check in an hour early, at 1pm. The pool is small, but very nice. If you are not familiar with hotels in Asia, you might be upset by the firm mattress and smaller rooms, but you're not going to find much better here. 

The breakfast buffet was amazing, and definitely worth it.",5,2014/08/31
1,REDACTED,en,2015,"Good choice in Shinjuku area if your purpose of visit is business. Strategic location. Service is highly friendly with a very good English understanding. Rooms are big, for Japan standards, and clean. Equipped with everything you need for a business or leisure trip. Breakfast was also a good point with plenty of choices. Restaurants are under renovation and facilities are good enough. I will recommend and probably come back in my next stay in Tokyo.",4,2014/08/30
1,REDACTED,en,2016,We stayed here on Hilton Honors points. Great location for getting around the city. Close to the subway and train systems. Can actually walk underground to them. Rooms are average.

1,REDACTED,en,2017,disappointed. Was told at counter we were upgraded to bigger room but smoking room. In the end room is small and no double bed. Me and hub have to sleep separate! No water in room need to call for service to send up. No basic vanity set in toilet. First horror was counter checked us in as 3 pax in a room! Told us it's two bed room.. lucky we clarified and my male friend got him so called bigger room but smoking room like us. Not looking forward to the remaining 7 nights here... boo!,1,2014/08/30

1,REDACTED,en,2019,"Very helpful pleasant staff from the moment you arrive until you leave, the rooms are nice but the bathrooms are certainly on the small side, food in the restaurant is excellent that is breakfast and evening meal fantastic choices, great for being near Shinjuka but a little way to travel to be in the centre but still would stay here again",5,2014/08/29
1,REDACTED,en,2020,"We stayed here for two weeks, used as our base visiting Japan. We found it easy to get around, with the two subway stations linked by foot subway from the hotel and easy walk to main Shinjuju JR Station. Room was immaculate with amazing views, slight niggle is we asked for non smoking when booking and we got smoking. 

Free wifi in the lobby area, with seating. The breakfasts are superb - buffet style, so help yourself to traditional food (hot and cold), or more Westernised sausages, bacon, waffles, cereal. 

Staff were lovely, very helpful and friendly - especially the concierge and catering staff. Used the sport facilities - pool and gym - and the lovely tennis courts. We have already recommended the hotel to friends since returning from our break.",5,2014/08/28

Immediately upon arrival we were treated to a much nicer lobby, friendly and helpful staff and a quick check in. We were given a high floor room without having to request it.

The rooms are clean and spacious, the bathrooms are a bit small but no complaints otherwise.

Airport shuttles are a terrific convenience to consider too.",5,2014/08/26
1,REDACTED,en,2024,We had a wonderful 9 days at the Hilton Tokyo and would highly recommend the executive suites for families - they are huge by Tokyo standards. My two children had full size roll away beds and there was still room for the couches and work desk in the lounge area - especially loved the nespresso machine! The master bedroom was separated by a sliding door - it was more like a small apartment than a hotel room. My son still talks about the breakfasts - lots of choice and fantastic service. The indoor pool is great - we used it several times with the kids and never saw anyone else. The executive rooms and suites provide access to the executive lounge - fantastic for pre-dinner drinks.,5,2014/08/25
1,REDACTED,en,2025,"Took family of six for vacation and stayed here for 5 nights. Great location, facilities, and service. Executive lounge was very nice and breakfast buffet was outstanding. Shuttle bus was convenient and local subway was close. Would stay here again.",5,2014/08/25
1,REDACTED,en,2026,"Loved this hotel. The service was out of this world. The attention to detail and the servicing of the room was first class. Food was great, a good selection to choose from. I was very impressed.

We stayed in an executive suite, it was lovely. Small criticism that there was not a lot of storage which is always needed for a lady!

Location was good, could be a little more central. We were about a ten minute walk from a tube station and then about a half hour into the central tokyo. However, Shinjuku (the area in which the hotel is located) has more than enough amenities if you don't want to into central Tokyo.

Big criticism is the lack of free internet. There was free internet access in the lobby but you had to pay £9 a day for internet in the room. I think this is very expensive and there should be no need to charge for internet.",4,2014/08/24
1,REDACTED,en,2027,This hotel is an excellent choice. The hotel room was huge compared to many of the Tokyo city hotels I've stayed in the past. The bed was extremely comfortable. The hotel was very beautifully done with many comforts and conveniences including a 24 hour restaurant perfect for arriving late travelers! Room service was fantastic as well. Staff was helpful and wonderfully pleasant. The room bathrooms are small and a bit old but how much time do you really spend time in a bathroom? The limousine bus makes a direct stop at this hotel which was perfect flying into and out of Narita airport. There is also a complimentary shuttle bus that takes you to and from shinjuku station for train and bus travelers! There is a subway line directly beneath the hotel as well! The location is great in shinjuku right in the middle of everything with a Starbucks across the street as well! I highly recommend this hotel.,5,2014/08/23

Very nice location, good rooms, gym and excellent buffet...very nice & polite english speaking girls at the hotel reception...all types of shops, restaurants just at a walking distance of 5 mins. I would really recommend this hotel for the visitors planning to stay near Shinjuku area during their trip to Japan",5,2014/08/20
1,REDACTED,en,2030,"Location & Transport: The hotel is located at Shinjuku, walking distance from train station, very convenient as the Shinjuku is a must-visit in Tokyo. However, do not try to walk from train station with your luggage. No need to take cab from airport to hotel. Airport express will drop you at hotel lobby directly (second drop-off point from airport), cheaper if you buy return tickets (instead of one-way ticket), generous discount if you purchase tickets with a JCB credit card.

Room: Stunning view, modern Japanese design, comfortable and clean. We stayed for 2 nights, nothing to complain at all. Room is slightly small but acceptable, this is Tokyo what do you expect? Gym is small but we did not use Gym during our stay – so much to see in Tokyo!

Service: Most staff can communicate in English well, please do speak clearly and avoid complex sentence structure. They are very polite and helpful. For example, when check-in, we were very sleepy and we had a lot of languages (after 3-week trip at California, Tokyo was the last stop and I was exhausted after a night flight from LAX). I was half-jokingly talking to the check-in staff if we could have room with least walking distance as we want to reach our room asap, they immediately brought our bags up (the lady did not accept our tips) and gave us the first room from the lift lobby (*smile* this is kind of cute). On the last night, my mate was not feeling well and I changed my transport schedule to airport last-minute, they quickly arranged transport for me.

Price: Reasonable given the quality of the service, its location and the city it is in. I will certainly book with them again.",5,2014/08/19
1,REDACTED,en,2031,"We had an executive suite, we loved the view of the city from here. Executive Lounge was lovely with great appies and a fresh breakfast! The hotel was very clean.

1,REDACTED,en,2032,"A really nice hotel with great rooms, good gym facilities and an excellent breakfast buffet which is crucial. 

Also as I found out one drunken night, 24/7 food available from downstairs. Don't remember eating it and apparently was a mess but the kind hotel staff catered for my drunken munchies ha ha",5,2014/08/18
1,REDACTED,en,2033,"We stayed here from 9th August - 16th August and we had good experiences every day. At check-in, we were offered early-check in at 11am and our 3 rooms on Level 34 provided us amazing view of Shinjuku and Tokyo as a whole. We also got discounted price for breakfast buffets because of our long stay at the hotel by the friendly receptionist.

Location-wise, it's located at the safer and quieter side of Shinjuku but the hotel provides a free shuttle bus to Shinjuku Station which stop in front of Keio Department Store (bus stop number 21) and this is really convenient for guests. If you prefer, you can also walk from the hotel to the hipper and louder side of Shinjuku which is only like 10 mins walk away.

Because it's summer and it's tremendously hot in Tokyo, the hotel even provided guests with free flavoured shaved ice at the hotel's lobby and hired a friendly guy to provide cute balloons to the kids. This is especially appealing to us because we had a 3 year-old with us who enjoyed this so much!

The concierge has a complete file of attractions in Tokyo and even if they don't (which is quite rare because they knew basically everything), they'll try their hardest to assist you.

Some really minor issues:

1) The rooms were cleaned quite late in the evening. On some days, the rooms weren't cleaned even at 5pm and we called to enquire about it. It wouldn't be a problem if you come back later in the evening but if you stay indoors most times, this may be a bit of problem. Good point: when they clean your rooms, they really clean them throughout. I thought their works were good :)

2) We were told that it was the school holidays when we went hence MAYBE that's why the hotel was so packed throughout our stay. At breakfast, there were long queues before we got seated so there was always that battle of patience every morning. Bonus point: wholesome Asian breakfast!!

3) We had a baby with us and he was cranky all night and I got some rude guests to shout at us to ask the baby to ""shut up"". HOWEVER, we were pleased that when we called the guest relation office, they quickly came up and helped to sort it out somehow (I don't know how) and we never heard from that rude white person again.

Overall, the staff were really attentive. They are well-staffed at the lobby area but maybe Hilton could do better in terms of house-keeping. 5 star stay. I would come back to stay here on my next visit!",5,2014/08/16
1,REDACTED,en,2034,"My wife and I stayed at the Hilton for 17 days when we were preparing to move. I have diamond status so they gave us free internet, which is fast (although we have to sign up every day, which is annoying), free breakfast, and access to the executive lounge. Breakfast was a large buffet with EXACTLY the same food every day. The omelet chefs were fantastic. The chocolate chip muffins were quite good, although often they were stored in the same cabinet as the banana bread, which made them taste like banana bread. Everything else was pretty mediocre. The sausage was hot dogs and the bacon was crap. The executive lounge suffers from the same malaise as the breakfast buffet - same mediocre stuff all the time. It is depressing to go in every night and see chicken nuggets with ketchup (sometimes called ""BBQ sauce""). It's fine if you want to serve the same chicken nuggets, fried veg, samosas every night, but just offer some Thai chili sauce to go with it and people will be happy. Better yet, take a page from the recipe book of the Hilton on the Park Melbourne (or any of the Hiltons in Victoria, New South Wales, or South Australia), which has consistently excellent offerings in the executive lounge. The room was fairly small, but we were traveling with a pet, and I believe they have certain rooms set aside for people with pets, so I wasn't expecting an upgrade. The fitness center was very nice - plenty of cardio equipment and just enough weights. In general the staff were friendly and helpful. The location was great, and in case you're here in the rainy season there is a tunnel that leads from the lobby to Tochomae metro station. This was very convenient. In general a mostly positive experience, I just wish they would have gotten the food right.",4,2014/08/16
1,REDACTED,en,2035,"I stayed at the Hilton for 3 nights, and it was a very good way to start my trip in Japan. The location is great, in the middle of Shinjuku, close to Tochomae station (do NOT think to walk with your bags from Shinjuku station, it doesn't make sense!) and the property is in very good condition.

The room was not too spacious, but very clean, nicely furnished and with enough closet space. The bathroom was not too large either, but everything worked nicely. The bar in the lobby is a real life-saver at night, and the concierge has been quite helpful in providing a power adapter (do NOT think of traveling through Japan with a professional adapter with the central safety plug, almost no plug in Japan has the right socket for that!).

The one thing that was a bit annoying was the WiFi: the sign-in only worked with Internet Explorer and as a matter of fact I find unacceptable that hotel WiFi is charged, it is such a commodity that it should be included in the room rate. Moreover, the staff at the reception didn't immediately figure out I was a Gold member and did not immediately offer a room upgrade.

Overall though, I would definitely stay at the Hilton again, highly recommended!",4,2014/08/16
1,REDACTED,en,2036,"Due to a change of plan we were looking for last minute accommodation in Tokyo and found a last minute deal at the Hilton. It was incredibly good value, we had a luxurious and large suite on the 21st floor for three days. It is very well situated 7 mins from Shinjuku rail station which is handy for going to and from Mount Fuji. The airport bus also stops at the hotel which as first time visitors to the city is an easy option, after a long haul flight with children. Negotiating the tube and trains took us a bit longer to master. The main negative was having to pay $10 a day for wifi in the room, free everywhere else we stayed. The breakfasts were also very expensive but there are plenty of cafes nearby.",5,2014/08/14

The room was very large with stunning views across Tokyo. Overall the room and the bathroom were in good condition and very clean. However for the price (£855 for 4 nights) I would have at least expected to have free wifi in the room, which was not the case. I had to pay quite a lot on top for the wifi. Breakfast was not included in the price of the room either. On one occasion I ordered room service, which was fast but again overly expensive.
Overall a great hotel for a visit to Tokyo, but beware of extra cost of wifi and expensive hotel food.",4,2014/08/11

We were given discount by the receptionist on breakfast because we are staying here for 8 days. The breakfast starts at 5, but only bread available at that time. Rice, eggs and other dishes are only available from 6.30 onwards. 

I hope the hotel management can look into this and perhaps can make rice and other food available at 5 am for guests planning to have an early breakfast.

Special mention for the lobby café/bar which is spacious and pleasant, with ample variety of food and drink throughout the day and very attentive service - a great place to meet colleagues and friends or just to hang out and refresh between Tokyo experiences. Easy access to the subway and convenient shuttle bus to Shinjuku station also make this a good home base for exploring.",5,2014/08/09

Executive floor rooms were spacious, comfortable, spotless and quiet. Hotel also has a free shuttle service as well as bus service to the airport.

1,REDACTED,en,2045,Very nice cosmopolitan property close to many business and the shinjuku train station. Service was excellent - I had a problem with my hotel room at check-in - bathroom had a very strong smell - they immediately sent somebody to verify and they upgraded me to a suite - which was very comfortable. The regular room size is very small - which is what could be expected for Tokyo - however it did feel tight....more like an NYC hotel room. Breakfast was very tasty - room service prompt and high food quality. Close to two very nice parks to stroll around.,5,2014/08/08
1,REDACTED,en,2046,"This is my 5th or 6th stay at this hotel and it is by far the best day I've had so far. I think the hotel has gone through an extensive renovation as everything seems quite new.

The staff are exceptional and willing to help with a smile every time I ask for something. And when I check in Ms. Kawaiji, is happy to upgrade me to a Hilton 'Tower' suite.

And it is a massive room. I large living room area with all the amenities you would expect from a Hilton property and lovely king size bed and modern yet small bathroom.

Each day I alternate between having breakfast in the executive lounge which is complementary as a Hilton diamond member or in the large restaurant downstairs.

It is a pleasure every morning to go to the gym and be greeted by the exceptional staff, who never forget my name or room number.

In the evenings I enjoy the Sake from the executive lounge - my only issue is the lack of variety with the food offerings. Nonetheless the staff are consistently friendly and eager to help and assist.

A pleasant stay.",4,2014/08/08

1,REDACTED,en,2048,"This was our second visit to this property and this time around we had a room on the 38th floor. 

As before we found all the staff to be both friendly and efficient in carrying out their duties. Staff we spoke to spoke English well. We always were glad to return to this hotel after our days out and we found our room to be both spacious and quiet. We ordered room service one evening and the meal was nicely presented. The bed we needed for our son was both fully made up with bedding (thank you for doing that as this does not always happen in some other hotels) and in our room prior to our arrival.

We ate breakfast in the Marble lounge daily and there was a wide choice of items to suit both Japanese, Chinese and Western tastes. There is an Italian buffet in the evenings.

On arrival and departure into Narita airport we again used the Friendly Airport Limousine bus company service. They were again reliable and the bus left on time.

This hotel links via Hiltopia (go down the steps next to the Marble lounge) to both Nishi Shinjuku and Tochomae stations on the subway lines. From either point it is quite easy to get around Tokyo. There is a shuttle bus (that was always in demand) for people who want to use this to get into Shinjuku. Otherwise its a ten minute walk on level ground. 

When we return to Tokyo we will be happy to stay here once again. Thank you for giving us a great stay.",5,2014/08/07
1,REDACTED,en,2049,I stayed at this hotel during New Years Eve and a number of days following. The room is a decent size and had a great view of the Tokyo skyline. The interior did seem a bit dated however this did not take away from the experience. The lobby seemed to be very lively with live performances on almost every day. The hotel is connected to a number of subway stations via underground passage and it's a bot a 15 minute walk to Shinjuku.,5,2014/08/04
1,REDACTED,en,2050,"I stayed at the Hilton Tokyo as a stopover in Tokyo on my holiday trip. Checking in late at night, I find the staff to be very attentive, professional,polite and spoke good English. Room quality was excellent and provided all the comforts I would want after a long flight. There were other facilities available such as your gym, tennis courts, japanese bath,etc. which are all well maintained and staffed by very helpful employees. Also the buffet breakfast in the morning was delightful. Please keep up the good work.",5,2014/08/03
1,REDACTED,en,2051,"Our family of four was scheduled to take a cruise around Japan on June 11, 2014. Because our flight was delayed by almost 24 hours we missed the ship and had to spend two nights in Tokyo before we could catch up at the next port. I booked two rooms at the Hilton using HHonors points. We are Hilton Diamond members and expected a solid Hilton performance, but this hotel was outstanding. The rooms were larger than expected, staff was wonderful, subway access right under the hotel. One of the top five Hilton executive lounges in my experience, with a huge array of western and Japanese dishes, fresh squeezed orange juice at breakfast and an extremely attentive staff. Would recommend highly.",5,2014/08/03
1,REDACTED,en,2052,"Thank you Hilton Tokyo for taking care of my parents. I book for a room for them as a token of gratitude. I had many other hotels choice in Tokyo but I am glad I chose Hilton for my parents.

They truly enjoyed breakfast at the executive lounge, staff was so attentive and good food and great view, they couldn't thank enough for what they received.

The room they stayed was very comfortable, after they got back from yakatabune dinner cruise, they rested very well.

Check out process was smooth as well. They called me from the room that they were checking out, within 15 mins, I received a copy of billing to my email inbox from the hotel as I left my credit card information at the front desk to charge everything to me for their stay.

Thank you for helping me to give a nice gift (good stay at a nice hotel) to my parents. I knew I can count on Hilton service to take care of them.

My only wish for Hilton (not just Tokyo) is a free wifi in a guest room. Since I was always getting one for free as a Diamond/Gold member benefit, I didn't think how inconvenient it was not having a free wifi. It's 2014. All other hotels I stayed around the world had free wifi. It's about time Hilton join the club and offer free wifi to all staying guests.",5,2014/08/02

1,REDACTED,en,2056,"Excellent hotel, arrival was met with very helpful staff who would carry the bags for you across the lobby if you wanted. Rooms were clean and tidy although bathrooms were a little small but functional. We asked for connect rooms and we got it but had to pay extra because one room was priced higher and they didn't have any standard connecting rooms but you get what you pay for and I have no complaints about the rooms, staff and dining. We had breakfast included and it was a 
magnificent buffet. The hotels main restaurants were going through renovation so if you wanted a little fine dining you had to go elsewhere but the buffet restaurant was more than adequate if you wanted to stay in. Room service was good and the food excellent. The hotel is situated a 10 minute taxi ride to shinjuku MRT but the hotel offers a free shuttle to the station every 20 minutes. You can take the hotel elevators to the basement where it's a 10 minutes walk to NISHI-SHINJUKU station. Being our first time to Tokyo our experience was fantastic and we left Tokyo wishing we had stayed a few extra days. Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014/07/30

Lounge upstairs was reasonable, despite being a platinum no upgrade was available. Staff spoke excellent english and were helpful and efficient.",4,2014/07/30
1,REDACTED,en,2058,"Stayed here with my wife on the final leg of our Japanese holiday September 2013. We splashed out a bit on this one and had one of the better rooms (at a huge discount but still pricey). We were on the 25th floor and the view was stupendous - normally we are not the slightest bit concerned about having a 'room with a view' but in this case I take it all back. We were so impressed that we decided to take our first meal in Tokyo in our room. This was actually very reasonably priced and I'm sure if we had eaten in a restaurant with the same vista we would have paid through the nose. The room facilities were exceptional, fluffy dressing gowns or traditional Japanese ones, and all the potions etc you could wish for. All the staff were incredibly attentive and courteous. It was just great having the free shuttle to Shinjuku station and a real boon after a hard day's sightseeing. We actually felt like rock stars.",5,2014/07/28
1,REDACTED,en,2059,"Stayed in this hotel for our first time visit in Japan. We were upgraded to the executive tower suite on the 38th floor. We had a million dollar view both day and night. Great service, friendly and helpful staff. Everybody speaks English (at least everybody try). Our suite was impeccable. Very clean, and spacious. 5 of us in the family fit. Everything is convenient around the hotel. Free shuttle to Shinjuku Station. Restaurants, shopping, Metropolitan Gov't bldg., all within walking distance. Great place to stay. Highly recommend it.",4,2014/07/28
1,REDACTED,en,2060,"This is one of the best Hilton's we've ever stayed in, wonderful bustling foyer area (sometimes a little too busy but that's Tokyo for you!) and the rooms were a good size for Japan, nicely finished. The location is perfect with a very handy shuttle to Shinjuku station that we used every day. Frankly this hotel would get 5 stars if it wasn't for my pet hate which is when a place holds it's guests to ransom for their on site amenities. The prices in the foyer restaurant are just ridiculous, one late night we didn'd have the time or energy left to go out so ate in there and I paid 1800 Yen for fish & chips with the smallest portion of fish I'd ever seen - we were also hustled out of the restaurant after our meal as apparently the staff were keen to close (it was only about 9.30pm). The bar in the hotel is lovely but again prices just too much to justify more than one drink there - they charge the same as the New York bar in the Park Hyatt except you don't get amazing table service and fantastic views of Tokyo! I'm sure the hordes of business people through the hotel every week don't care but it's a bit much for you're average couple of family travelling.

Thoroughly recommend this hotel though, for Tokyo the nightly rate we paid wasn't actually too bad and you can fairly easily go out in Shinjuku for more modestly price food and drink.",4,2014/07/25
1,REDACTED,en,2061,"You can expect great service typical of Hilton hotels. The staffs are nice and attentive to your needs. Hotel is near NishiShinjuku Subway Station of the Tokyo Metro Line and close to lots of eateries and shopping centers.

Room spacious, 2 TVs & great views from 38th floor. Bathroom ok size but found it a bit of a struggle to get into the bath to take a shower.
Exec Lounge was big but often crowded. Staff always friendly & helpful. Breakfast in lounge was adequate but high light was evening drinks & snacks.
In good area with plenty of restaurants in surrounding buildings.",4,2014/07/23
1,REDACTED,en,2063,"This is one of the most convenient hotels that i have stayed. To start off, the hotel itself looks like has been renovated as from outside it looks a bit old, but you would be surprised when you get into your room. Colorful room, with Japanese window and a very large rooms for a Japanese standard. The only draw back was the concierge staff were a bit rude and so were some(not all) of the front office staff. Apart from the rooms, the other best thing is you have free shuttle to the central part of the town, Shinjuku, where you can go to shopping...food..or even the main Shinjuku subway station. The shuttle service is available till 930PM in the night.",5,2014/07/23

1,REDACTED,en,2065,"Simple, relatively compact and clean room. I was in a room with two singles on 24th floor facing the backside of the hotel which actually had a little bit of a view in the distance as the front side of the hotel has several office towers blocking much of the city view. The room is clean with a simple layout, not sure on how recent the rooms are however room, furniture and fixtures fairly recent. strong water pressure. Very nice breakfast spread in the main lobby dining room and very good service as in many places in Tokyo. Lounge food also very nice, not the full more comprehensive spreads of the Conrad near the tsukiji market (or Conrad HGK) but still very nice. 

A few key points for this hotel:
- Access to the subway system (Shinjuku station) directly from the hotel or a walk from outside if you would like - about 15-20 min. fast walking to subway station (I did not time myself but that is my guess - whatever the case relatively short walk)
- Nice breakfast
- Compact, simple, clean and modern rooms, quiet a/c
- Lounge staff and dining room staff all very helpfull and pleasant 
(I had no specific issues or requests)
- approx. 37 floors , kind of a semi-circle shaped building
- No steam sauna, only dry sauna (the Conrad Tokyo has a stomping good steamroom)
- Great location in Tokyo - about 20 minute walk from what i would consider a very happening area in Tokyo yet a quick walk back to the quiet business district where the hotel is located - the immediate blocks around the hotel are primarily office towers.


Only stayed here and the Conrad in Tokyo, both great, Conrad complete different area. I preferred Shinjuku area and i had no specific needs to be in any particular district.",4,2014/07/21
1,REDACTED,en,2066,"Despite the sticker shock, overall, a very positive experience. Even when you know everything is more expensive in Tokyo, you may feel a bit of a sting when you check into this very welcoming, big hotel. And it's not that the prices are unreasonable; rather, the bill grows big quickly, especially if you're converting yen to dollars in your mind with every purchase. Still, the rooms are quiet, clean, sleek and modern; you'll breathe a huge sigh of relief when you close the door on a hectic day in Shinjuku. That walk to the station may cause you to break a sweat, and yet it may not be worth it to pay for a taxi that sits in traffic. HIlton provides lots of reasons to return.",4,2014/07/18
1,REDACTED,en,2067,"Always a good place to relax out of the busy Tokyo life. A little bit of a walking distance below ground to Shinjuku station but doable. The staff there are always professional, the rooms have always been clean. Overall great place, and will continue to stay there.",4,2014/07/16
1,REDACTED,en,2068,"My family and I stayed at the Hilton in Shinjuku Tokyo for a week. The hotel lobby can get busy at times, but never to the point of discomfort though. The staff are very helpful and always willing to help. The hotel is closely situated to the station and shops in Shinjuku and offers a free shuttle bus service regularly to the station. We stayed in the Junior suites which are very spacious and pleasantly furnished, although the bathroom is small. The hotel swimming pool is also small, although sufficient for a quick dip. The restaurants on the second floor were closed due to renovations, so the only restaurant we ate in was the Marble lounge. The food was nice but expensive. Luckily there are several decent restaurants in the area that we enjoyed for less than half the price that we paid at the hotel. Paying $10 for a bottle of 250ml Coke when you order room service is very expensive when you can get the same drink for $1.50 from the convenience store in the Hiltopia shopping centre next to the hotel. Overall, good location, good service, expensive restaurants.",3,2014/07/16

Suite was not a real suite, as it has only one (big) room (sort of separated into two areas, bedroom and living room), and not so big bathroom. But room was new, clean and perfectly comfortable.

1,REDACTED,en,2071,"I agree with the other reviews, one of the absolute very best Hiltons. As a frequent business traveller I take professional service for granted from five star hotels like RC, MO and Peninsula, etc. However, what really makes a hotel different from one and another is the people who work there.
We just got back from a short stay at HIlton Tokyo and had one of our best time ever at a hotel anywhere in the world, especially we have a special needs child with autism. With a brief note to the management of the hotel prior to our trip, we're quickly contacted by Mr. Ohira-san, Assistant Front Office Manager whom looked after us from the moment we checked-in until the day we checked-out, even on his day-off he ensured that other staff will take care of us. 
We strongly recommend this hotel to any parents with special needs children. Staff are extremely caring, even though not many will understand what autism means, but we do sense that staff tried to accommodate our needs as much as possible. 

A big thank you to Mr. Ohira-san, Mr. Williamson, Ms. Jacobe and Ms. Maia for your hospitality. We'll definitely return should the opportunity arise again. 

THANK YOU",5,2014/07/14

Great service, good restaurant and a great Executive lounge makes it a nice stay.
Use their free shuttle to Shinjuku and then the Airpoert express train to Narita or take the Airport Limousine buss that stays at the hotel, very easy.
Gym and SPA are also very nice with Sauna, hot and cold spas and a indoor swimmingpool. Would have been nice with a outdoor relax or lounge area.

Gym is not overly large, but it is ok for a couple of days. Pool is tiny though and only indoors.
Hotel is very well located in shinjuku which offers a wide range of possibilities to shop, eat and nightlife activity. Easy access to main underground lines and the train station.
One downside: most restaurants in the hotel are closed as they are being refurbished, open in autumn again. Think this is why we got executive upgrade.",4,2014/07/13
1,REDACTED,en,2075,"My family and I stayed here for 8 days while I was in town for work. I travel 4 months out of the year for work and this hotel was the best I've experienced on all points. We got upgraded to a newly remodeled suite which was very tastefully done. Super quiet rooms, great bathroom set up, very comfortable bed, fast elevators. Having diamond status, we had access to the executive lounge which had a great selection and the staff was extremely accommodating. The entire staff was always spot on from the doormen to the concierge. The hotel is perfectly located in Tokyo - super close to the great shopping of Shinjuku but just far enough away to not have a lot of tourist traffic. The only downside was the pool which was pretty tiny and the water heavily chlorinated. A very minor complaint and certainly not worth taking a point off for. I would stay here again without hesitation and, especially now that the yen is not super strong, come back to the happily priced shopping in Tokyo.",5,2014/07/12
1,REDACTED,en,2076,"My family of four stayed at the Hilton in Shinjuku back in April. I decided to splurge and get the Corner Hilton Tower Suite. The room was awesome with amazing views and we had access to the Executive Lounge, which was one of the best hotel lounges we've ever experienced.
A free shuttle runs every 20 min. to Shinjuku station, but honestly it's a really nice walk (assuming you don't have lots of shopping bags!). Plus, Shinjuku is a really nice and pretty part of Toyko so it was pleasant to explore the surrounding area.
Service, of course, was top notch. This was the best Hilton we've ever stayed at and would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Tokyo.",5,2014/07/12
1,REDACTED,en,2077,"Deluxe Room is comfortable and spacious. Bed is firm but some people may find the pillows too soft. There was a welcome tray of sweet berries and a pair of nicely made crane origami. I like the safety consideration in the bathroom where floor has 'wood grain' tiles to improve its non-slip characteristics. 
Reception was friendly, courteous and efficient typical of Japanese service. Also English-speaking. At check-out, there were some discrepancies with the bill but the staff listened patiently and after quick consultation with the supervisor, removed the discrepancies - no questions asked.
Breakfast is at the St George's Bar. Buffet spread of standard dishes daily - egg station, Japanese breakfast - porridge, rice & other condiments, International breakfast - cereals, bread/pastries, baked beans, bacon, other cooked dishes, fruits, fruit juices, yoghurt.
We were there during rainy season so hotel concierge provided umbrellas on request.
We didn't have time to try out the fitness room, indoor swimming pool and outdoor tennis courts. 
WiFi is not complimentary and have to re-connect when moving between rooms (guest rooms, function rooms and lobby)

1,REDACTED,en,2082,"This is a good Hilton, rather large but not too impersonal. The rooms are good standard Hilton size rooms. As I diamond honors member I wasn't upgraded but was given access to the executive lounge which included a very nice buffet breakfast. 

The first room I had was next to the lift shafts so I could hear the lifts going up and down all night. I asked to move the following day and the staff were very helpful. They were full so could not move me that moment but changed my room for me during the day. They took all my luggage and my clothes hanging in the wardrobe and even took some notes I had made on a pad on the desk and placed them on my new desk! Great service and the new room was fine. 

Location is ok. Its about a 10 minute walk to Shinjuku Station but its linked to Nishis Shinjuku Metro if you are desperate not to walk. Close to the Tokyo Metropolitain Government Building. 

The concierge recommended a great pizza place about 5 minutes walk away in the basement of the Nomura building.

Everyone here is extremely friendly and always smiling. They will bend over backwards to help you. The concierge desk made dinner and show reservations for us with ease. They even got us a small freezer for my son's ice pack because he hurt his ankle. One day we got back from touring and our room had not been cleaned yet. The woman at the front desk who checked us out at the end if our stay was still apologizing for it six days later.

If you are a Hilton Gold or Diamond card holder, you get the amazing breakfast buffet for free, in addition to free in-room wifi and use if the executive lounge on the 37th floor, offering great views of Tokyo. They also run a free shuttle to a Shinjuku Station which is only about 10 minutes away. There is also a metro line in the basement of the hotel!

The rooms are a tad small but the bed is very comfortable. The bathroom is adequate and the shower is very good. Of course, Japanese toilet bowls are awesome with all the gadgets of them.

1,REDACTED,en,2084,"Stayed here for 2 nights. 

This place is a big, impersonal business/convention type hotel in the midst of the financial district. The staff speaks English well, but there is no sense that you are anything but a number. 

Location-wise it's probably great if you're there for business. As a leisure traveler, it was not really convenient to anything, and as we were there on a weekend, lots of the shops and small lunch places around the hotel were closed. There is a shuttle bus to Shinjuku station, but it's a good 10 minute ride. It doesn't sound like a lot, but when you add in having to wait around for it (it runs every 20 minutes), if you don't hit it right, it can take 30-35 minutes from the station to your room. 

The lobby area is large and CROWDED. This was particularly a problem at breakfast as the line to get into the buffet breakfast was long. Also, lots of bumping elbows trying to get to the food. Also, because of the line of people waiting to eat, I did not feel like I could relax and read my paper. I did it anyway, but I was a little uncomfortable. I wish I knew about the dining options on the 2nd floor....I would have avoided the crowded breakfast buffet scene for a little relaxation.

Room itself was nothing special...just your typical slightly dated Hilton property. There was a problem with the faucet, and when I called front desk, a repair man came right away. That was appreciated.

PROS: 
-free shuttle to Shinjuku stations
-Incredible breakfast buffet spread
-many dining & nightlife options near hotel

CONS:
-very large, impersonal ambiance
-for leisure traveler, being in a business district means having to bus or cab to any of the sites
-rooms are slightly dated

WOULD I STAY HERE AGAIN?
No. Only reason I stayed here in the first place was because I am a Hilton Honors member and wanted the points.",3,2014/07/05
1,REDACTED,en,2085,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Hilton Tokyo in Shinjuku and had a wonderful time, with the staff taking amazing care of us.
The location was excellent, far enough from the busy areas to be quiet, but not so far that you had to walk very long to get anywhere.
The JR station was about a 10 minute walk, or there was a free shuttle service. There was also direct underground access to two Metro stations from within the hotel, which made getting around very easy (especially when it was cold and wet outside).
The restaurants were excellent, but admittedly a little pricey. Still, the Japanese restaurant had easily the best tempura I have ever eaten, and the teppanyaki was amazing as well! We also found time for the strawberry lunchtime buffet one day, which was awesome too!
The room was wonderful. Loved the shower (and the shower gel), the room had a decent view, and it was lovely to come back at the end of the day and find free water bottles waiting for us. It was always a nice surprise. The yukata robes and the comfy bed were also great.
The best part of it all, though, would have to be the staff especially Nakamura-san on the concierge desk. They were amazing from the moment we arrived. We stayed for our wedding anniversary, and our room had a welcome card wishing us congratulations. When we had our anniversary dinner they gave us a cake and clapped when we blew out the candles. The concierge were wonderful, giving us ideas and recommendations every day about things to see and places to eat in the different areas.
We were genuinely sad to leave, and cannot wait to go back.",5,2014/07/04

Easy access from the subway, I took exit C8 and it brings you right up in to the hotel lobby. Of course I was upsold to the Executive Club, but it really is worth it. Having tea and coffee facilities available (decent quality too), some snacks and the hearty happy hour is well worth it when you couldn't be bothered heading out for a quick beer. The only niggle is having to pay for internet, which is all part of the upsell to Executive of course. But when you stay at a premium hotel expect to pay premium prices.",5,2014/06/30
1,REDACTED,en,2088,"I stayed here with my siblings while traveling in Tokyo, and our experience was, overall, very pleasant. From the Narita Airport, we took the airport limousine bus to HIlton Tokyo in Shinjuku. The bus dropped us off in front of the hotel, which was pretty convenient as it saved us the trouble of looking for the hotel or getting lost in Tokyo on our first day. 

Check in, however, was not really as quick and easy as we expected. Reception had a problem with my brother's online reservation, and it took a good 30 minutes before we were able to get to our room. This wasn't much of a problem though as the hotel's lobby proved to be a very comfortable waiting area.

We booked a Twin Hilton Room, and the room we were assigned was very clean and beautiful. It was quite roomy, too. There were three of us staying in the room, and the space was adequate to fit all of us in. Our beds and pillows were also very comfortable, and the view from the window was nice. There's a tub in the bathroom and a working bidet, which was a huge plus for us, and water supply was strong even if our room was on the higher floors. Air-conditioning had also never been a problem during our stay. 

Except for the check-in issue, the hotel's service was decent. The reception staff can effectively communicate in English, and the complimentary bus shuttle service to Shinjuku Station was frequent and reliable. Housekeeping made sure to always clean our room and turn down our bed every day, and our complimentary bottles of water were always replenished even if we did not touch them. Check-out was also a breeze.

In terms of location, there's absolutely nothing we can complain about. The property is situated in a quiet area and is connected to the Marunouchi Line, making it very easy for us to travel around. There are also a couple of convenience stores nearby and some restaurants, which are open even at nighttime. Starbucks and Denny's are also just a short walk away just in case you missed breakfast. 

Our five-night stay was quite expensive, but we felt that we got our money's worth. This property is superb in many ways, and we would definitely consider staying here again.",5,2014/06/30

A shuttle to Shinjuku station every 20 minutes so convenient. We enjoyed teppanyaki at the restaurant superb quality the lobby bar always a good stop after a day out. The place to stay!,5,2014/06/28
1,REDACTED,en,2091,"Just typical of the country, there is nothing they wont do to rectify and negative comment. I loved it here. There was a small issue with the facilities in the room, after 1 call I had both front desk manager & Housekeeping managers at our door. we were sent to the executive lounge whilst it was rectified. They could not have done more to make it up to us. Aside from this instance, everything else was perfect, beautiful.",4,2014/06/27
1,REDACTED,en,2092,"We recently spent five nights at the Hilton Tokyo. All of the staff, from the young lady who greeted us at the door, to the front desk clerks, buffet staff, bell staff, and concierge -- were unfailingly gracious and helpful. Most are well-versed in English, too. The Shinjuku location is convenient for excursions throughout the Tokyo area, and the hotel's shuttle bus will take you directly to the Shinjuku rail station for those trips which would be inconvenient if you're trying to start at the nearby West Shinjuku metro station. 

The breakfast buffet has a wide variety of dishes aimed to please both Japanese and Western customers. We tried some Japanese options to widen our culinary experience. 

The rooms are thoughtfully arranged, clean, and very comfortable. The HVAC unit is easy to operate and is whisper-quiet. I appreciated the reading lights by the bed so I can read in the early hours without waking my traveling companions. We also appreciate the refrigerators, so we can store cold drinks and leftovers (we just temporarily removed the hotel's bottles that were originally in the fridge).

The concierge helped us arrange a trip to Mt. Fuji. We also learned that if you need an umbrella, you can borrow one for free from the concierge desk.

I have only two suggestions to make this a perfect property:

(1) Unlike most hotel lobbies, there is very little seating available in the lobby at the Hilton Tokyo. Nor is there any seating whatsoever in the vestibule or outside in front of the hotel. What seating is available in the lobby is not close to the doors, so it is difficult to see if your transportation or your tour guide has arrived. More seating, and more conveniently located, would be helpful.

(2) Although there were electrical outlets at the desk in our room, there were none by the beds. Travelers want electrical outlets by the beds so we can use our laptops and tablets while their batteries are recharging. 

However, these are relatively minor quibbles, so I gave the Hilton a five-star rating.",5,2014/06/26
1,REDACTED,en,2093,"We were traveling from Dallas Texas to Malaysia with a one day stopover in Tokyo. We stayed at the Hilton in Tokyo. The hotel is approximately an hour from NRT and is centrally located. Since we did not have much time to spend, the location of the hotel enabled us to take walking tour. The subway and train stations are located close for anyone wanting to travel further. I will definitely stay here again",5,2014/06/26
1,REDACTED,en,2094,"We stayed here with another couple who have used this hotel in the past. We have traveled a lot and have stayed in a wide range of hotels. This one was very reasonably-priced with breakfast, afternoon tea and evening snacks and drinks available. Our room was great. Very clean, AC system was very quiet. Lovely bathroom. We had an executive king room. Refrigerator and small safe were included. The staff was extremely polite and helpful and available.The hotel shuttle to the train station was very convenient. The whole experience made me feel like a very valued costumer. I would recommend this Hilton to anyone traveling in this area without any hesitation.",5,2014/06/25
1,REDACTED,en,2095,"While a bit on the expensive side, can't beat the location and quality of the rooms. Great English speaking presence, the breakfast buffet is very good, but expensive at 40 bucks a head. There is a Denny's and Starbucks next door which we ate at for 30 dollars total for a family of 4. Easy walk to shinjuku station, beautiful park at the corner, and short jaunt to the metropolitan government towers which you can ride to the top for a great view of Tokyo. If you can afford it,can't be beat for locale and quality. I was there with wife and two sons (11,12).",4,2014/06/24

1,REDACTED,en,2098,"I have stayed at a lot of Hilton hotels around the world and let me just say this was by far the best hilton I've had the pleasure of staying at. The staff are so helpful and attentive and eager to please. Service is top notch except in the morning during the breakfast buffet - definitely needs improvement there. The breakfast buffet is great with a good selection of western and Japanese. Make sure you try all the different smoothies and the coffee is very good. Rooms are small but very very clean and stocked with all the amenities you could need (bedroom slippers, robes, toothbrushes, etc.). 
The hotel also offers a free shuttle service to shinjuku train station but for a first trip I recommend taking it from the hotel to the station so you know where the stop is. Hard otherwise. It is possible to walk from the train station to the hotel - about a 20 min leisurely stroll. Also if you're arriving from the airport, there's a airport limousine bus that takes you directly to the hotel for cheap - very easy and convenient. 
I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014/06/23
1,REDACTED,en,2099,"This place was fabulous. It is centrally located, with a shuttle bus to Shinjuku station. It is nice and quiet and has amazing service. The executive club staff could not be faulted, and the offering they served up at breakfast and for drinks and snacks was well worth the extra! It can be busy on the weekend.

I recommend its service, being absolutely clean and quiet, with convenient contact with the staff, within anything I need. The room is spacious, 2 king-size beds, with Victorian style decor. Of course, it is Hilton, with its standard and quality control. However, the rate is reasonal for a budget traveler. Amazing! The location is a plus. In the most active and vibrant area. Great Hilton with typical Japanese excellent service. The first time I feel like being a VIP.",5,2014/06/21
1,REDACTED,en,2102,"I spent three nights at the Hilton Tokyo on business and the experience was excellent. I stayed in an executive level room and surprised at the amount of food available for breakfast and for the 6-8pm ""drinks and canapes."" My room was very stylish and immaculate. The bathroom was chic, but in this case maybe a bit less thought about style and more about function would have been good. There isn't a very convenient place to hang your towel for easy access after a shower--the towel tends to get hit with spray if you use the one inside the shower area. I couldn't hear any noise from the adjoining rooms. Instead of a coffee maker or nescafe, the room had a French coffee press, which was a treat. The exercise facilities were nice, though the pool is fairly small--only two or three people can swim in it at a time.
The restaurants in the hotel were undergoing renovation while I was there, so I can't say anything about them. However, there are a large number of restaurants in the buildings in the vicinity. The Nishi-Shinjuku metro station is a five minute walk from the hotel, which gives you access to almost anywhere you want to go in the city.",4,2014/06/21
1,REDACTED,en,2103,"I stayed at the Hilton Shinjuku for 5 nights in November 2013, for business. It was great! The reception was courteous and efficient, the room very clean and comfortable. I stayed on one of the executive floors, and their was a very nice seamless connection between the lounge and the rooms. The lounge has a great view of Tokyo, including Mount Fuji (at an angle, when the clouds allow it!). The executive lounge staff were very friendly and effective: my room was not ready when I arrived, but they took good care of me in the interim! The food and snacks available in the executive lounge was nicely varied, and certainly adequate.

The hotel has an excellent location for work at the University of Tokyo Hospitals, and also the Tokyo Metro, which is located immediately outside the hotel. Additionally, there are several all-night shops nearby where one can purchase groceries at odd hours, if need be.

The Spa is very nice, complete with hot-tub (big) and sauna (small), and a nice relaxation area.

Overall, an entirely positive experience.",5,2014/06/19

The hotel location was perfect with a station under the hotel, and a shuttle bus every 20min to shinjuku station.i had been concerned about being in a busy part of the city, but once in the hotel you didn't notice.
The gym, sauna, japanese style bath and pool perfect at the end of a busy day.

I strongly recommend this hotel.",5,2014/06/17
1,REDACTED,en,2106,"After a long flight from Chicago, we arrived at 1am. Hotel was clean, room was clean and sufficient for our 3 hour stay. Dropped our bags and went to the Lobby bar for some food. Service was horribly slow, so don't expect much here. Went back to the room to catch up on some emails and the internet was not working, and the front desk was completely unable to assist in fixing it. Time was short, so we showered and left. Good location, and would stay again if we had more time, but I certainly would avoid the bar for food/drink in the future.",3,2014/06/16

Excellent service all around, entire staff helpful, bus service to the train station that leaves every 20 min, and nice western style room with great view of the city. Hotel is far enough from the bustle of Shinjuku, yet close enough to find great food. Very nice park close by for early morning walks when you have jet lag. I cannot imagine staying anywhere else when visiting Tokyo!!",5,2014/06/15

1,REDACTED,en,2109,"The Hilton offers superb customer service. After a long flight we managed to get an early check in. The rooms are great we had a king bed with 2 rollaway beds for kids which were all really comfortable.Bathroom had spa & the kids loved the heated toilet seat with all the extra functions! We couldn't get our padlock to open on 1 of the suitcases we phoned main desk & they had picked bag up & had lock sawn off & bag returned in 10 mins! Hotel is in great location, use shuttle bus to get to main JR station which takes 10mins max. We had bought JR line passes prior to arriving in Japan & train station really busy but system is very easy to use & you feel safe. Shopping arcade below hotel for cheaper alternative for snacks. Gym & pool great. Hotel lounge expensive for wine-$28 for very small glass but service was great,they went out of their way to make milk shakes for the kids. Only negative comment is reception gets busy and not enough seats for people to just sit and relax whilst waiting to check in or out. Go into Shibuya at night to experience the night life - amazing vibe & you feel safe even with the kids! Good shopping there as well. Overall loving Hilton Tokyo!",4,2014/06/14
1,REDACTED,en,2110,"Service is the name of the game at the Tokyo Hilton, every member of staff seem to want to do their best to help you and they all speak excellent English, it gives you the feel good factor. We stayed in a Hilton King room the room we had had been recently refurbished, it was a good sized room and the new design using glass and screens to separate the bathroom gives you a sense of extra space. It seems odd to mention this but the toilet with the heated seat and built in bidet is amazing. The breakfast buffet is fabulous with a fantastic selection and excellent service. 
On an unrelated personal issue we had to get in touch with the management and their response was excellent, the issue was dealt with in an excellent fashion, thank you Mr Williamson. 
As an example of service I called and asked if they had any scales that I could use to weigh my luggage, these were brought to my room in a matter of minutes, excellent. 
The hotel is very well placed for public transport and a Metro station on the Maranuchi line is accessed from the hotel basement.
You can book a Limo Coach from the hotel to the airport and it's a very good service straight from the hotel to the airport and your luggage all looked after for you.
If I have to say anything negative and I always will on this issue, it's 2014 and in room WiFi should be free so catch up Hilton Hotels.",5,2014/06/13

The hotel has free transport every 20 mins to Shinjuku Station from where one can access the metro to all areas in Tokyo. Staff at hotel are brilliant and very helpful. Tokyo is a lovely city with lovely parks, numerous shopping areas and places to eat reasonably priced. A must is to go down to the fishmarket in the morning where one can experience fresh shushi which was fantastic. There are numerous trips one can take for the day out of Tokyo, a recommendation is the day trip to Mount Fuji, then cable car to Owakudani volcanic valley - Hakone and boat trip on Lake Ashi. For the return journey back to Tokyo one can return back by bus or travel back on the bullet train which is an experience not to be missed.",5,2014/06/11

The Lobby is great, very lively during the day. Check in was very friendly and helpful. The room was fantastic, great view, spacious and a nice bathroom (divided à la japonaise into bath/shower room and toilet/sink. a Little narrow). We had breakfast in the room, perfect. 
There are Shops in the Underground area with coffee shop, boutiques and a convenience store which doesn't sell cigarettes. For that you Need to go to the Hyatt opposite. 
The Bar is very nice, good Drinks, but Closes quite early, after 1 am no Chance.
I noticed outside that the japanese flag in front of the building was old and ripped off and the red Color was orange by the sun already. I mentionned that twice to the staff at Concierge, but nothing happened the days after during our stay. I think the Hotel should care about this more.",5,2014/06/11
1,REDACTED,en,2113,"I stayed here last year on vacation, and this time, for work, so will be writing from a slightly different perspective

Arriving at Haneda airport, i found the airport bus that takes me directly to the Hilton, for about $10. If you take a taxi, i think that's about $80. The downside to the bus is that it only comes once every hour, and it took 20mins just to pick up all the other passenger from 2-3 other terminals after me. After that it was about 45mins to downtown

Hilton is on the quiet side of Shinjuku. The crowded side is where Shinjuku JR station is, and the hotel provides a shuttle bus that gets you there in less than 10mins

Check-in was ok, though not perfect. I heard about some renovated rooms and asked for 1 of those, and alas my request was denied. So i got an old room, designed and built in the 1990s, and not very pleasant to look at. The toilet of course has no shower, just the safety hazard bathtub which i dislike very much. There was also no complimentary water provided, so i had to buy my own. But on the 4th day of my stay, suddenly, complimentary bottled water appeared. so i felt cheated after that

On the day of my arrival, i was also disappointed to find out the hotel room tv has barely any sports channels, and nothing is showing the french tennis open final. Another disappointment

The gym and pool are smallish, but serviceable. So is the sauna. And like the room, everything just looks worn and old, and all style and design are dead

The breakfast restaurant and spread are ok, but rather odd it seems to be in the lobby coffee lounge. Some people trying to eat on a small coffee table just looks strange. Perhaps it's because they are renovating the entire 2nd floor restaurant complex above, which will re-open in november

The in-room dining menu has the tiniest list of options for japanese food, just 2 options - katsu-don and tempura udon. No sushi etc.. Both were ok

I later found out the hotel has an underground link to a Metro station/line (different from the JR line), and there are also sundry shops, barber, medical clinic, and shops selling clothes and stuff. Nothing impressive though

Overall, a very dated hotel with 0 hardware wow factor and should be rated 3 stars. The japanese service upped it to 4",4,2014/06/10
1,REDACTED,en,2114,"Stayed from May 22 - 26, 2014. Check in and out was very efficient. Concierge was very helpful and accommodating although there was one concierge who gave us the wrong information about bus reservations going to Mt. Fuji. Very convenient location, with shops within walking distance. From the Narita airport, there is an airport bus limousine which stops directly in front of the hotel. Same for going back to the airport. Airport Limo reservations required. There is also a hotel bus shuttle going to and from Shinjuku train station. Room was very clean. Free wifi only available in the hotel lobby.",4,2014/06/10
1,REDACTED,en,2115,"The first thing I noticed as soon as I walked into this hotel was the nice scent, very similar to my favorite (but discontinued) The Vert Green Tea Eau de Toilette from L'Occitane. This scent has a calming effect and that is what I noticed immediately. At the front desk counter, I stopped all the conversation and enjoyed the nice scent for a while. The front desk person said they use aroma oil called green tea. Thank you Hilton for helping me feel at home as soon as I walked in.

Staff at the executive lounge was excellent. When I asked one staff about the fish market (in Tsukiji), he provided me all the information I needed, and the next day at breakfast, he remembered our conversation and made sure to follow up on my visit to the market.

What made the this Hilton more than any other hilton was after the check out. I reserved the bus to the Narita airport and watched the bell staff handled passengers' luggage. Two or three people separately checked, double checked and triple checked all the passengers reserved the seat was on board and luggage was loaded against the printed list they had from the front desk. I normally sit on the window seat where they load luggage to ensure my suitcase was loaded to the bus. I realized I don't have to worry about missing luggage here at Tokyo Hilton. This made me at ease. Assuring they take care of the guests after we checked out the hotel. The door man was giving hard candy to the passengers for the trip. Bus ride to the airport is not short. They know we could all use small candy during a long bus ride to the airport. 

There were several other small things they did. It may be a such a small thing but this is the Japanese omotenashi. Sure this hotel is expensive, but the service we received was more than what we paid. I reserved a room again at this hotel, this time for my parents. I want them to enjoy the service I received and really feel relaxed, knowing they will take care of the guests.",5,2014/06/10
1,REDACTED,en,2116,"This is my second stay here and I had a wonderful stay, especially now I know my way around. Check in and check out was super efficient, although when it gets busy it is really hard to know how to line up because people just stand around and use own courtesy system as to who was first and so on. I wish they would put in some sort of line up system otherwise, guests are just standing around in a makeshift line. Everything else was fine, and I would stay here again.",4,2014/06/10

My biggest praise would be the service at the Hilton Tokyo. Sam Fan, the manager at the front desk was very generous and kind upon my check-in and helped me into the best room for the price that was available. 

As, not only a Hilton Honors card member, but an investor in the stock, I was pleased to see the great service and quality rooms that make Hilton the only hotel that I stay at around the world.

But the clerk told me he would provide free breakfast. Only issue is my rate already included breakfast. My room on the 27th floor provided a very good view, but the room was not clean, with stained carpeting and fraying bed linen. While a nice size, it was sterile, but not in a cool minimalist way.

While the outside of the hotel was not very inviting, the inside was a different story. The lobby was spacious and had free Wi-Fi. The hotel rooms were much larger than most rooms in Tokyo. The hotel also has an acceptable gym with a pool. The restaurants in the hotel were high priced, especially the buffet/tea area in the lobby, but there is really no need to eat in the hotel given the location. In general, there were not enough places to sit in the lobby. The hotel is in a great location and easy walking distance to the Park Hyatt and Shinjuku Station.

1,REDACTED,en,2123,"I'll qualify this by starting out saying that I usually stay at the Grand Hyatt in Roppongi (but on this occasion I was unable to stay there). The Hilton is a reasonable hotel, but it's no Hyatt. The cost of the hotel was much the same as the Grand Hyatt, however the quality of the room was nowhere near as good. The room itself was a reasonable size, however the bathroom was an absolute shocker. I had expected it have something of a reasonable size and quality, however it was a shoebox bathroom with a horrible shower and a shower screen that resulted in water leaking all over the bathroom floor and around the toilet. The club lounge was relatively small, and I often found it hard to get a table for breakfast - though it did do a great fresh orange juice.

The service throughout was fine, however it wasn't great enough to make up for the problems in the bathroom.

Next time I'll be back at the Grand Hyatt, and if I have to stay in Shinjuku then I'll stay at the Park Hyatt - much better than the Hilton",3,2014/06/03

1,REDACTED,en,2127,"First stay at this establishment and based on Japanese customary, I had high expectations of service. Overall service did not disappoint too much. From luggage service, housekeeping through to breakfast, service was great.

Only slight disappointment with Hilton Tokyo was at check in, I was told that I was upgraded to a King Junior Suite Executive (originally booked Junior Suite King). Thought that was a very nice touch from the establishment until I decided to go and check out the lounge. Upon entry, we were categorically told that we was offered an ""upgrade"" to an executive floor room but not entitled to the benefits! Originally thought it may have been a communication issue at check in but corrected with some attitude from the executive Lounge receptionist that she checked with the person who checked me in and confirmed receptionist studied overseas and therefore English was not an issue. I was told by the Front Desk Supervisor & Assistant Front Office Manager that usually this is not the case but provided no explanation. To add further insult to injury, I was told if I really wanted access to the Executive Lounge, I would need to move from my King room to a Twin room! No big deal about accessing the lounge as being Gold makes it a privilege rather than a right but disappointed of not being told upfront at check in. 

Ultimately both Front Desk Manager & Assistant Front Officer manager insisted I use the Executive Lounge for the rest of my stay. At that stage I was no longer interested especially if Executive Lounge staff will have some attitude towards residents.

I was hoping to meet with the GM on site but to no avail. Hope this gets reviewed by the GM Michael W. If upgraded to an Executive room, one should also expect the benefits ... This has left a slight sour taste of Hilton Tokyo!",4,2014/06/01

The executive lounge, however, is a disaster...regularly turning people away because they are full, 20-40 minute wait to get a drink, slow and unresponsive staff. They allow way too many guests access and can't handle the traffic. Despite their claims of having a dress policy, it isn't enforced at all...resulting in people in pajamas and flip flops at breakfast.

If you plan to eat at the hotel restaurants (we didn't), be aware that several will be closed this summer for complete renovation.

Staff was great; they accepted my MiFi device before I checked in and helped me send it back upon check-out. The bell staff was able to help me fill out the luggage transfer forms to ship my snowboarding gear. The also were very helpful in making reservations to some of the restaurants months in advance.

The rooms were fine, but a bit dated. Bed was comfortable and showers were great. 

Hotel was always BUSY, at all times of the day. Location is a bit of a walk to proper Shinjuku, but the free shuttle helps. The Metro is just downstairs which is also very convenient. The executive lounge is quite large, but the size is definitely needed. Did I mention how busy it is? 

If I want to stay in Shinjuku again, I will definitely select this hotel.",5,2014/05/29
1,REDACTED,en,2131,"In our last Japan vacation we put up in Hilton Tokyo. It is very conveniently located with walking distance from Nishi Shinjuku and another Subway station. You can also walk from the Shinjuku station (10-15min walk) or take a shuttle bus from the hotel. The bus runs every 20mins. However be clear on which exit to take from Shinjuku station as it might get very confusing with numerous exits at the station.

Best way to reach from the airport is to take an airport express which will drop you at Shinjuku station and then take the hilton shuttle.

Hotel rooms are nice with all the facilities that you might need ...room has a nice view so you can sit and sip wine in the evening :)

Breakfast is good with good spread so you can enjoy. There is an Indian restaurant in the basement of the hotel itself. Its a bit on the expensive side but if you cant live without Indian food for more than 2 days like me then it is very convenient. There is another indian (japanese style indian) restaurant walking distance from the hotel which is more economical but has limited choice and is just OK on food taste.

Hotel has pick up facility from most tour operators so its very convenient if you want to take tours. It also has a convenience store in the basement so you can get your regular stuff easily.

So overall its a bit expensive property but very clean and with excellent connectivity.",4,2014/05/29

1,REDACTED,en,2133,"This was my first trip to Japan, loved it. A very nice hotel in a great location. The rooms were updated and well appointed. We had access to the executive lounge which was superb; breakfast, afternoon tea, heavy food and drinks in the evening. The service in the lounge was excellent. The Narita airport shuttle bus took us to the front door of the hotel so we did not have to think about anything. During our visit, we walked to the Shinjuku station most of the time rather than taking the hotel shuttle bus. It was only a 10 minute easy walk. There is also another metro station one block from the hotel. There are many things to do around the hotel area and the access to transit is great. Great hotel, great room, great service, and recommended.",5,2014/05/28

1,REDACTED,en,2135,"Generally good except that there is no WiFi in room (which is very uncommon in Japan) and too far a walk to Shinjuku station especially when you have made a big purchase.

Situated in the business area, not so many lights or entertainment nearby.",4,2014/05/28
1,REDACTED,en,2136,"Almost boringly high-quality Hilton international site. Room and service consistent with other Hilton business traveler properties in major international cities. On par with Hilton Paris La Defense, which is high praise indeed.

The property sits more or less above the Nishi-Shinjuku subway station, so transit can be accessed without getting out in the weather, but it is a little bit of a hike. The main Shinjuku station is a fairly short walk the other direction, and the underground there is far more entertaining. If you are heading towards the Ginza, that short walk cuts out two stops.

The room was business/executive-level, which is a step up from the standard, and seemed to be well worth the difference in cost. The room was moderately spacious, very clean, well-appointed and tastefully decorated.

In keeping with the Japanese culture of cleanliness, the in-room shower and toilet facilities were far above the normal expected even for higher-end hotels.
The shower and tub are separate but co-located, with water draining on (and into) the floor, which is a little disconcerting for Americans, but quickly overlooked because of the abundant supply of water at just about any temperature desired. Tall people (>6') will have no problems with the shower. The deep tub is shorter than the standard American version, so it's a wash (so to speak) for us tall ones.

The toilets are almost a tourist attraction in and of themselves, and verge on needing an instruction manual. Who knew ""personal time"" could be so entertaining?

The breakfast buffet was also typical of Hilton international sites, with a very good selection of locally-supplied Western and Japanese fare. The breakfast should be able to satisfy all but those with extreme dietary requirements/prejudices.

The staff was always polite and helpful. Common areas were open, airy and, as expected, very clean. There was a high-end custom chocolate and baked goods kiosk distressingly near the main desk and elevators, good enough to cause many to impulsively abandon diets and risk diabetic shock, me included.

Overall, a thoroughly excellent property in an equally excellent location.
I would definitely stay again.",5,2014/05/27
1,REDACTED,en,2137,"Cute little room with much bigger size than the local jp hotels. Just the bathroom was a bit too small. It's a bit far from the shinjuku station, 15 min walk. There were two other stations that's closer but still about 5 to 8 min walk. It could be very painful after a long day of shopping, you know what I mean right girls... Also there were only the office buildings around the hotel, no shops, no decent food. Had to walk all the way to shinjuku to find everything.",4,2014/05/27

1,REDACTED,en,2141,"This was my first trip to Shinjuku, and the Hilton and staff made my trip much easier. 

I took the Airport Limousine Bus (just search on Airport Limousine Bus Nirita Shinjuku...TA won't allow posting the actual link) which I highly recommend. The ticket each way from NRT airport was ¥3,100 (roughly $31 USD). Shinjuku is quite a distance from the airport (90-120 min), and a cab will be about ten times that cost. 

I appreciated the high-level of English spoken by the staff throughout the hotel. After having my suits packed for the 16+ hour journey to get to Tokyo, I was thrilled to find a full-sized ironing board in my room. The quality of my internet access was also very good, making FaceTime calls to the US simple. 

The hotel itself is very conveniently located to restaurants, shopping, and transportation. In my free time, I was also able to walk to Shinjuku Garden and to a nearby sword museum that were both very interesting to see. 

While not as ""adventurous"" as some non-American hotels might have been, I had enough adventures awaiting me that week as it was!",4,2014/05/26
1,REDACTED,en,2142,"We recently had a quick trip to Tokyo and decided to use up some Hilton Honors points to pay for the rooms. My initial impression was dismal. It was 4:30 in the afternoon when we arrived but 3 of the 5 rooms we had reserved were not ready. After a long flight from the US all we wanted were hot showers. 

The front desk asked us to head up to the 37th floor and wait in the Executive Lounge. WOW! What a lounge. Amazing views of Shinjuku and really well stocked with good food and drinks. In just a short while our rooms were available and we finally got to relax. The rooms were beautifully appointed, spacious and very comfortable. Showers were huge and plenty of water pressure.

Everyone we encountered from the staff including the concierge who took care of our dinner reservations was charming and helpful. The breakfast in the lounge the next morning was plentiful and delicious. 

This hotel is conveniently located on a subway line and just a 10 minute walk or shuttle ride from Shinjuku Station for Rail service including the Narita Express. There is plenty to do right in Shinuku though.

This is easily one of the nicest Hilton's I have ever stayed in and on-par with a Conrad or Ritz.",5,2014/05/26
1,REDACTED,en,2143,"Booked two Executive Club rooms and arranged an upgrade to Junior Suites as part of the Hilton Honors e-upgrade system. It was my daughters birthday and they very kindly put a box of exquisite chocolates in her room.
We found the location to be excellent, just 10-15 mins walk to Shinjuku station and the surrounding amazing nightlife. Breakfast was excellent as was the executive lounge. This is very much a 5* hotel in an area with some outstanding modern architecture. It really is worth booking an executive club room to enjoy the superb club lounge facilites. We really enjoyed our stay and really didn’t want to leave.",5,2014/05/25
1,REDACTED,en,2144,"It's a nice hotel but a bit far from the station. Shuttle bus to/from station only operates 8 am through 9:30p'ish, so you'd have to either walk for 10+ mins or take a cab ($7-$8). Room is large for a Japanese standard. 

It's located in Shinjyuku area, a super busy metro/train station. If you've been to Tokyo before, you know how busy Shinjyuku station is... You get lost easily even you speak/read Japanese. Otherwise you may want to stay in a bit less crazy area. 

The fitness center (free for guest) is a bit small for a size of the hotel. Not many options for the equipment, 5 or 6 treadmills. Shower/bathroom and sauna area is also tiny. At least it:s open 24 hrs, so it's a plus. I stay here b-caz of my HH membership.",4,2014/05/24
1,REDACTED,en,2145,"The Hilton Shinjuku is superb, the location is just perfect. Close enough to the action but just far enough away to escape.
The lobby is lively and welcoming, staff were attentive and all spoke excellent English.
Breakfast is superb and has plenty of choice.
There is a shuttle bus which whisks you off to the train station / Shinjuku centre which runs frequently. If you're arriving for the first time though, you might find it tricky to find the bus stop. We chose to jump in a Taxi which cost about £5 only. Shinjuku station is enormous and if you've got luggage.......
The only minor point was that wifi was free only in the lobby, but other than that I'd happily go back.

1,REDACTED,en,2146,"My husband and I stayed here for 6 nights and really enjoyed it as our Tokyo base. The hotel is comfortable, clean and spacious. We enjoyed the breakfast every morning - good selection and a good start to the day. 
The room was large and always clean and tidy when we came back at the end of another day in Tokyo. And the view out across Shinjuku was pretty spectacular. 
The location isn't particularly exciting. It's not far to Shinjuku which is very lively but there is a metro stop less than 5 minutes away and it was easy to get around. 
I didn't take advantage of the pool or gym but my husband did and said they were very good and from our window we could see people playing tennis on the rooftop court.
The staff were consistently friendly and pleasant.
I would recommend this for a stay in Tokyo, it's pleasant, clean, comfortable and spacious but don't expect anything original or out of the ordinary.",4,2014/05/23
1,REDACTED,en,2147,"The Hilton Tokyo is conveniently located in Shinjuku. I have stayed there on numerous occasions previously, but this stay was less than satisfactory. 

My reservation was made by American Express for a Junior Suite. I checked in in the Executive Club. As a Hilton Honors Diamond Member the reservation is usually upgraded at checkin (as per Hilton policy). There was no upgrade on this occasion and no apology that one was not available. No idea why - perhaps Hilton Tokyo doesn't like corporate policy!! Still my junior suite was both spacious and comfortable.

I used the Executive Lounge at the hotel and ordered a mojito - it arrived and was pleasant with chunks of apple in it - it certainly wasn't a mojito though. Food on offer was average. Lounge was overcrowded and those arriving later during happy hour had to wait some time for others to leave so a table could be found. Be sure to arrive at 6pm when happy hour starts to get a table / seat. Staff are helpful in the Lounge. 

Following 'happy hour' I visited St George's Bar on the lobby level with my iPad to check my emails for the day. Think again - no wifi service in the bar. The beer was good and on my second evening I ordered a mushroom risotto in the bar which was very nice. Staff are helpful.

Wifi elsewhere in the hotel and in the room works very well however.

On my final evening I sent my shoes for shoe shine at about 10pm requesting they be delivered at 6.30am the following morning as I was booked on the 7.10am shuttle bus to the airport. At 6.20am I attempted to call to have my shoes delivered early as I was ready to go to breakfast - the operator was not answering the phone, neither was housekeeping. 6.30am came and went and still no shoes and no answer from the hotel operator, housekeeping or the help line. At 6.45am I gave up and went barefooted to the Executive Club to check out and have them locate my shoes and have my bags collected from my room. Returning to my room I waited until 7am and niether my shoes had been delivered or my luggage collected. Given the diabolical mess I took my own bags to the lobby - still without shoes and asked for the duty manager. He eventually tracked down my shoes and I got on the shuttle bus with minutes to spare. What an absolute mess and no breakfast either as I had to run around instead of enjoying breakfast before I left the hotel, despite being ready to go to breakfast at 6.20am. The Night Manager brought a coffee for me to the bus and apologized. I have also received an email of apology from housekeeping subsequently.

Japanese efficiency has clearly left this hotel. Maybe be better to look at the Hyatt Regency if one is looking for a hotel in Shinjuku.",2,2014/05/23

1,REDACTED,en,2153,"Stayed in the Hilton Tokyo two nights post China/Japan cruise and wish we had had more time there. Our room had a spectacular view, loved the double shoji screens instead of dreary curtains. The staff is exceptional - reception and concierge were patient, polite. Reception was very helpful with confirming our pre=booked tours (Sunrise Tours to Nikko and half day Tokyo, terrific!). Breakfast is served off the lobby in a high ceilinged area that is very pleasant. We took the Breakfast/Dinner package and enjoyed both dinners, one in the Japanese restaurant and a buffet in the Brasserie. After two long excursions, it was a relief not to go out and search for dinner. The Japanese restaurant offers its lunch menu for dinner, apparently an abbreviated version of dinner. It was very good although we expected a dinner menu for dinner...Still a good value considering how expensive Tokyo is. The free hotel shuttle from Shinjuku Station is very handy since some tours pick up at the Hilton but drop off at Shinjuku Station. The hotel has an airport bus service (not all top Tokyo hotels do; some very fancy hotels we considered will tell you to take a taxi to another hotel to catch the airport bus!!!) which is less than $35 per person - a fabulous price.

I chose the Hilton Tokyo because it seemed a familiar & safe bet. The room prices were what I expected from a full service hotel, and we were very please with our choice. A hotel can ""make or break"" a trip, so we erred on the side of a hotel with the reputation of a Hilton.

The staff members were very helpful, answering our questions and responding to our needs in a great way. They were especially helpful in providing an understanding of the trains and subway routes.

Our room was very spacious & clean, with an updated bathroom. We did not stay on the executive level, but our room was wonderful. Wifi is available in the lobby, which is only a minor convenience & no big deal to me. I had absolutely no trouble logging on each night.

We ate the Saturday lunch buffet in the hotel. Although the price of approx. $45 USD per person was a little steep, the buffet was outstanding. We enjoyed it and have no regrets because it was such a nice dining experience.

An email sent to the Director of Operations with some constructive comments went unanswered so my overall ranking of the hotel reflects the lack of customer focus.

The only disappointment, unfortunately, is the first the thing you see, the lobby and entrance way. The lobby is dark and has low ceilings, it is full of luggage and open to a huge dinning area, people are standing around and looks more like a bus station than the lobby of a luxury hotel. 

The dinning area where breakfast is served is equally ugly and unwelcoming and open to the lobby. Although the buffet has an omelet station and a good selection of foods it is just too big and noisy and seems ""industrial"" not a pleasant spot at all.",4,2014/04/28

The front desk manager called and met us in person after a small incident of noise next to our room solved promptly. It was very professional and made us feel welcome.

The rooms were newly renovated, modern with a Japanese touch, super clean and comfortable. I had high quality mattresses at home, so I am very picky about the mattress and very consented.

The breakfast had large variety of food. ( had to admit that Shangri-la does it slightly better). We tried the afternoon tea once in the club lounge. My son loved the cakes. The pre-dinner snacks were pretty good. 

Overall, my family and my son loved the hotel and looked forward to staying more in the future.",5,2014/04/27
1,REDACTED,en,2178,"Good standard of hotel. Nice room & high levels of cleanliness. Service with a smile does not always meets customer needs, as sometimes totally inflexible (but could be culture?).Staff extremely courteous & make you feel welcome.

Hotel food good & was able to cater for my dietary needs (gluten & wheat intolerant), however dishes limited through lack of understanding of condition (I carry a Japanese food card with me from celiactravel.com), which surprised me as this was the primary reason for choosing an international hotel for our stay in Tokyo.

Worth upgrading to Executive Lounge for snacks and pre dinner drinks (6pm - 8pm) cocktails & champagne served. Snacks good, but sadly i couldn't eat anything due to almost everything containing gluten, but was still good value especially as alcohol very expensive in japan.

Breakfast buffet was excellent & we had several evening meals in the hotel f which all were of reasonable standard.

Good location for city stay, next to small park & near to metro making it easy to travel to major sight seeing sites. Metro is very cheap too.

After requesting a non smoking room I was displeased to find out we were in fact placed on a smoking floor in a 'non smoking room'. I am not one to argue without all the facts, so I briefly expressed my dissatisfaction and moved on. The room was on the 34th floor. The toxic cloud of smoke was in the air as soon as we stepped out of the elevator. Once I'm the room the smell was all but gone which was a relief. Hotel has good facilities. I used the pool and gym on a few occasions as well as some of the restaurants. We had breakfast included in our stay and I must say that it was very good. Hotel has wifi in lobby but not the rooms. A complementary mini bus is available to take you to Shinjuku station. The bus was always on time! Among all the positives there were some small distractions which made this hotel only 4 circles, such as room fixings, wall maintenance, carpet stains, etc. Try the Indian restaurant in the basement shopping centre! Very nice and reasonably priced.",4,2014/04/22
1,REDACTED,en,2187,"I found it quite hard to rate this hotel - there are so many things about it that are at the 5 out of 5 level, but a few flaws and not having enough special touches made me think that 4 out of 5 was a fairer reflection.

The hotel interiors are excellent - smart, grand, spacious and comfortable. This goes for both the communal areas - lobby, corridors, lifts etc. - and the private areas. Our room was excellently sized with fantastic amenities and a wonderful view over the city. All of the furniture and adornments had a mark of quality about them. The one disappointment with the room - which I cannot at all understand for a hotel of this quality and in this day in age - is the lack of complimentary wireless internet. We toured around Japan, staying at four different hotels, and despite this hotel being the best in many respects, it was the only one that didn't come with this. Its an easy thing for them to fix.

Overall, the services side of the hotel was very good. We drank at the lobby bar on several occasions and all staff members were professional, polite and helpful. Similarly, when we used the reception desk or concierge, we received a high standard of care. One area that they did fall a little short on was housekeeping - one day our room was forgotten altogether (we rang them and they promptly sent somebody) and one day they missed refilling teas, coffees etc. Small mistakes and not something I particularly hold against them.

We ate at the onsite Japanese restaurant and, to be honest, I considered it to be quite ordinary. I didn't think the décor and ambience matches other parts of the hotel and whilst the food was decent, I didn't walk away thinking it was amazing.

I do think that this is an excellent hotel, and one which doesn't need to change much to really be top drawer. Other than the wifi, it does most of the basic things extremely well. But, when I think back to the best hotels I've stayed at (business and pleasure), there are often small touches that mark them out from those that are merely ""very good"". This might be a welcome note with a few chocolates, or an invite to a one of the onsite premises with a complimentary drink, or a bowl of fruit or some flowers on your last day. Some of those things may not suit the type of hotel this is, but those types of touches are the things that mark out the very best.",4,2014/04/21

Each morning we were greeted again by ever smiling,friendly and always helpful staff. 
The food at the breakfast buffet was of a high quality and variety.
I loved the idea of the 'Journey Ambassador ' who also greeted us each morning with a warm welcome and have a good day. She was very knowledgable about a few places of interest and directed us accordingly.
Although a little distance from the rail station, the courtesy bus ran often and was clean and safe. It was approx 1/2 hour from them main Tokyo station (in peak hour about ¥33,000) the local Shinjuku station can link you with many other lines and rail travel is easy after you know what to do.

Lounge also serves as private front desk and concierge. Breakfast buffet was excellent with Eastern and Western selections, and an omelette station that was delightful to watch.

1,REDACTED,en,2204,"After having carefully chosen a hotel that suited my friends and i ( we were a party of 8 women), we were very happy with our choice and the four rooms that we had booked. Having checked in, we realised that none of the four air conditioners were working in any of the rooms. We informed the front desk and the following day, two of the four were alive and kicking. The following day, we complained about the other two non functioning units and some staff was sent up to both rooms and the air conditioning worked for all of one hour. After this, all the rest of our requests to get the units checked fell to deaf ears.

Many a sorries and bows later, it was the day of departure. Some more bows and further sorries but no compensation was even mentioned. I wrote about the situation in their feedback email to which i got a prompt reply from the Executive Housekeeper, once again apologising.

Well, the train has left the tracks, we have checked out and four of the eight of us spent sweaty nights in the room. 

Besides this major grievance, the staff was very friendly, attentive and the breakfast staff in particular was fantastic. The breakfast spread was pretty good and the choice was just about right. 

The location of the hotel is very good and the lobby is always buzzing with activity more so because no free wifi is offered in the rooms and most guests sit in the lobby to avail of the three hour free wifi. 

There are other minor housekeeping issues ( uncleaned glasses) that one can overlook but after having spent rack rate on each room with no special prices, we felt a bit cheated.",3,2014/04/11
1,REDACTED,en,2205,"DOI up front. I burned pretty much all my remaining Hilton points on this stay.

About a week before I arrived Hilton central dropped me from their top tier of HHonors (as per the rules, to be fair, having not stayed enough to retain top tier).

But, as I checked in, early,, the desk staff hnoured the status I had when booked, and kicked me up to an exec room.This gets you free breakfast, and lounge access, which means drinks a plenty (cocktails included) of an evening and free breakfast.

So, this review reflects that. The service offered was excellent. As were the benefits. My room had a very cofy bedroom with lots of space, but the bathroom and amenities were sparse to be honest. I had a much larger bathroom with better spec in a standard ryokan in Kii province.

If Hilton had treated me the way Hilton Tokyo did, maybe I've be staying with them more. Massive thumbs up to them, as they buck the Hilton chain trend of frankly cr*p servince.",5,2014/04/11

The bed was super comfy & furnishings & fittings were top class. Loved the bedside reading lamps which were spot on. They had a nespresso machine (3 free capsules a day). My only criticism is that the bathroom/toilet area is very cramped & the phone in bathroom cannot call out (only receives calls). By a freak accident my father was unable to open the sliding door as something had fallen against the sliding door jamming it. So he was trapped in the bathroom for an hour till I returned to the room. He was unable to open the door & couldnt call for help on the phone. Mamagement should look into this.

1,REDACTED,en,2208,"After years of doing business in Tokyo, I settled on the Shinjuku area as my home base. Given its' excellent location (nearby parks and shopping) and close proximity to the Shinjuku station (Tokyo's largest and best train station) this is how I do Tokyo. As my wife hadn't visited Tokyo in decades, she asked to join my most recent trip to China and Japan. Given my preferences she chose the Shinjuku Hilton. While not cheap, the experience was faultless. Unable to arrange for all of the nights of our trip she scheduled our last night elsewhere. This only highlighted the differences in quality and service. 

The Hilton was resort-like by comparison with the other hotel. Yes, the Hilton was significantly more expensive, but is was significantly better in every respect. It is somewhat like buying a car. Go with the cheaper model and you will end up spending much more to option it up to your liking than you would have spent on the next higher model.
The room was just about perfect. Large bed, large TV, large couch, espresso machine, great shower and tub, excellent view, great breakfast buffet, I can go on and on. After a week in China it was a revelation to have a western breakfast prepared in the true western style. No uncooked bacon or sausage. No reconstituted juices or mystery dishes masquerading as western food. No waiters afraid to come to your table in fear of an English conversation. While talking to a waiter at breakfast we had a little spill at the table. The waiter insisted we call housekeeping after breakfast and have the wet clothes cleaned on the house!

When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised with a free upgrade to the Tower Suite, which has two twin beds and a separate living room. The boys slept on the living room sofa which was quite comfortable. The hotel room was recently remodeled and has a really nice modern, clean design with lots of drawers and storage space. The bathroom is relatively small but is nicely designed and the workmanship is excellent. The boys loved the room so much and kept saying it's one of the best parts of the trip. The buffet breakfast was also excellent with a wide selection of quality food. I emailed the consiege before the trip asking transportation options from the Narita airport to the hotel. They got back to me really quickly and provided detailed information which was really helpful. There really is nothing negative I can think of. My younger son's only complains were that the swimming pool was small and they don't let a 12 year old use the gym. :-). I'd surely recommend this hotel to my friends and will stay there if we ever visit Tokyo again. Oh one more important thing is the location of the hotel is great, right in the middle of Shinjiku, next to the Central Park and the city government building. There is nothing better than visiting Tokyo the first week of April to enjoy the cherry blossom and go up to the 45th floor of the city government building to see Tokyo and Mt. Fuji.",5,2014/04/08

The only negative I could find was the relatively slow service in St George's bar.....however the cocktails were definitely worth waiting for. The raspberry mojito is delicious! However another downside is the fact that smoking is allowed in the bar. Disgusting. 

The bedrooms are modern and very well maintained and the maid service is excellent. Always done promptly and not once did I have to phone up because something hadn't been cleaned or replaced. 

As usual the hair dryer wasn't up to much....a common bug bear of mine! 

The hotel staff are very welcoming, friendly, efficient and helpful. The reception staff speak good English, so there were no issues during check in or check out.

I wanted a reliable hotel where English was spoken, and was well located. The Tokyo Hilton served that purpose well. I took the train from Narita airport to the Shinjuku Station and called ahead and boarded the free Hilton shuttle for the 5 minute ride to the Hilton. The check in was uneventful. I opted to buy an upgrade by reserving on the web site in advance for the concierge benefits and it was well worth it, since I was able to actually have both breakfast and dinner in the concierge lounge. The location could not be better since it is a short walk to the train system which connects all of Tokyo. The facility as everything I wanted, with a nice big room, and great view.

We got there ridiculously early as our flight landed at 5 AM - but thankfully they had an option to do an early check in for a small fee. They are right next door to the 'Nishi Shinjuku' metro station but for most places you'd want to go, you will probably end up changing lines in 'Shinjuku Sanchome'. That can start to get a tad bit annoying if you want to pop back to the hotel to freshen up between sightseeing trips. The are it is in is a proper business district - so if you're looking to just pop into a random restaurant off the street, you will need to walk a good few blocks or take the train. There is also a really useful shuttle bus service going to Shinjuku every 20 mins.. Overall, we were happy with our stay.. Nothing outstanding but nothing to complain about either.",4,2014/04/01
1,REDACTED,en,2217,"The Hilton Tokyo is a modern and well-maintained hotel with a spotless lobby and rooms. The immediate surrounds are offices but the bustle of Shinjuku is only 10 minutes walk away. Two metro stations are within 5 minutes walk.

Rooms are reasonably sized although the bathrooms are small for this class of hotel with an annoying shower door that should have been mounted the opposite side.

The staff were exceeding polite as is customary in Japan but the service was not very proactive and sometimes incorrect information was given.

A major disappointment was the gimmicky cordless irons. It was essentially impossible to iron more than one shirt without putting the iron back into its station and minimal steam generated meant it was difficult to remove all creases. For a business hotel this is a major fail.

The Executive Lounge had excellent views and generous evening canapés. I was impressed on check-in to find out it closed at 10pm as I seldom get to use the lounges as they’re closed by the time I return in the evening. However, within a day I was informed that the lounge would be changing to 8pm closing.

For Hilton HHonors members, the good news is a restaurant breakfast for Diamond members. Unfortunately there was no welcome “gift” of petit fours like other Hiltons but water bottles were provided.

Internet expensive at around £15 for 24 hours so used free lobby access but that is not ideal. No time to savour the pool and gym but they looked good. Food is good but really pricey. A quality Hilton. Enjoyed my stay.",4,2014/03/31

They upgraded us because it was our ruby wedding anniversary to a fantastic massive room...we loved it! Breakfast is lavish and good quality ! Drinks in hotel expensive but Tokyo is anyway, location is good near the manic shinjuku station with the free shuttle bus it's easy to get there but it's an easy 10minute walk .we would return ,only grumble is the wifi surely Hilton can give free wifi in guest rooms? If coffee shops can do it surely Hilton can?Apart from that it was great would have been 5*if free wifi in room",4,2014/03/28

1,REDACTED,en,2222,"We were in Tokyo for the marathon this year and everyone was scrambling for a hotel near the start line in Shinjuku. We could not get Keio Plaza so booked in to the Hilton instead. Having stayed at Keio before, I was happy we picked Hilton as the rooms are better and the hotel is much smaller and cosier. Location-wise, it is not as good as Keio as Keio is closer to food and Shinjuku station. Having said that, Hilton is only an additional 5-8 minute walk compared to Keio so it is not that bad. Breakfast is good - there is a generous buffet spread and they serve good bacon :). Concierge is very very friendly and helpful. They are most willing to help you with directions and recommendations. Very happy with the service. I will stay here again.",5,2014/03/22

The hotel is excellent with great food selections with an excellent location clost to Shinjuku station which when you figure out the Tokyo metro will take you anywhere you want to go fast and effeciently.

The customer service by the employees at this hotel is the best I have ever experienced, they went above and beyond the call to ensure I had a plesant stay.

The Executive Lounge on the 37th floor offers great meal selections with a fantastic view of the city and evening cocktails. 

I needed an electrical adapter for my laptop at 3am to convert from Japan socket to US, called the Customer Careline and within 5 minutes one was at the door -- at 3am local time !! What service

Employees at Hilton properties in the states should spend a few days at the Hilton Tokyo to see how Customer Service should be done.

The hotel room is spacious (executive floor), very clean and the beds are comfortable. Huge credit to Ken the chief concierge and his team, never seems to be trouble to them, from asking for directions, booking tours and restaurants, may be we ask them so many questions on our first day, they greet us with our name the next day, we stayed in Hilton Tokyo for six nights, we feel like we are going home every night after a long day out, people greet you and welcome you as soon as you walked in.

I have made over 40 visits to this hotel in 10 years and it never disappoints. They constantly look to improve and upgrade while always performing at a high level of service.

1,REDACTED,en,2238,"This is our third stay at Hilton Tokyo and this stay has so far been a disappointment. The room was not ready when we came, waited nearly two hours after a trip from Europe. Finally we got a room by the elevator and considering we asked for ""far away from the elevator"" it could have been better. The faucet only poors warm water and it is not so nice for brushing your teeth, trying the cold water floods the bathroom. The bath tub front panel is hanging so all the not-done-cleaning meets you when you enter. Luckily the city of Tokyo greats us and we can spend the time outside the hotel.",2,2014/03/06

If you prefer the train, it's also very close to the train station. It's now my favorite hotel in the Shinjuku area. And by the way, I have been able to get a very good price for this hotel through Kayak.com. Check it out.",5,2014/03/06
1,REDACTED,en,2240,"While this hotel is very nice, it ranks ""average"" to me. I've stayed at 5-star hotels, so that may be why I decided to give it an ""average"" ranking. We stayed 6 days, 5 nights.

The major issue was that we were not warned that there was major renovation going on. It made my stay really uncomfortable. While my husband was out on business, I would work in the morning either on work or school. All I heard for hours was a constant drilling, hammering or pounding. I went to the front desk after day 2 and asked about it. He said that it was going on from 12-5 (it was after 530 at this point) and he said it would stop. But there were mornings it started around 8! Very annoying, especially when you are paying for a suite. He offered to move us but we were already settled and the last thing I wanted to do was move....especially to a lower floor. It would have been nice to have been warned upon check-in, when we could've made the decision to be lower or upgrade to the higher Executive Suites floor rooms. We were on the 22nd floor.

Breakfast was vast and very good. Expensive...but good. The wait staff was hit or miss. The host/hostesses were great but good luck getting things picked up! The first morning the staff was all over it, but the remaining days - not so much. I had to take my plates to the station. No water refills and my husband asked for a cafe mocha and it never showed up. 

They spray some sort of oils or scent in the building which can be quite overwhelming at times, but it did smell good. The music in the lobby/eating area is loud and very repetitive. Tough when you are nursing a hangover. :-)

My last complaint was the blow dryer. My hand fanning off my hair would have done a better job. Ladies, if you need to have your hair dried quickly, bring your own. 

There was good...the staff was all very friendly and super sweet. Concierge led me in the right direction, however, I wish they would have talked to me more in detail about getting to one station to the other, as it is quite overwhelming to go to Shinjuku Train Station for the first time. Once you get the hang of it - it is quite easy to get around. Overall, they were wonderful though. 

The location is good. About a 10 minute walk (if you are walking slow) to Shinkjuku Station, and there are cool places to visit around there. There's a Starbucks close - if that matters to you. If walking isn't your thing, there's a shuttle that will take you there. And the metro below will as well. 

Rooms are very clean and spacious. 

Thanks for a wonderful stay. We will be back to visit Tokyo again. Not too sure if we would consider staying here though.",3,2014/03/06

The staff at this hotel is amazing. Extremely hospitable and friendly. Very courteous and always smiling. From the moment of arrival, through registration, and concierge, I only have great things to say. The breakfast staff was also very friendly and courteous.

The room was great. Super clean and décor was very nice. 

It is connected to two subway stations via underground tunnels. They also offer a free shuttle to the Shinjuku Station, the biggest subway/bus station around the area.",5,2014/03/03
1,REDACTED,en,2246,"Stayed for three nights for the Tokyo marathon 2014

Location: as looking for somewhere by start line and this was 100% perfect for that. And close to a metro. Easy to reach from Narita airport: limo bus goes direct to door: or Narita Express to Shinjuku. There is also a shuttle to and from Shinjuku station. One comment: when we left the Hilton we took the shuttle and asked the driver which way for the Shinkansen - the way he pointed involved us dragging our bags up and down stairs - suggest asking concierge in advance which way to go at the station (or they could provide a map.....)

Rooms: as gold we were upgraded. Was a smoking room, but no smoke smell at all so perfect. Room was excellent and relatively modern: as others have noted, wifi is not free unless you are gold/platinum. We were high up (34th) and had a great view from the room

Exec lounge: a good atmosphere: quality tea/coffee/drinks, and some reasonable snacks at times. Fabulous view across the city in both directions. 

Breakfast/dining: We took dinner and breakfast at the Lobby restaurant. The breakfast buffet was best I have had across 15+hotels in Japan. Service quick and observant. Dinner well prepared. The area is internal but the lighting gave it a sophisticated atmosphere and feel

Concierge/staff: also excellent. Gave good advice on best routes by train: staff always knowledgeable and polite

Price: we booked on points and one night via tripadvisor (Japanican): the latter was a good saving and would recommend that

Overall: a really enjoyable stay. One note: had we not access to the Exec floor, I suspect my review would have been lower. That is an essential",5,2014/03/02
1,REDACTED,en,2247,"Stayed for four nights in February when we were in Tokyo for the marathon. Great location close to start of marathon and within easy walking distance of the railway and subway. Underneath the hotel is the tunnel network allowing you to walk to different stations which is very useful when it is freezing outside. 

We had an Executive room with lounge access, which was excellent value for money. Lounge offers breakfast, afternoon tea, and drinks and canapes, with access to light snacks, drinks and tea and coffee 24 hours. 

Staff were helpful in providing maps and explanations on how to get places. Lounge staff were attentive and extremely polite. Atmosphere in the lounge was relaxed and it was easy to sit in there and enjoy the view.",5,2014/03/01
1,REDACTED,en,2248,"I travelled with my husband and 2 teenage children, and reserved 2 junior suites for 7 nights. On the Hilton website these rooms seemed large and well appointed, and good value for money. However, on arrival these rooms had extremely dated bathrooms more like a 2-3* hotel, were very small and inadequate.
We also didn't like that the only free wifi was at reception, and for such a large hotel, there was only enough seating for about 8 people, unless you wanted to sit in there bar area and buy an overpriced cocktail. With plenty of business travellers, tourists and locals in the lobby many people resorted to sitting on the floor. It was more reminiscent of a hostel, especially after functions held there. My husband even had a young drunk Japanese girl pass out on him.
Service at the breakfast buffet was attentive, however not once was our order correct.
After 3 weeks in Japan staying at beautiful hotels with beyond exceptional customer service this was a very disappointing end to an incredible trip.",2,2014/03/01
1,REDACTED,en,2249,"Stayed for 7 nights on a mix of biz/tourist during February.

Well appointed lobby area, well staffed reception. The lounge area (also a la carte, and breakfast area) was comfortable and ambient, as you would expect.

Room service food was in line with similar priced hotels (though more Western focused than I was expecting).

Stayed in an Executive King City View suite - which had a good size, view and the expected trappings of a luxury hotel. Included Wi-Fi and exec lounge access and breakfast was great.

While a matter of personal taste, the bed was unusually firm.

Value for money was fair to good.",4,2014/02/28
1,REDACTED,en,2250,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Hilton in January.

The lobby area was really nice, with women playing traditional Japanese instruments for guests. The ground floor also hosted a restaurant/bar which did a really great buffet breakfast and a really nice selection of cake and coffee.

My room was really nice overall and not overly small for what i was expecting. The King size bed was obviously very large and really comfortable. The negative about the room was that the bathroom was very dated. I would struggle to give the bathroom 3*, let alone 5*. Very small, which is expected, but also very dated, which was not. The room was very clean and i didn't notice any loud noises so slept really well.

My room had good views, but that depends if you like looking at other buildings i guess.

I had room service twice. Once in the evening opting for chicken wings and a club sandwich, which were okay. Not great, but acceptable. I also had bed in breakfast which was really nice. However, i was charged for a full breakfast which i thought was harsh even though i had breakfast included, because it wasn't from the buffet. Even though i could have eaten unlimited amounts more from the buffet. Paying twice, as it's delivered to my room? I would have understood a service charge... Ah well. That may be a standard practice?

The location wasn't the best in my opinion. Whilst it has access to the underground from several locations, it's a several minute walk to the nears station.

I would definitely go back to this hotel if i was in Tokyo, However, the 4* Prince Park Tower Tokyo Hotel was better in my opinion.",5,2014/02/28
1,REDACTED,en,2251,"I love just about everything about this hotel. The ambiance, the service, the modern architecture and decor, and the food. This hotel literally screams high quality experience.

From the time you pull up to the entrance of the hotel, you are cordially greeted by doorman(women) who welcome you to the hotel with a sense of class and sophistication missing from Hilton hotels in the United States. Walking through the entrance of into the lobby provides a similar experience as the color scheme and architecture give the space a very modern feel. With their straight lines, bronze color, and hints of glass and tile, you immediately feel like you are in the lap of luxury.

Heading to the front desk is an incredibly warming experience as the front desk personnel seem eager to help you. There's nothing better than being greeted by a warm smile and sense of professionalism after a long day worth of travel or business. The people who work the front desk at the Tokyo Hilton have obviously mastered the art of customer service. And no worries about the language barrier here. Every one of the agents at the front desk and the concierge speak perfect English.

This may be a good time to mention why I said ""I love just about everything"" in my opening statement. It's the fact that everyone speaks perfect English. It might sound silly, but when I travel abroad, I like to feel that I've immersed myself in a different culture. I love the adventure of trying to understand local colloquialisms and even the nuances of the language. While at the Tokyo Hilton, you feel like you're at any luxury hotel in a major metropolitan city (like NYC). The only real difference is that a majority of the people are Japanese.

I can see that Hilton took great pains in creating an atmosphere of luxury and grandeur here, but I wish they had also added some tasteful touches from the local Japanese culture. Something to leave visitors with a feeling that they'd escaped their normal world and had entered a new, mysterious place where comfort, extravagance, and experience await. That's all.

I've stayed here twice. Once in a Junior Suite and the other in a King Executive suite. You will have NO issues with any of those room selections. Both are duly appointed with flat-screen television, incredible vistas of downtown Tokyo, and a bed that provides comfort like no other. I know that the comfort of a bed is subjective, but Hilton got it just right for me. Once I laid down, I was out.

I'm also a Gold member with HHonors, so I have access to the Executive Lounge. This is a great to grab a drink with co-workers, discuss business details with clients, and enjoy some very delectable treats from both Japanese and western cultures. Definitely worth a try if you have access. The breakfast buffet is incredible and offers a wide variety of food from both Japanese and western cultures. Be careful though...it's a bit on a pricey side.

The restaurants in the Shinjuku Hilton are also incredible. My favorite is the BRASSERIE CHECKERS which offers a buffet option of food from all over the world. If you're there when they're serving the stuffed squid or the Lobster Tails, you HAVE to try them. They're absolutely delicious.

The hotel is also conveniently located 10 minutes from the Shinjuku train station and also provides a limousine bus service to Narita airport.

All in all, I love this hotel. I try to stay here when I can while in Tokyo for business. I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area.",5,2014/02/24
1,REDACTED,en,2252,I am an experienced business traveler and consider the Tokyo Hilton my home away from home. The exec lounge staff is always very friendly and courteous and often even remembers my name. I highly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying there again as well.,5,2014/02/24
1,REDACTED,en,2253,"Great trip, met or exceeded all expectation EXCEPT in-room internet. Its supposed to support up to 3 devices, never could get it to support more than one - others in hotel had same issue. Hotel was unable to fix, referred us to their internet vendor - which was ridiculous, otherwise all good.",4,2014/02/24
1,REDACTED,en,2254,"I visit Tokyo a lot and make a point of using internet discount hotel services (you know the ones) to find 4 or 5 star hotels at bargain prices. This approach works well if one is staying put in Tokyo and does not need access to train service (if you will be using trains a lot it is better to find a hotel next to the main Tokyo train terminal). 

The Hilton Tokyo is located in the hotel district part of Shinjuku, one of Tokyo's major and certainly liveliest shopping districts. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the train station or one can take the hotel's shuttle bus which runs three times per hour for most of the day. There are also a couple of subway stations within 5 minutes walk. The west side of Shinjuku is spic and span and dominated by skyscrapers (but no restaurants, etc, close by). 

I booked a standard room as offered by the ___wire special unnamed deal for a 4.5 star hotel. Cheap by New York or DC standards but on the high side for Tokyo. 

When I arrived I found out that this price did not include breakfast which would be an additional $27 or so and not free wireless in the room. Also, standard rooms are not available for smokers if this is a priority. I was told I could access the ""executive"" rooms by paying a surcharge of about $80/night which would provide a room on a higher floor (and a better view), and access to the executive lounge on the 37th floor, where a breakfast buffet could be had, as well as unlimited snacks, coffee, and other drinks throughout the entire day, as well as free internet. 

Since I knew I would be spending a lot of time at the hotel, I took this offer. 

The room was on the 34th floor and did have a very nice view. The room wasn't spacious nor was it cramped; just enough space to walk by the bed, with a decent glass top desk that could be located in front of the window if one likes to work facing the view. The wireless internet was very fast and there was no problem using my computer, ipad and iphone simultaneously. The bathroom was adequate for a business room but cramped for a couple on a romantic outing. There was a large flatscreen with CNN, BBC and a couple FOX entertainment stations in English. 

The breakfast bar in the executive lounge was adequate, although minimalist by 4-5 star hotel standards. The bacon was razor thin and the scrambled eggs were runny but the automatic coffee machines were great.

The executive lounge was open from 6:30AM to 10PM and one could get coffee, drinks, and snacks ad libitum as part of the executive lounge package. Given the location of the hotel away from the main commercial area, this lounge area is very useful.

The service was excellent and the staff were universally competent and very helpful. 

Bottom line: The total price came to about $300+ per night for a decent but not special room with breakfast and internet included. This is OK but not a bargain given the range of alternatives in Tokyo.",5,2014/02/23
1,REDACTED,en,2255,"We stayed here tomorrow for one night during the marathon , and from the moment we checked in the service was amazing and detail, down to the smallest items.

We are Gold passport members and they couldn't upgrade us as we were on the executive floor,36 out of 38 floor!

They offer us chocolate or wine complimentary!

this is what separate this hotel from the other large chains in Tokyo that we have stay at.

1,REDACTED,en,2256,"We were so taken care of at every single point of our stay here. Remarkable!

When we checked in, I asked for a room on a higher floor and the staff member (I don't remember his name sorry) let me know that we've actually been upgraded from a standard room to a junior suite for FREE! We also had a late flight the next day and he also extended our check out til 2pm the next day - that is unheard of! And we didn't even asked. He used his common sense and organised it all for us. Absolutely brilliant! 

The suite was amazing - I can't say enough to do it justice. I will be using the bathroom and bedroom as inspiration when we build our house, thats for sure. 

I will definitely be returning. Thank you for an amazing stay!",5,2014/02/22

1,REDACTED,en,2260,"Coming in tired after a long day of traveling we were exhausted. Narita is a 80 minutes train ride to Shinjuku station and then a 15 minute walk to the hotel. We are diamond members and love Hilton properties. This was our first time here. We found out later Hilton Honor members can check in at the exec floor lounge on the 37th floor. I wish we would have known that earlier or it would have been good to have a sign in the lobby saying this. We got our first room and it was very small. The fan in the room/air conditioning did not work. The room cooled, but there was no air circulation. After calling the front desk, they sent a repairman, but still did not work. We then asked if we could change rooms and they accommodated by giving us a bigger room on the 11th floor. The room was very nice and clean, but unfortunately not much of a view. I asked on my reservation for highest floor possible and really wanted that. Not sure why they did not do that, perhaps they were full. Also not sure why they did not upgrade us to the bigger room when we first checked in as they usually do for diamond members. All of this occurred though when were very tired and probably cranky from traveling all day.

After that the stay was nothing short of fantastic. Japan is such a great and friendly country and this hotel does not disappoint. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. The room was very clean, although bathroom was a little small and odd in that if you turn on the light in the bathroom, people in the rest of the room can the bright light which will wake you up at night - it is hard to explain, but there is a window from the main room into the shower!

Wifi worked great, the executive floor lounge was the best we have ever experienced - strict dress code applies - no shorts, flip flops, hats, tattoos - and they mean it which is fantastic! The manager had to talk to some people who were dressed inappropriately. Views were amazing with Mt. Fuji clearly seen.

The location is also perfect - we learned after exploring a day that the hotel is on top of a subway station for 2 lines and is super convenient - just one stop to Shinjuku, but there is a bus service as well for free. The walk is only 15 minutes as well to that station and 5 minutes to the heart of Shinjuku. Fantastic location!!! Don't be afraid of the subway - it looks harder than it is - easier than Europe or the USA, just follow the maps or ask for help if you need it.

We will definitely stay here on our next trip and I am sure we will give it 5 stars next time.",4,2014/02/18
1,REDACTED,en,2261,"This hotel is fabulous. The rooms are luxurious. The fitness center has everything you need to stay healthy while indulging in the restaurants various menu items. And the view from our window was spectacular, even as a blizzard of snow blew below. Be prepared however as the menus will cost you and if you want internet in your room you will have to pay unless you are an elite Hilton Honors member (gold or above). There is also a free shuttle that will take you to the mall and an area that is fun to explore and look for a deal on ramen or tempura dishes.",5,2014/02/17
1,REDACTED,en,2262,Good hotel with typical Hilton experience. Walking distance to Shinjuku station but a free shuttle bus every 20 minutes was very useful in bad weather. Executive lounge had good canapés and the service was exceptional. Hotel restaurants were pricey but with almost 5000 restaurants in Shinjuku there is no excuse not to go out!,4,2014/02/15
1,REDACTED,en,2263,"We arrived after flying in from Osaka where we stayed at a fairly grim hotel, I wasn't too sure what to expect, the majority of Hilton's in the UK are pretty tired and dated - a total contradiction of this hotel.. 

We had 7 rooms for 5 nights. Everything was fresh, the staff are all really helpful and the services they offer here are all pretty perfect. 

Checking in was incredibly easy, everything was prepared for us to head to our rooms pretty much immediately, which was hugely appreciated.. 

My room on the 22nd floor was great, spacious, clean and fresh - the bed was totally amazing and so was the view. 

The only slight issue was how dated the bathroom was, although it still had everything you need including a bath big enough to consider drowning in (and I'm 6ft1"") 

The vegetarian room service was fantastic, really reasonably priced - although I missed it the first night as it's actually at the back of the menu, behind the deserts and drinks menu.. 

Breakfast is amazing, and once again really reasonable considering the feast which is on offer, carefully adaptable to European, American and Eastern diets. 

While exploring Tokyo, I actually felt guilty about not spending as much time in the hotel as I should, and I felt pretty depressed when I eventually had to check out!

For the brave there's direct access to the underground metro. For the weak, there's a taxi rank right outside the hotel entrance, so getting around is really easy. 

The gym and swimming pool were really great - limited, but one of the best I've experienced in a hotel. 

I used the laundry service twice, once using the economy service, which I still received back about 3 hours later, then used the express service (50% more) the following day where housekeeping admittedly screwed up, I was thrilled however when at around midnight they accepted they were wrong and would deliver it back to me at 11am the next morning, only charging me for the economy service, which was a fight I was preparing to have to deal with. 

This hotel understands the confused, anxious minds of the jet-lagged, but more importantly they understand the power of great customer service. 

I can't wait to one day return to this hotel.",5,2014/02/11
1,REDACTED,en,2264,"A junior suite with panoramic city views at the Hilton Tokyo is easily surpassed ... by the superior service of every staff member as the most memorable part of any stay.

From check-in, when I was asked my depature flight details and proactively offered an extension of check-out to the latest feasible time, the service was seamless. The suite was spotless and spacious. While busy in the evening there was no shortage of seating in the executive lounge and table service was offered. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was extensive with Japanese, Western and Chinese options and the same level of impeccable service.

Ideal location for a hotel in Tokyo will depend on your plans, though ready access to the metro via the hotel basement and a frequent shuttle bus to Shinjuku station mean that just about anywhere should be readily accessible. A direct limousine bus to Narita Airport is also available for around USD$35.",4,2014/02/11

1,REDACTED,en,2267,"We stayed at the Hilton Tokyo end of december and had a generally pleasant stay. The airport shuttle bus dropped us off directly in front of the hotel, which was very convenient. Unfortunately the second room was not ready although checking in after 3pm so we had to wait in the other room for approximately half an hour. As a very nice gesture, we received a bottle of wine, a cocktail glas full of strawberries and chocolate. Overall the staff at the hotel was very friendly. The highlight of our stay was definitely the breakfast, although during the peak time the breakfast area was to crowded and some of the food and drinks were not available due to the overconsumption by to many guests. For all those who don't have wifi included in the room rate/due to status, one can easily access the free wifi at the lobby area which also has some nice seating options on the second floor.
Overall the hotel provides very good value for money, although the price differences among the travel agencies were tremendous. We used a special travel club which offered rooms including breakfast for 125€/night whereas the official hilton.com website demanded rates of more than 300€/night even without breakfast. Ridiculous! Be careful and book wisely!",5,2014/02/08

1,REDACTED,en,2269,"The Tokyo Hilton is a wonderful locale for both business and pleasure. (I've stayed for both.) From a business perspective, the Hilton has all the infrastructure and convenience needed by a business traveler. Tourists will enjoy the hotel as well. The concierge was wonderful and helpful. As expected in Japan, the hotel runs efficiently while being infused with graciousness and civility. (I'm a big Japan fan. I think both have to do with the national character as much as the particular hotel.) One issues to be aware of.... The Hilton is not close to any specific tourist spots. It's not a problem for me as I'm a veteran of the Tokyo Metro system. Frankly, the major sites are somewhat spreadout in Tokyo. Consequently, no hotel is ideal from a tourists perspective. If you aren't comfortable with subways, Tokyo will be a challenge for you. Just be aware. Finally, from a value standpoint, I think the Hilton is superlative. I work for a very large/recognizable corporation. We have phenomenal rates around the world. The rate I paid is astounding for a hotel in central Tokyo. I'm not sure what the ""rack rate"" is so I can't make an objective comment about value.",5,2014/02/06
1,REDACTED,en,2270,"The location was very good, closed to the station. (around 10 minutes walk). I booked a junior suite. The room size is fantastic and it's clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. But the bathroom was comparatively small. I had a very bad experience in paying the bill. I booked this hotel at promotion rate via booking.com. However, Hilton charged me the full rate. Therefore, I had to call IDD and check what's going wrong, but it's so difficult to communicate with them. The lady who received my call did not speak English very well. I spent over 20 minutes on the phone but I had to give up. I communicated with them by email afterwards. Finally they refunded the difference to my credit card. As they charged/refunded me in Japanese Yen but I paid/received in HKD, I still had to pay the exchange difference charged by the credit card. I arrived around 6:30 and checked in, they gave me a twin bed room but I booked a king size bed. The receptionist said no king size bed was available at that moment. I told them that I got the confirmation from Hiliton and I insisted to have a king size bed. I wasted half an hour at the counter becuase of their mistake.",4,2014/02/05

1,REDACTED,en,2272,"After being at the snow, a lavish night was needed. As with all Hiltons it was a very polished experience that made me wish i had some better form of clothing than snow slum wear.
Fantastic beds and a nice view of Tokyo from the 24th floor. 
The one con I believe was the lack of a bar of soap. Strange really that there was no means to wash your hands. It may have been a command on the toilet. I'd mention the $7Aud can of cola, but it is a Hilton after all. 
We booked and rode from outside the foyer on the Airport Limousine to Narita which was an excellent service, enough to make me do that again over the NEX Train next trip.
Location is OK, but nowhere in that part of Tokyo is really a long walk. Its proximity to the Govt Buildings next door and the free Observation Deck was excellent. Sunset and Mt Fuji all in one, very nice.
We would stay again, and bring our own soap.",3,2014/02/02

1,REDACTED,en,2274,"Upside:
1) Room and Amenities - excellent. Though we didn't get to make it out because we were always gallivanting.
2) Food - Room service meals were OK, nothing to rave about. 
3) Free Shuttle Service every 30 minutes
4) (Non-Hilton) Coffee shop and ATM Machines at the basement. Staff there are very friendly / helpful; Starbucks around the corner. 
5) Location is good. But need to take the shuttle if you want to visit shopping places.

Downside:
1) Shuttle Drivers - not helpful with traveler- passengers even when they see that they have huge suitcases to bring inside the bus and are already within age range of 50 & up. We ended up helping them while the driver just watched

2) Lobby - too busy; nobody there to assist guest that have arrived & ready to check in. No Greet & meet.

3) Concierge Staff - Always confined inside their counter. All of 4 them! Does not make guests feel special / not friendly / not warm.

4) Smoking Floor Common Area - Clean & tidy, but could use frequent spritz of air freshener",3,2014/01/29
1,REDACTED,en,2275,"This is a fine hotel in the Hilton tradition of quality, service, and location. The location – within walking distance of Shinjuku station – provides easy access to all the great places to visit in Tokyo as well as the many establishments in and around the station. The executive lounge at the hotel is on the 37th floor with fantastic views, including a beauty of Mount Fuji if weather and pollution factors permit. And of course, you get all the professionalism and outward courtesy that is present everywhere in Japan.

So why is Shah not more generous with his stars? Well, what is also expected, especially in Japan, is loyalty to those who give you a great deal of business. Such is the case for those who are Diamond members, and therefore do have an expectation of something a bit more than the ordinary, such as an upgraded room. Every Hilton does this so it was more than surprising that the Hilton Tokyo failed in this regard (for two rooms that Shah had booked with them). It is also disappointing when the front desk clerks claim that executive rooms are not available. Do they not realize that this lie can be caught with just one look at their reservations page on the Internet?

As fans of Shah know, he is so perceptive as to see through people rather easily; his canine instincts are still very sharp indeed. It is very unfortunate but true that many Japanese still treat foreigners as second-class citizens. And until they realize that all the outward smiles and endless bowing simply can't mask their inward feelings, this situation will unfortunately continue.

Shah Rukh says: If you are a loyal Hilton patron, then do demand (politely) that they treat you with the respect and courtesy that many other Hilton properties automatically do. Smiles and bows are fine, but a room on the 35th floor with a Mount Fuji view is even better, and expected if you are Diamond.

Shah Rukh's tip: Take the ""Friendly Limousine bus"" from Narita or Haneda airport directly to the hotel for $30 and $12, respectively. This is really convenient, though do expect it to take 90 mins or more if c",3,2014/01/29

The breakfast is absolutely amazing, and the staff can't do enough. The pool is great for kids to let off some steam! And it's in a good spot in Shinjuku",5,2014/01/27
1,REDACTED,en,2279,"We spent two weeks in this hotel during October/November 2013 with my girlfriend and our friend. This was my first visit to a hotel of this standard and I have to admit that I wasn't disappointed.

We stayed in the King Executive room (with my girlfriend) for most of our stay, but the last 3 nights we upgraded to the Junior Executive Suite. Both of the rooms were very comfy and modern with their decoration. It was noticeable that the rooms had just been renovated because everything was in top shape.

We are very strict about the cleanliness of the hotelrooms we stay at and I can say that these rooms were the cleanest we have ever seen. I can't say anything bad about the housekeeping. One time we made our bed and left a book on top of it before we left the room. When we came back, the bed had been made by their standards and the book was on the same exact spot we left it. I mean EXACTLY. They had put it a little ""crooked"" like we had. That is attention to detail.

I really liked the bathroom. The shower was one of the best I have used in hotels and it was nice that it was separate from the tub.

The bed.... don't even get me started. My neck starts to ache even when sleeping in my own bed and I never feel that hotel beds are perfect, but this time it was! I always woke up refreshed without any aching. The bed is firm, but still soft enough to make it comfortable. The pillows are huge and weigh a lot, but they were really good. For the whole 2 weeks, I slept better than I have in a long time.

Executive-level rooms have complimentary wifi (which worked well) and the customers have access to the Executive Lounge on the 37th floor. I recommend eating your breakfast here because it is so much relaxing and the view is spectacular. The customer service here is fantastic.

It's hard to say if you should take the Junior Suite or not, because in a way the Lounge gives you a big livingroom eitherway. Both are very good and the Junior Suite was amazing. It just depends on your budget really. Junior Suite isn't necessary, but I have to admit that it is still better ;).

Special thanks goes to Mr. Goto who is the Executive Lounge Manager. He really made us feel welcome and he was a great guy. The service in this hotel is the best I have ever experienced.

I know that these kinds of reviews never feel honest, but I can't help but compliment the hotel, because I can't wait to get back there.

The only ""cons"" are as follows:

- Sometimes we could hear sounds from the next room. It might have been because there was a connecting door from the King Executive room to the next one. This wasn't a problem because normally the soundproofing was good.
- I informed the hotel a couple of times that I have a birthday on the day we were travelling and I would be celebrating on this trip. In a hotel like this, I should have gotten some recognition of that. Even a card or something, but nobody mentioned my birthday. This might sound like a small thing, but it is a pretty big deal when paying this much on a hotel.
- I had agreed to pay extra for a room upgrade from eStandby (Hilton Honors exclusive), but for some reason they didn't accept the confirmation I had on this even though they had available rooms.

All in all I really recommend using this hotel on a trip to Tokyo, because everything is within reach and the transportation options are the best in the city. Shinjuku itself is a very good choice for a hotel. We used the Limousine Bus from the airport to get to the hotel and back to the airport and it worked very well.",5,2014/01/26

The executive lounge was available almost all day and the food and beverages offered were amazing and served with the usual Japanese service (i.e.. excellent). The breakfast buffet was the best I have had thus far (I have also stayed at J.W Marriot, Crowne Plaza,Sheraton and The W chains) with a variety surpassing expectation.

The best thing about this hotel was the location with free shuttles to shinjuku station and several restaurants and izakaya's near the station. It's also a short train journey to shibuya which has amazing themed restaurants.

1,REDACTED,en,2291,"This Hilton has an executive lounge, but unless you book a room in the lounge floor, even with your Gold/Diamond status, you would not be able to access the lounge. We only found out during check-in and at that time, there wasn't any room available, even if we were to pay for the upgrade. It is a disappointment for us as that is one of the main reasons I pick the Hilton brand hotel. 

It also looks like the hotel is in the middle of renovating its bathrooms, as we were given one that was quite dated, while I see much updated ones in TripAdvisor. 

The hotel is relatively convenient...it has a walkway to Nishi-Shinjuku station from lobby but if you want stops and restaurants, most of them are near the Shinjuku JR station which is about 10-15 min walk away. There is a hotel shuttle to the Shinjuku station every half an hour or so that is quite convenient.

However, this was sorted with emails.",5,2014/01/13
1,REDACTED,en,2293,"This is our fourth visit to Tokyo. We stayed at two other five star hotels in Shinjuku in the past. Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku is the most outstanding and memorable one. 

We stayed for six nights in last December. We booked two Executive rooms (1 King and 1 twin plus extra bed) through CX holidays. As there wasn't much information given on the travel agent's website, we expected to receive standard service with a high price tag. Fantastically, this stay has exceeded much of our expectation.

Before our departure from Australia, I had to ensure that there would be three beds for my teenage children in their room as this was not clearly confirmed by the agent. So, I had to contact the hotel reservation department myself and we had a number of exchanges of email because they couldn't find our reservation due to some systematic issues with the travel agent. I was so impressed by the efficiency of the reservation staff in locating our record and answering my enquiries. A job well done.

We received a warm welcome by the Reception staff and the check-in was smooth. We were given rooms on the 38th floor. The rooms were spacious, modern and clean (I think they have undergone some refurbishment a couple of years ago). How nice to be in a hotel bedroom as comfortable as the one in your own house! Perhaps, it is the executive floor, it is pleasantly quiet on this level. The view from our room was impressive. I personally appreciate the sliding paper and wooden screens at the windows which add a fine Japanese touch to the room. 

We made enquiries about a tour to Mt. Fuji/Hakone. The Concierge staff was so efficient and helpful in assisting us to book a tour on our arrival as well as the airport shuttle bus to Haneda Airport. We would like to thank all the staff (Ms. Nakamura and others) in recommending us some nice restaurants and making the bookings for us accordingly. It was often very busy at this desk but they were always patiently rendered their assistance.

Staying on the Executive floor, we could freely use the Executive lounge at its opening hours. We enjoyed the exclusive use of it. Especially after a long day out, it was nice to have a relaxing place, not confining in one's own room, for a drink before heading out again. The staff was friendly and happy to have a chat with the patrons. Our special thanks to Sho Goto-san, Emi Suzuki-san and all the staff who work on this floor for their exemplary services. You have made our stay very memorable.

The buffet breakfast and pre-dinner canape were very nicely prepared. There is not a wide variety of food as in some other Asian countries which can be overwhelming and excessive but enough. We do enjoy the simple elements and concepts of Japanese food.

The location of the hotel is not that close to the Shinjuku train station; but, there is a shuttle bus service running back and forth between the hotel and the station at a 20 minute interval. There is a also a subway connecting the hotel and the Marunouchi line. One won't get wet in the rain (we had three days of rain during our stay) to catch a train and it is very safe to walk at night time. The i-land building next door has a few eateries and a building nearby has a few fine dining restaurants. 

If we visit Tokyo again, we will certainly consider to stay at Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku again.",5,2014/01/12

The room was what I would expect from a Hilton seeing how it was clean and arranged quite well so that any guest would feel comfortable. Though my view from the 37th floor was a nice added bonus. The executive lounge was a nice place to grab a tasty snack and drink in the morning and the evening. They really take good care of Hilton Honors gold members. Although the hotel wasn't a close walk to Shinjuku Station, the complimentary shuttle service accounted for that fact. If you don't want to wait for the shuttle there are also two subway lines within walking distance below the hotel which was also quite convenient.

1,REDACTED,en,2297,"Used Hilton Honors Points for 2 rooms so can’t really complain. Staff were courteous and helpful. Our rooms were not particularly luxurious but fine. I wondered whether you get nicer rooms if you are not using Loyalty Points.

Breakfast buffet was very nice but needs a little reorganising. There were huge queues. Residents should be encouraged to go to different stations and there would be more numerous but shorter queues. What was happening was that the polite residents were joining a ONE LONG queue of people many of whom just wanted, say, the Japanese breakfast but not the Western one. So all the residents who wanted the western food would wait behind the clients selecting their miso soup and grilled fish. A bit barmy really and easily solved by delineating the cuisines somehow. It got to the stage where we would just cut right in for our sausages and scrambled egg. It looked really rude but life is too short to wait in a line behind 20 people, many of whom don’t even want what you want – it’s just that what they want comes first! 

This is not a hugely picturesque area (finding the hotel by following signs for Metropolitan Govt Offices gives you a clue!) Lots of good eateries close by (including the underground passes) if you know to look. Our first stop was the nearby Spaghetti Goemon – I love pasta done Japanese style! There are several different conbinis (convenience stores) nearby and they sell different brands of beer so if you have a favourite tipple have a quick look. My husband found a favourite black beer in a conbini which was pretty useless for everything else!

One travel tip – if you are arriving at Narita Airport on a Friday or Saturday evening and do not have much luggage consider taking the Narita Express to Shinjuku. Our ride in on the “Friendly Airport Limousine Bus” took over 2 hours because of the weekend traffic. On the way out however, we left at 7am and the ride was fine. And of course the bus is much handier if you have more luggage as it is door to door. Japanese people travel very light as they often use a courier service (eg Takkubin).",4,2014/01/10
1,REDACTED,en,2298,My husband and 4 friends stayed 5 nights at Tokyo Hilton. This was our second trip to Tokyo and I have to say that Tokyo Hilton just made it perfect! The rooms are huge - they are exactly what we would expect in Sydney. Last time we stayed in a wardrobe pretty much. and this was HEAVEN! The buffet breakfast was amazing. It is probably only second to Glass buffet breakfast. There was a wonderful manager there by the name of Leon who honestly made the trip even more special! He gave us so many tips and didnt mind that I ordered 3 double espresso's every morning as the coffee was so good! The gym there is AMAZING. and there is a sauna and swimming pool. The hotel itself is about a 10minute walk to Shinjuku station but honestly its worth it. On our nights out we would catch a cab home which was only about 700 YEN. Cannot recommend it enough...its true hilton luxury.,5,2014/01/10
1,REDACTED,en,2299,"Before my trip to Tokyo, I researched the best location to spend four day exploring this mega city and I settled for this Hilton close to the Shinjuku station. Well, after I arrived I realized that for a first time tourist in the city, the best place to stay in Tokyo is somewhere close to the Tokyo station, 20 minutes by subway from the Hilton. It will save you hours of commute to the best attractions in this wonderful city.

Other than the location, this Hilton is a great hotel, with outstanding service (kind of the norm in Japan) but dated rooms with tiny bathrooms. The breakfast is amazing so try to get it included in your rate.",4,2014/01/10
1,REDACTED,en,2300,"We loved this hotel. As a family of four with two young boys, we booked a suite to accommodate two extra roller-a-way beds. This was cheaper than booking two rooms, which we had to do at most other Japanese hotels and a great option to really spread out and feel relaxed. The suite was very large, with a great view over Shinjuku office buildings. Our king size bed was so comfortable, it was just so good, I keep wanting to be back in it! The large room with great beds was a wonderful way to rest after all our shopping. The breakfast was fantastic with Western and Japanese options. The kids loved the pancakes & donuts and my husband loved the omelette station. Breakfast was included in the advance payment web option, so great value. The bathroom could have been a little more modern, but we were happy with it. The free shuttle bus to & from the train station was great for getting to the shopping district. We loved this hotel & would stay again.
",4,2014/01/10
1,REDACTED,en,2301,"Our stay in this hotel was nothing short of fantastic. The hotel is very clean, the beds are comfortable, and the room we stayed in had an updated bathroom.The hotel is also situated in a very convenient area. It is close to a number of eating places and within walking distance to Family Mart and Starbucks. Transportation is not a problem as well since the hotel has a link underground to the Marunouchi Line. The complimentary shuttle service to Shinjuku Station was also frequent and convenient during our stay.

Our experience with Hilton Tokyo was almost perfect in every way except that, when we checked in, it took a while before we were able to get a room. This was, however, not so much of an issue as we stayed in the lobby while waiting, and the entire place smelled terrific (some sort of green tea fragrance). Their staff was also very helpful. My brother bought plenty of stuff from Amazon, and we were always notified by phone to pick them up just when we get back to our room. 

We stayed in the upper floors and the city view outside was also nice. I would recommend this hotel to anyone though their rates may be a bit steep for budget travelers.",5,2014/01/09
1,REDACTED,en,2302,"Let's begin by saying we have very high expectation of hotels and have stayed in many across the Hilton Group of hotels, unfortunately our experience at the Hilton Tokyo was not one that we enjoyed. 

Yes staff were courteous and helpful but that's the minimum requirement for a 4-5 star hotel. The room we stayed in has obviously not been renovated. The wall paper on the ceiling was peeling left right and centre and the bathroom clearly demonstrated it was desperately in need for a massive update (I assume this is happening already as mentioned in other reviews but unfortunately we got stuck with an old one). 

The room was extremely underwhelming and we were glad we only stayed for two nights. Apart from the lobby, I'm not sure if anything else has been renovated recently, the sauna/spa area was basic and the executive lounge tired. The offering at the lounge was also far inferior to other Hilton properties.

Breakfast was crowded but at least the variety was decent. In terms of location, it's not inconvenient but certainly not very convenient either. The hotel is connected by underground walkways to Nishi-Shinjuku station, approx. 5 mins walk or there's a free hotel shuttle that takes you to Shinjuku Station, outside Odakyu Department store.

Overall, the service (software) is 5 star quality but the dated hardware (room/facilities) made it really difficult to enjoy. For the price it charges, there are more modern alternatives and for us personally, the chances of returning is slim and recommendation to friends/family is unlikely.",2,2014/01/09
1,REDACTED,en,2303,"The location is great in the center of the city next to a train station, and believe me I used taxis in tokyo as they are more confit able than a public train but the traffic is horrible so location is quite important",4,2014/01/09
1,REDACTED,en,2304,"My travel agent recommended this hotel and it was a good stay. However, my expectations were different - being a frequent international American traveler - and this was my first overnight trip to Asia.

I got to the hotel fairly late -past midnight as my flight landed late and had to fork out $120USD for a cab (no trains running that late). When I checked in, I was a bit disappointed to find out I'd be in a room with 2 twin beds - they didn't have anything else. This kinda blew my tone for the rest of the trip as I have never stayed in a hotel room with a double bed or smaller. Call me spoiled. And the fact we were spending over $350 USD a night I was just expecting a bigger bed.

The lobby area was nicely decorated and surprisingly busy for being 1 am. A quick elevator ride and short walk to my room made me realize I'm in a cruise-ship style room. It was definitely smaller than I'm used to at Hilton properties. Then again, this IS Japan. It was nicely decorated and the sliders blocking the windows/light did their job quite well. Fortunately the hotel had a few US channels and some with english subtitles. I had to spend a few bucks to login to the internet as the city-wide WIFI through the cell providers have instructions ONLY in Japanese & Google was not translating it very well :)

The bathroom was alright, but the toilet controls were definitely neat. I've never sat on a toilet seat that can play music, warm itself up, and also spray your butt. I've always had a separate bidet, so kudos to the Japanese for making it all one toilet.

Shower took a bit to get warm, but it was sufficient and nice.

The twin bed though bugged me. I was hoping the rooms were like cruise-ship rooms where you could push the beds together -- but no go. I ended up using all the pillows in the room and at least got a decent sleep in... just missed being able to sprawl out on a queen/king bed.

Hotel staff during my stay were good. I was happy that the concierge desk sells the visitors pass for the train - $5 USD/day and the stations are very close to the hotel. The Denny's nearby is NOT your traditional Denny's -- there is a McDonalds around the corner of the hotel that has a fairly ""Americanized"" menu, and I believe a 7-11'esque type store also sold comfort foods to satisfy any culture.

The hotel is in the Shinjuku area of Tokyo - which is great if you are doing business here as this is where most companies have offices, but if you are playing a tourist like me, its WWWAAAYYY out of the way. I had to take a 20 minute subway ride to Tokyo Station just to get anywhere. I also took a tour from HATO Tours and they did a great job with their American speaker. These tours typically will leave Tokyo Station and I'd recommend the Tokyo Skytree & Asukusa Tour (about $65 USD) and also make it to the Ueno Park Zoo. I also found the city to be VERY tourist friendly - maps everywhere, and also in English. And if you don't know the language -- most restaurants have picture guides of their menus.

Now, I may backtrack a bit - if you are flying in and out of Narita, the NEX departs from just a few blocks away... so its not totally out of the way.

Stay was overall pleasant. I was just expecting something different because of the high price paid for the room. I also appreciate being able to use the health club well after checkout to shower and rest up before my 930PM flight out (although i have NEVER showered sitting down... it was an experience!). Everyone was very accommodating and their english was very good.",3,2014/01/09
1,REDACTED,en,2305,"I stayed at the Hilton Shinjuku while on a business trip and have to say I was very happy with the over all experience.
The location is great but even better is that the hotel run a complimentary shuttle bus service to the main Shinjuku underground station which gives to great access to the rest of Tokyo. Access to this hotel from the airport is also extremely easy with a reasonably priced shuttle bus service running regularly. 
The hotel its self was great and the room very lovely with everything you would expect from a Hilton hotel. I had a great view of the Shinjuku sky line from my room which had a huge windows, the room also had a great TV and Dvd player. Personally I loved the little touch of a complimentary QG and Vogue magazine in the desk of the room. 

When visiting Tokyo again I would definitely stay at this Hotel mainly for the great location and also the access it gave to the transport network.",4,2014/01/05

This is an issue ESP for business travelers who are spending upwards of four months at this hotel. 

The gym is fine, there is a lap pool as well. Executive lounge is nice for breakfast and a drink in the evening.",3,2014/01/04
1,REDACTED,en,2309,"this is a really good hotel...for many reasons...we stayed here for 7 nights on holiday and it was a great experience....

1. great location...sits above the train system where you can easily walk to the Marunouchi Line as well as the Oedo Line....both of those lines can easily get you to many places or easy transfers to other main lines such as Ginza Line....so as far as convenience very very good....but just keep in mind you do have a walk...

2. The rooms are big, clean and comfortable...the only minor issue was the bathrooms was a little small...but at least very clean and had all the amenities

3. i am very sensitive to noise.....and i have to say the room was also very quite...no outside noise and very little to any noise from the hallways....

4. the staff was extremely friendly and willing/able to help with all of our needs....always with smile and energy

5. if you are diamond adn have access to the lounge...then even better....i have been to many hotel lounges (new york, san fran, paris, london, even conrad tokyo...etc etc) and i have to say this is definitely one of the best of them all....in terms of the food and drink selection and quality...and again the service team at the lounge...really really impressive...friendly helpful good attitude....great experience

6. the hotel was also relatively easy to get to from Narita airport....we took the bus to and from the airport...only two stops along the way.....the whole journey once on the bus is about 90-110 minutes depending on traffic.....but its convenient if you have alot of luggage....if you dont have lot of luggage....you can take the Narita express to Shinjuku station...then do quick one stop trip on subway to nishi-shinjuku station which is almost under the hotel....about 250 meter walk....

7. the hotel is not too far of a walk from shinjuku area....if it were not for the cold weather it woudl actaully be a nice walk....as its very clean and pleasant area.....

8. outside the hotel to the right about 300 meters is a really nice supermarket...so if you need anything or want some fruit or drinks for the room its really easy to go out and pick up some things....

the only things to be prepared for about the hotel are the following:

1. the plugs in the room are NOT international so you will need to bring at least one adapter...if you are there on business...then you might need TWO adapters...one for your computer and one for phone.....

2. the lighting at the desk was not sufficient....

3. there is no plug near the bedside...so little difficult to charge the phone and use it as alarm...

4. if you are trying to get into TOP tier restaurants the hotel concierge does not seem to have the power to get seats.....i gave them a list of about 15 top rated restaurants and could not get me into any....so i had my local friend call and he was able to get me into 4 of them...i do want to clarify....the concierge team is amazing....they are very hard working....friendly...knowledgeable and helpful....i just think for some reason they dont have the pull at those great food places....just a heads up....so if you are looking to get in try to use just local person to call and reserve for you...if possible....

i would definitely stay here again....either business or holiday.....",5,2014/01/04

1,REDACTED,en,2313,"I stayed on the Hilton Tokyo for over 100 nights (prior to moving my family to Japan full time). 

The location is on the west side of the city, so a bit of a longer ride to/from Narita, and away from Roppongi, Ginza, and Shibuya, but very close to Shinjuku. Two subway lines are accessible without having to go outside (although a bit of walk, even though underground). There is also a shuttle to/from Shinjuku station. If you are Hilton Honors member, I found it to be worth the extra commute to stay here for extended visits--- and btw, get to know the Subway system -- a cab ride to Roppongi will cost $50+, or ~$3 by subway, and take about the same amount of time.

The exec floor rooms are very nice and large by Japan standards. The exec lounge is outstanding both for breakfast and evening drinks/snacks. Great selection, good service, and good views on clear days. It can be busy, so get there earlier for breakfast. Agree with others that it can get full in the evenings, but that is mostly because groups of people have decided to park there for the evening (it's not for dinner folks...). Nice selection of drinks throughout the day are available.

The Internet connection is acceptable, but not great if you are trying to stream.

There is a convenient store in the walkway/tunnel underneath the hotel and a few restaurants, but for the more interesting places to eat outside of the hotel, you will have to walk 10-15 minutes to the Shinjuku area. 

The staff was very accommodating when my family came out (before our apt was available) and did their best to make us feel at home (presents for the kids, etc...).",5,2014/01/02

Rooms are spacious and very comfortable.

My only issue is price. If not booked far enough in advance, the rates are outrageous. It can be up to 600 per night.

This place should not exceed about 275 USD per night at any time.

When the price is too high, I am forced to stay across the street at the Keio Plaza. Although I prefer the Hilton, the Keio is also nice and its price is always reasonable.",5,2014/01/02

I was surprised at the fluent English they spoke. It was very nice. The rooms were very trendy and I really liked the theme they used.

The food in the executive lounge was also very cool and had cool Japanese styled foods. The staff were very friendly all over the hotel. I really couldn't believe how nice they were. The location is also fairly decent. The walk to the JR Station is not bad and there is a bus to go there anyway. There is also a subway that is right below the hotel. The i-Land is right below as well and has many very good restaurants. Hiltopia below the hotel is also a very interesting place to walk around. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay here.

1,REDACTED,en,2318,"Overall we thought the hotel was nice although we were little bit underwhelmed as we had expected better service. If you are looking for a hotel with view of mount Fuji then I would recommend this hotel. We had King Tower Suite with magnificent views of Fujisan.

Location
We found the hotel bit off from the main tourist track. However its only about 10-15min walk to Shinjuku station (there is also a free minibus) so when you want to be in the tourist track it wont be long.

Rooms
Apart from the view we found the rooms bit weak. Decor was old and minimalistic and it did not feel like a warm place. Even the suite was so old. The bathroom definetely did not live up to the standard of a suite in our view. The room in was spacious however with plenty of space to entertain friends and for the kids to play. Standard room also seemd pretty spacious.

The View

Great views of mount Fuji. Its winter season with clear weather and we definetely enjoyed the views. Sun setting on Fuji is great.

Service
Similarly to other people writing here we did not feel the warm service we had anticipated in Japan and experienced in most other places we have visited. The service was very robotic and cold. When we called the reception to arrange extra beds as we had requested at time of booking we were told that there would be extra charge. After going to reception it was cleared but this should not happen for top class hotel. I do not want to be forced to go down to get what I had paid for.

Restaurants
We only tried the breakfast, which was one of the best I have had in a hotel before. Fantastic but very expensive if you do not have inclusive package.

Spa
There is a oldish swimming pool, which has got dedicated space for kids. Free bathrobes are provided. As its old fashioned Japanese place you need to bring your swimming hat or they will give you one. The hotel also includes a Japanese bath area,which whilst not special is very typical and you can truly relax after a busy day of sightseeing. Nice area to cool off.",3,2013/12/30

1,REDACTED,en,2320,"We stayed at this hotel a week before Christmas.The hotel is modern, clean and the service is beyond what i would ever expect at any hotel. The staff would bend over backwards for their guests. I requested a Mt. Fuji view and probably got the best view we could get. They also let us check in early, ~11am. We showed up a bit earlier than expected and they accommodated us in any way we wanted. 

The rooms are normal sized rooms for a Hilton. We did not stay on an executive floor however the room looked exactly like an executive style room at some other Hiltons we stayed at. The bed was comfortable, soft (not like the typical hard Japanese style) and 4 huge pillows. The room was spotless and bathroom clean. The TV had some English channels along with some entertaining local Japanese channels.

We had access to the executive floor lounge which was top notch. Excellent food and alcohol choices. The service was great. The breakfast buffet was the best one i have seen in a long time. The selection was both Japanese and Western style. You will not leave hungry.

The hotel is exactly 15 minutes walk from JR Shinjuku Southern Terrace Entrance. We timed it. If you are arriving at that station and plan on walking i would recommend printing a map for reference. We used Google maps on our phone and it made it easier. There is a shuttle that will pick you up at the station but it might be hard to find it first time. We only took the shuttle once as it was easier to walk; it allowed us to shop and eat snacks along the way.

Hotel provide free shuttle bus service to Shinjuku Station every 20min interval. Hotel is within walking distance, around 20 min. We have used the shuttle service due to cold weather.

Due to language barrier, emailed hotel to help making restaurant reservation, received reply from their concierge almost immediately. Special commendation to Ms Nakamura from Concierge whose calm composure and experience has managed to convince a restaurant to accept us even restaurant has some concern in accepting us due to language barrier.",4,2013/12/24
1,REDACTED,en,2330,"Arrived almost midnight and 1st time staying at Hilton Shinjuku. Reception staff was polite but took a while to sort the rooms. When finally done, I went to a room which was occupied and it was an embarassing moment as the guest was half dressed. Had to go downstairs with my luggages and left sitting at reception for a few minutes before getting the rooms few floors down. I guess the way the hotel apologize for that mistake was sending a small tray of fruits without a note.
Executive lounge was mediocre. Told the staff that the coffee machine is out of milk as the caffe macchiato is just a shot of expresso. She just pointed to me that there is milk in the fridge. Then they hurried to inform all the guests that the lounge is closing at 10pm.
On the last day, at checkout, I have specifically reminded the staff on the change of our pickup time. She seemed to understand but I guess not. When we got back to the hotel later, we approached the concierge 30mins prior to the rescheduled pickup time ie 730pm to only discovered no call was made to the pickup earlier. 
The hotel was running fullhouse as its near xmas + new year so there were many guests at the lobby. I'm sitting in the lobby waiting for the pickup with my no brand shopping bags. After.an hour, a female caucasian staff stood in front speaking to a local staff that it was unacceptable to have my shopping bags being put there and immediately have the staff removing my bags. No issue on wanting to maintain their standard 5 star image but its the manner and approach thats totally uncalled for. As a 5 star hotel, that staff was down right rude to treat a hotel guest that way and I am very disappointed that my hols ended with a bad experience at the hotel. Its as if I've committed a crime. That will be the last 5 nights at this property. My bad for ignoring my friend's recommendation to stay at Conrad or ShangriLa.

1,REDACTED,en,2331,"I stayed here for two nights and I have to say this is quite possibly the best hotel I have stayed at.

I arrived at about 730PM from Narita Airport on a direct shuttle bus so check in was a bit busy when I arrived as my fellow travelers got to the desk before me, but I had to wait no more than 5 minutes since it appears that additional staff members were called to help. The staff member who was directing guests to available check in agents was very attentive, and offered to take my luggage, jacket, and my carry-all while I waited to check in. The check-in staff were nothing short of fantastic. Ridiculously polite, the staff member took time to review my hotel rate, explain where hotel facilities were, and let me know about the Shinjuku Station shuttle schedule. The agent asked if I would like help to my room, which I declined, however when I turned around after finishing up the same staff member who took my luggage items and coat was waiting for me, with all my items in hand, and helped me towards the elevators.

My room was on the tenth floor, and when I arrived I was just as impressed as when I first walked into the hotel. The room looked like it had been recently renovated and refreshed as everything was crisp and clean. It was very well lit, smelled fresh, and had some great furnishings including a nice large closet for my cloths and two reasonable sized drawers. I was pleasantly surprised to find some slippers and a Japanese style robe in one of the drawers, very comfortable to be in after walking around Tokyo all day!

The bathroom was just as clean and crisp and amazing as the rest of the room and was well stocked with towels and amenities. I was a bit thrown off by the lack of a shower curtain, there was just a bit of glass close to the shower head, but after a bit of figuring it out was able to not spray water all over the place! The mirror was also slightly heated so when you had a hot shower part of it stayed clear and did not fog up. The toilet had once of the fancy bidet attachments on that also heated up however I did not use it.

One thing that I was amazed about was how quiet everything was. I had the air conditioner working and was concerned that it might be broken but it cooled and heated just fine. I did not hear anything from either of the adjacent rooms (not even a TV) when I was in my room, and never heard anything from the hall.

I did not get a chance to use the restaurants or spa at the hotel, but when I did walk by the breakfast buffet it did look amazing. (I opted to go eat like a local and go find the tiny restaurants for a quick bite to eat here and there and I highly recommend it if you want to try more traditional Japanese cuisine)

The one thing about this hotel that topped it all off for me was the staff(and i touched on it at the beginning of this review). As a Canadian who has worked in the customer service industry for 15+ years I always considered myself as someone who provided very good customer service. The staff at the hotel have given me a new bar to reach - I was completely blown away by each and every staff member who I talked to. EVERYONE greeted or acknowledged me in some fashion, even if it was just a quick hello. If I had a question to ask, I always felt as if they took ownership to find me an answer even if they had to ask for help. When I left one of the mornings the concierge asked me if I needed directions anywhere and when I informed him I was just going shopping it turned into a 5 minute info session about the best shops to go see - both high end and hidden gems. Everyone was fantastic.

Overall I give this hotel a 5/5 and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Tokyo. It is not a cheap hotel to stay at but if it is within your budget it is a no brainer!

Note: When I checked out I was talking to a fellow guest who said that he was on the same side of the hotel but quite a bit higher up (30th floor I think), and the view was even more amazing than his previous stay on the lower floors so try and request a room higher up!",5,2013/12/18
1,REDACTED,en,2332,"My second stay.
This hotel has a great location in Shinjuku, easy access to Metro system. Rooms are modern and views are stunning. Service all around is on par at the rate charged. 
Only problem I faced was the service in Marble Lounge, where breakfast is served. Self service buffet style, with good variety. You might need to ask a few times for coffee to be served. Dinner service was poor, waited twice about 45 minutes for dinner, when there was hardly anyone in the restaurant.
I will certainly recommend the hotel, just have patience when it come to food.",4,2013/12/15
1,REDACTED,en,2333,"This hotel is aways busy, so be prepared to wait a while when checking in and checking out.
Staff is attentive and friendly when you get to speak to one. They are always super busy!
Don't leave booking your seat on the airport shuttle to the last minute because it gets booked out quickly! Ask reception to book it for you as soon as you know which time and date you require. 
My favourite thing about the hotel is the breakfast spread which is always very great!",4,2013/12/14
1,REDACTED,en,2334,I've stayed in many Hiltons so I'm aware the standards vary (for the properties as opposed to service) and this wasn't one of the best. A great spot with a lovely reception and staff however tired rooms which makes it poor value compared to other hotels available. I'd probably go back but wouldn't pay over the odds.,3,2013/12/14
1,REDACTED,en,2335,"First time to stay in this hotel and I have spent 4 nights there just a week ago for shopping. Nice hotel with pleasant staff who are helpful with good English. Room nice and clean. Convenient shuttle bus to and from Shinjuku Station. However I have 3 points for their rooms of improvement. i) As I have the experience of different Japan hotels (even 3 star) with sufficient bath amenties(big bottle of shampoo/bath soap), I did not take any shampoo/bath soap this time. But I found the very small bottle of soap in the room, insufficient for 2 persons. Request were made to housekeeping on the 1st night and even I bought the bath soap from outside on the 2nd day; ii) No free wifi and internet in the room but only in the lobby, nowadays it is very common to have free access of wifi/internet in any hotel but Hilton demands extra charge; and iii) I bought 2 boxes of raw beef and asked the concierge for frozen 2 days till my check out. Very disappointed of it because the staff only kept my boxes of beef in the normal fridge without freezed. The beef turned black upon my arrival of home. Famous Hilton is beyond my expectation.",3,2013/12/13
1,REDACTED,en,2336,"Third time staying here. My comment is not as good as before.

The hotel didn't change much. Rooms are nice, service quality maintained, except for the front desk.

At check in, front desk staff proactively told me (before I asked) that the executive room were fully booked so that he was sorry that I cannot receive upgrade there. However, when I check the hotel availability on that day after going up to my room, I found that every type of executive room was available for booking.

I understand that the hotel have its own policy for upgrading. I also know what to expect for room I receive. I'm fine if you just tell me I'm not going to get an executive room upgrade, but I cannot accept being cheated, especially using such excuse which guest could easily find out what the truth is. Guests are not idiots, especially for those who travel frequently.

It's not the first time I was treated like this in Hilton properties in Japan. But strange enough this only happened to me in Japan. These made me started to feel disappointed to HHonors. Maybe I was just out of luck? Not sure. But I am sure that I will try another hotel chain as I received better treatment when I stayed with them in Japan.",2,2013/12/12
1,REDACTED,en,2337,"One of the things with Hilton is you can be pretty certain of what your getting, when visiting somewhere as Culturally different as Japan that's sometimes useful when just arriving. This is a well positioned big busy hotel in Western Tokyo. The staff are helpful and the rooms good and the hotel is on the airport shuttle route and also provides its own free shuttle to Shinjuku station.
One of the irritating things about Hilton is its charge for wifi- its free in Starbucks across the road and it was the only Hotel in Japan I stayed in that charged- and that includes a Ryokan!",4,2013/12/09
1,REDACTED,en,2338,"""Initially we chose this hotel while staying in the city because we had already booked our last 3 nights at Hilton Tokyo Bay and we had heard about the luggage transfer service from the two hotels, which would make our travel so much easier. So we did get our luggage transferred (for US$10 per piece) and it was very convenient as it arrived on the same day. Plus we could do our last sightseeing in the city then moved to the Tokyo Bay area by train with only our day packs. Another reason for staying here is because it was referred to us by my best friend who lives 3 minutes away from the hotel. She had mentioned how convenient it will be for our family to travel away from Shinjuku by train as the hotel's basement is connected to the Nishi-Shinjuku station. We always used the trains and at the end of each day it was really nice to walk in the warmth of that basement walkway as it got so much colder at night. We booked a standard room and got randomly upgraded to a newly refurbished room! Not only the room looks very stylish with a super comfy bed and pillows, it also features an amazing view of Shinjuku's skyscraper. The service was outstanding and staff were very friendly, as with everyone else we met in Japan.""",5,2013/12/08
1,REDACTED,en,2339,"Cannot believe they get away with charging what they do for this hotel. And then, on top of this, if you want to use wifi in the rooms YOU HAVE TO PAY EXTRA FOR IT. In 2013. Couldn't believe it. If this was ever a luxury hotel, it certainly isn't by today's standards. 
That said, the staff were lovely and attentive, but the rooms just simply aren't worth the price.",2,2013/12/07
1,REDACTED,en,2340,"I stayed 2 weeks at this hotel in Dec 2013. Its my first stay in Japan so I have no other reference. However, I cannot fault this hotel in any way. The ground floor restaurant was excellent, room service was prompt with wide selection 24 hrs, service staff were always courteous and helpful. The gym/spa was well equipped and the pool was warm and pristine. Had 2 great massages too. All in all I think this was the most pleasant hotel stay I have ever experienced. I would gladly stay here again.",5,2013/12/07
1,REDACTED,en,2341,"This is a big busy international hotel. The rooms are good and the staff helpful and all speak English well. Shinjuku is a good base in Tokyo. The breakfast area is very noisy with loud music playing all the time. This can be a bit off-putting. Overall a slick Hilton chain hotel where you get what you expect, if you are looking for character and or a boutique style experience this is not the hotel for you.",4,2013/12/07
1,REDACTED,en,2342,"Stayed for two nights. Hotel shuttle running to and from Shinjuku station ( about 15 mins if you walk ).We normally try and avoid having breakfast in the hotel but there were hardly any eateries in the immediate vicinity so had to eat in. Having said that, the hotel offers an excellent breakfast buffet with a good spread of Japanese and western selections. 
Comfortable and quiet room with a view of the nearby offices. No complimentary bottle of water so had to buy our own from Shinjuku because the tap water tastes funny ( and why pay the exhorbitant price for bottled water from the mini bar). 
We were catching a bullet train from Tokyo to Kyoto and didn't want to be laden with luggage so we made use of the onward delivery services ( chargeable) arranged through the helpful concierge. Note that If you send it on the same day that you leave you have to pack some overnight clothes because it only arrives a day later. All in all an enjoyable stay at Hilton Tokyo.",4,2013/12/06

1,REDACTED,en,2344,"This is really a superb hotel! We stayed in this set up for 5 nights in a King size executive room from 28 November 2013 to 3 December 2013 (out of our 10 nights stay of our tour in Japan). 

Nothing beats the location of this hotel, which is right in front of the Metro subway station, Nishi-Shinjuku. The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to and from hotel to the Shinjuku Station and The Shinjuku Skyscraper District is a 5-minute walk from the hotel, pampered and surroundedby big and sizeable shopping malls. A few steps from the places of interest. We love the club & premier floor which we stayed for the entire 5 nights, the staff is most attentive with excellent service especially Manager Goto-san from the minute we checked. Thereafter, they remember our room ""1929"" and said in Japanese everytime we walked in. There is direct picked up service from the hotel concierge for the day trips, which we took up to join the Mount Fuji/Hakone tour and Nikko. The direct airport limousine from the hotel costs Yen 12,000 Adult and yen 600 for child, is most handy. Do visit the spa and gym if you have time, it was really nice.

Best part there were no additional charges for breakfast for my 12-year old daughter whom join us for the trip, the server obliged her fresh milk request every night. The stay also comes with free wifi.

The executive lounge offers great variety of canapé, fruits, juices and alcoholic beverages. Breakfast at the club has a better ambience compared of at the main café, called the Marble Lounge. One thing worth mentioning is that we can sight Mount Fuji from the lounge in a clear day.
All in all, the experience has been good, and I applauded the service and attentive of Mr. Goto and team.",5,2013/12/04
1,REDACTED,en,2345,"I had to go to Tokyo and spend 10 days over the spring during the Cherry Blossom festival and ended up staying at the Hilton in Shinjuku. This property is truly class A compared to other Hiltons I have stayed in the US and other locations and its as good as it gets. The breakfast in the Executive lounge is fantastic, there's typical japanese food and for those that need something more familiar there's your typical American breakfast as well. Plus free drinks and finger food all evenings. And the view is fantastic, it's located over the 30th floor (not sure the exact floor, but it was high). The rooms are standard for what you'd expect of a $300+ a night hotel, luxurious, and kudos to the cleanliness, comfort of the bed and the great shower. Very attentive staff who really made my stay effortless. In terms of location, one can't ask for better: It's less than a block to the Tokyo subway from where you can reach virtually anywhere in Tokyo and connect to the whole of Japan if you'd like (there are extremely fast trains you can get to go to other places on a day trip and come back on time for the evening drinks with your friends - in the VIP lounge, of course). If you can choose a time of the year to go, the Cherry Blossoms are awesome in Japan in the Spring, truly amazing and it's worth to visit Ueno park. Nearby the hotel there's lots of shops and native restaurants in the Shinjuku district nearby the rail lines. A particular delicacy is the Yakitori, you'll find lots of variety in different restaurants in the area. I went on this trip mostly for business and not expecting much, but Tokyo can really surprise you as being an amazing tourist destination with lots of things to do.",5,2013/12/04
1,REDACTED,en,2346,Hilton Tokyo has excellent customer service. Hotel is located in Tokyo Shinjuku area which is close to nearby districts. Shinjuku is a nice place for shopping and night life also. Only thing which you can't get free in this hotel is internet and mineral water. They charge for room internet and there is no complimentary mineral water. If you are Hilton Honors gold member then you can get these for free.,4,2013/12/03
1,REDACTED,en,2347,"My colleague and I travel for business and have stayed on the Executive Floor of the Hilton Hotels in Japan, Colombia and Buenos Aires. There is no consistency in the rules at any of these hotels and during our recent stay from 8 - 13 October we both stayed on the Executive Floor with use of the Executive Lounge a the Hilton Hotel, Tokyo.

On our fourth night at the hotel, upon leaving the Executive Lounge, we were stopped and told by one of the staff that our footwear was not appropriate for this Lounge. We were both wearing the brand of Fit Flops, the weather in Japan being unseasonably warm and I had only this type of footwear with me on my trip. I also wore this brand of footwear during a trip in May 2013 and we had previously stayed at the Hilton in Osaka on the Executive Floor, used the Executive Lounge and no comments had been made about our footwear. In fact, no comments re our footwear have been made in any of the other Hilton Hotels we have stayed in.

We were extremely offended by this and I emailed Helen Jacobe, Director of Operations, at the Hilton Tokyo to share this with her. Also I was extremely disappointed and offended with the attitude of the Duty Manager on duty that evening. We met with the Director of Operations and I acknowledged to her that I have no problem with rules, but this type of rule needs to be communicated with the customer before they start out on their trip so they can meet the dresscode, not when they are at the hotel. And of course, there is no excuse for a member of management to be patronising and condescending to paying guests.

We also wondered what type of atmosphere and image the Hilton are trying to portray for their Executive Lounge, as certainly in Tokyo, there were children as young as 2/3, dropping food on the floor, running around - not really conducive to an executive environment. In addition, there were many other guests wearing, in my opinion, inappropriate dress for an Executive Lounge and certainly wearing beach flip flops and sandals, which according to the dresscode are not allowed. We felt that we had been dicriminated against, and were extremely surprised that the Hilton brand would treat their customers in this way.

My colleague and I are both of the opinion that it is very doubtful we will stay at the Hilton again, certainly the Tokyo Hilton, unless we can receive some strong assurances that Hilton Hotels will be training their staff in equality and diversity, and that the principles of their rules and dresscode are enforced equally to offenders.

I look forward to receiving your response to this complaint, which unfortunately is the second I have written in a year to complain about a Hilton Hotel. I have also sent this complaint to your Hilton Worldwide website some 2 months ago and received no response.",3,2013/12/02

1,REDACTED,en,2351,"Overall I was pleased with my experience at the Tokyo Hilton and even considered it a nicer experience then Hiltons in the US or South America. If you want the benefit of a stunning view of Tokyo and maybe even Mount Fuji then make sure you get as high of a floor as possible (20+). The food at the restaurants are very good. The lobby has a quality breakfast and lunch buffet and the mezzanine restaurants are exceptional although pricey. They offered us a breakfast and internet package, just make sure you are clear as to the pricing being per day or for the entire duration of your stay. Also be sure to check out the Japanese style bath next to the gym. My only gripe would be about the bathrooms being very dated. They look like they have not been remodeled since the 60s.",4,2013/11/26
1,REDACTED,en,2352,"There were very few rooms available in Tokyo for my last-minute booking and this was an executive room which was large and well appointed in traditional Japanese style, albeit expensive. The shower was large and the shower pressure was amazing - I realize water and bathing are important to the Japanese and it really was a Zen experience to have a shower there - no wimpy US 3 gpm showerheads here. Upon return from Kyoto, we again stayed at the Hilton, this time in a regular room and it was just a regular shower that was in the tub but the pressure was still excellent. The buffet was great, we had it twice - wide variety - great eggs made to order at the omelet station. We never normally get room service as we like to dine out but Jet-lag was rough and we had dinner twice in the room - surprisingly excellent - it comes up in heated cabinets and was well prepared, even Italian pasta - and we are foodies by nature and very discriminating. The wifi is not free but with a package with breakfast, it was about 10 dollars a day. It was quiet fast and I was able to stream my TV shows from home via my slingbox at full def without problems, which was good since the english choices on TV were practically nonexistent. Near the lobby, there was free computer use with internet access and linked to a laser printer to print emails like boarding passes. The hotel is on the quiet side of the Shinjuku station but if the weather is good, it's a short walk to the action, otherwise take advantage of the free Hilton shuttle that runs 3 times an hour to the station. As always in Japan, everyone was exceptionally polite and accommodating.",5,2013/11/26
1,REDACTED,en,2353,"I stayed here for two weeks on business. My routine was as follows: I would get up 5:30am looking over the sunrise in Tokyo, go to the swimming pool at 6am, and jump into a large Japanese style public bath tub next to the gym, and down to the lobby for an excellent breakfast buffet to enjoy traditional Japanese breakfast (you get other options, such as western or Chinese styles). Some folks say the service is as great as other hotels, but I found them extremely friendly and helpful in a Japanese way (not lots of plastic smiles in the western way, they were genuinely sincere). I have stayed at other Hilton hotels around the world, but this one was as good as others. A good portion of the guests were non-Japanese here. Being a Japanese myself, I felt like this was a bubble. If you are on business, that's great. If you want to get to know the Japanese culture, this place offers little of it. It's only a 12-minute walking distance to the Shinjuku station, which is the busiest train station in the world. Some people complain about the location a bit out of the way, but I think those folks are just spoiled in my opinion.",5,2013/11/26

1,REDACTED,en,2356,"Was going to be in Tokyo for work for a few days so my partner and I flew in a couple days early. My work hotel was in Roppongi so we wanted to check out a different part of town for a couple days and decided on the Hilton Tokyo in Shinjuku. The hotel itself was very nice. Room was a good size, quite spartan in the furnishings with a low fairly uncomfortable couch. The bed was comfortable and the room was spotless, which are really the only two requirements for us. 

One thing that I did love about the room was the A/C. Most hotel rooms have an A/C or heater with a blower that does just that, it blows air in a noisy fashion. This usually is a nuisance in the middle of the night as a noisy fan comes on and off. This one was silent. It's a weird thing that sometimes annoys me and this one was so quiet and added to the peacefulness of the room. Even though our room was right next to the elevator we never heard any noise from the hallway which was also nice. 

The only downside to this hotel is that it's a bit out of the way. We tend to walk and use subways when we're visiting a new city and this hotel, while not super far from the subway stations, was about a 10 minute walk in each way so we always had to factor that into it. Especially over to Shinjuku station. Regardless, it was convenient to pretty much anywhere that we wanted to to. Glad we stayed there, well worth the money.",4,2013/11/25

The bathroom however was dated and very small/ cluttered for the size of the room and I did not like it at all. It's a shame that the bathrooms seem an afterthought. The gym too is very small for the size of the hotel, so is the pool. The location is a bit remote but did not bother me much. Wifi was reliable and room service tasty and well priced. The breakfast at the lobby had a good selection of Japanese and Western choices, with delicious bread and pastries. Among the hotel restaurants, the Dynasty Chinese restaurant was exceptional. Though a bit pricey, the course menu was excellent. As expected I did not get access to the executive lounge as a gold member. One hick up was that after I returned home I noted an errorneous mini bar charge of about 4000 yen. I failed to catch it during the check out as my statement was pretty long.

Checking in the staff were very friendly and answered lots of my questions about the hotel and surround area. Everyone I encountered whether its the restaurants, bar, security or bellman were very friendly and helped with any questions I answered.

Very expensive meals. The location is not conducive to anything but business meetings in the government offices. We should have wised up when they offer a FREE shuttle to Shinjuku station!! Would not stay in this area again - found Shiodome area far better as a sightseer, however should qualify this - if you are into nightlife, this area would be better at night no doubt, but everything is a taxi ride away, it is not walkable in ""heels"".

1,REDACTED,en,2362,A good Hotel with nice rooms - the suites are lovely! The staff is extremely polite and helpful and readily help you for anything you need in the city. We had a conference there and found the food and facilities excellent. Breakfast was great. A little out of the main city - no shopping nearby although taxis in Tokyo are safe and easy to get. All in all an enjoyable stay.,4,2013/11/18
1,REDACTED,en,2363,"First time I have stayed here after traveling to Japan on business for over 18 years. This is an excellent hotel in every aspect. Easily reachable from Narita on Airport Limo Bus, and close to Shinjuku Station if you can navigate subway system. Check-in was fast and efficient. Room on 14th floor was obviously recently renovated, so it was a very nice space (large by Japanese hotel standards), modern, and comfortable. Every staff person I encountered was extremely friendly, helpful, and the English skills of this staff was excellent - by far the best English-speaking skills of any Tokyo hotel staff I've ever experienced. Many options for dining in the hotel if you chose to stay in. I dined at Musashino after an early-evening arrival from the US, and the sushi was very good. Well-equipped gym facility. Executive floor lounge is very nice, large, well-stocked, and breakfast was excellent. Again, staff here is extremely friendly and caring. I travel to Japan only 4-times a year now, but I will be back here on my upcoming/return visits. Not sure if this property is the Japan flagship hotel for Hilton since their first hotel was in Tokyo in '63 - but, congrats to Hilton Japan on this property and their 50 years in Japan.",5,2013/11/16
1,REDACTED,en,2364,"I recently stayed at the hotel for a 4 day business trip and booked into an executive room. The last time I stayed I was on a lower floor and the difference with the executive rooms are they are on higher levels. I did not recall there being any difference in the room itself other than I benefited from free WIFI.

The hotel is just a short walk from the Shinjuku shopping area and plenty of places to eat.

My experience of the executive club room was mixed. I believe the hotel was full and each time I visited, I had to wait quite a while for a table to be seated. Late Sunday afternoon it was extremely busy as the evening drinks and food were available, so it seemed like most of the executive room guests were there. I did have breakfast in the executive room one morning, but decided that ground floor breakfast area offered a much better option. 

My stay was very comfortable and I am looking forward to returning.",4,2013/11/16
1,REDACTED,en,2365,"Superb accommodations, great views from the higher floor rooms, excellent service and an outstanding executive floor lounge make this property my favorite. I've stayed here twice and the only small complaint I have is the time it took to check in for my most recent stay (not due to waiting in line but because of all the paperwork). I'm not sure why this hotel does not have checkin in the executive lounge for elite HH members as does the Hilton in Beijing, or if they do, why we weren't offered that option. But, even this issue was not enough to knock this hotel off the top of my list. Admittedly, there could be a nicer Tokyo hotel out there, but as long as the Hilton Tokyo keeps doing what they're doing, there will be no reason for me to find out.",5,2013/11/14

I need to add in the names of the lines later but it was very convenient. Service was great - Concierge spoke English fluently and the hotel staff was very attentive and kind. 

They have a great gym and offer GREAT massages after a day of exploring the city. Highly recommend if you can afford it - we were able to use Hilton Honors points thankfully and it was worth every single point!!!! 

Strongly recommend.",5,2013/11/14

This hotel is very well localized, near to many attractions and easy walking distance from Shinjuku train station.

1,REDACTED,en,2369,"I stayed in the Hilton in Shinjuku for 2 weeks recently. The hotel was really excellent. As you would expect from a hotel of this class in Tokyo, everything worked like clockwork. Because I was there so long, I got a long stay discount (20% off laundry and hotel restaurants). The food in the Checkers restaurant was excellent. But, most of all, the staff were all SO friendly. By my third day there they remembered my name and room number. I had a brief problem with the Internet one day, and I don't know how many of the staff apologized over that (even though I didn't complain - I simply rang to let them know). The air conditioning worked really well, there was no wait on the elevators (I was on the 36th floor), there is a regular free shuttle to Shinjuku station, regular buses directly to Narita and Hanea airports.... everything just worked perfectly. I can't wait to go back.",5,2013/11/11
1,REDACTED,en,2370,"I stayed in this Hotel from Nov. 3-7, 2013. The hotel lobby was crazy busy in the mornings. However, the hotel seemed pretty used to this level of people and seemed to handle it very well. Their efficiency is most apparent during breakfast where everyone on deck was helping out to find seats for early morning diners.

The concierge was very helpful when I requested for information on transportation. They were also kind enough to fill out on my behalf, forms that were written in Japanese and had no translation.

The room I had was large, with a desk and a lounge chair. It was quite comfortable and afforded views of the city skyline and the park behind the hotel.

Check in and check out was a breeze. I was advised (without my asking) that luggage I had sent from Osaka, already arrived and would be delivered to my room. They also had a straight through check out process which allowed me to just drop off my key without passing through the cashier. The hotel also provides a complimentary shuttle to and from Shinjuku station.

The breakfast buffet was extensive and tasty.

Overall, the hotel provided good value for its convenient location in Shinjuku.",3,2013/11/11
1,REDACTED,en,2371,"This Hilton provided excellent service and a very positive experience. It is located within easy walking distance from the Shinjuku train station, and convenient to many restaurants and shops. The rooms are small but typical of Tokyo, and are very modern and clean. The staff are excellent, and responded to every request. Restaurants are a bit pricey but the food was good, and especially the breakfast buffet.

1,REDACTED,en,2372,"Booked a deal well in advance for buy 2 nights get one free, but my overwhelming impression was that it wouldn't have been worth the full room rate. Our room had a very dated bathroom despite the website seeming to say all rooms had been fully refurbished. I found the service slightly impersonal - staff weren't able to respond to my requests for, for example, an early check in. Also breakfast is in the very busy public lobby which isn't a particularly pleasant place to be, especially given the cost of the buffet. I imagine there are better choices in Tokyo.",3,2013/11/11
1,REDACTED,en,2373,"Stayed there during my last business trip to Japan. I'm more of a Starwood person but needed the hotel in the area. The location is good - next to the metro station and shopping district. The room was very clean and looked like new. The breakfast, as other people mentioned, has lots of choices but the area can be crowded during morning rush hours. You may end up waiting in line for a table. Little things like wifi and drinking water in the room are charged separately for those like me who doesn't have lots of Hilton points.
I also used in-room dining service one day - the delivery took about 15 mins and the food was great. Pretty good on my scale. The person who checked me in - Ms Legcova - was very helpful with volunteering all the tidbits like locations of business areas with free wifi and so on. She even escorted me to the elevator and pressed the button. I travel a lot and I don't think any check-in person pressed the elevator button for me before. Good job. :)",4,2013/11/09
1,REDACTED,en,2374,"The common areas, lobby etc are excellent. I had the good fortune of an upgrade to a junior suite, thanks to my Diamond HH status, but the room was disappointingly basic, although very spacious, esp for tight Tokyo real estate. Very ordinary furniture, desk and trimmings. Bathrooms tiny, old and tired, overdue for a makeover. Out of synch with the rather fresh lobby, and an excellent exec lounge on 37F. 

The Marble Lounge downstairs is a bit of a zoo over breakfast, much preferred the more limited menu, but dignified setting in the exec lounge upstairs.

Cabs are easy enough to get around in, and always available at the door. I did notice, but didn't use this time, a subway station (Hiltopia?) right beneath the hotel which is convenient. 

Getting to any hotel from Narita is a challenge, it takes forever given the distance. The Narita Airport express is great, but suggest take the limo bus instead...similar time and expense. Lugging a suitcase for what seemed like miles in the stations at both ends just wasn't worth it. Shinjuku station s very crowded, tho taxis are easily available, and the Hilton,s shuttle service every 20 mins is rather good...check the times, the frequency changes with the time of day.",3,2013/11/09
1,REDACTED,en,2375,"Stayed in Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku in October-2013 for 3 nights. Convenient limobus transfers from hotel to Handa/Narita airports. Took us 30mins from Haneda at 10pm. Quick check-in process. English speaking people at check in and concierge. I have a Hilton Gold card but did not get a room upgrade. However was given free room WIFI and breakfast at the lobby. Room was spacious and clean. Ample storage/closet space. Could do with more power sockets nearer bed. Comfy bed and my pre check in requests for more towels and pillows were accomodated. Free bus shuttle to Shinjuku station (10min walking distance away). Alternatively the nearest subway station is Nishi Shinjuku, a 2 min walk away from the left hand side of the hotel. Good breakfast buffet spread at lobby with Japanese and Western dishes - loved the smoothies and french toast! If on vacation go for breakfast after 9am to avoid the business crowd. Free WIFI at lobby and breakfast area too. Cool business center at ground floor with Apple Macs. Didn't use the fitness center but had a peek - clean and modern equipment; good size indoor lap pool ; Japanese-style bath/tub in locker room. All staff were very pleasant, courteous and professional at all times. In the neighbourhood: Convenience stores across the street in basement; Shinjuku park a 2 min walk away.",4,2013/11/08
1,REDACTED,en,2376,"First and foremost, it was just so nice to arrive at this elegant hotel after a 14 hour flight from New York. As we had a room in the higher floors, we had excellent views of the city which were even prettier at night when all the lights were on. The rooms were really spacious, beautifully furnished and decorated. The beds were just absolutely comfortable. As for the breakfast spread, I can't even begin to sing their praises. It was marvelous! Lots of choices and really delicious to boot. Somehow, they also periodically spray the lobby area with this really nice smelling fragrance such that it was almost like a ""welcome home"" every time we entered the building from a day of sightseeing. The concierge were tremendously helpful with directions and providing us with maps as well as navigating their overwhelming subway system. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel in Tokyo. Yes, it's pricey but you get what you pay for. Besides, I don't think ""cheap"" is in Tokyo's vocabulary.",5,2013/11/08

There is tremendous choice of different dishes at the breakfast, amazing windows views, huge gym with many machines and dumbbells like in normal sports club, swimming pool and very cosy spa with rest area. I can ask any questions related to Tokyo at the reception and English speaking staff explain in details what to visit and what to do.

1,REDACTED,en,2378,"Stayed at the Shinjuku Hilton Hotel in June, for one night just to get away for a night with a friend. Really can not say anything negative about the Hilton Hotel in Shinjuku, thought it was far from the train station but they had the convenient shuttle bus.
From the check in, to the room, to the overnight stay, to the great breakfast things went perfectly during this stay.
You should by all means try to get the rooms that include the Executive lounge, the staff were so friendly and the food was excellent.
Although it was raining that day I spent most of my time just relaxing in the hotel room, I slept so well that night.
Would I go back definetly, would I recommend to others yes very much.",5,2013/11/07
1,REDACTED,en,2379,"This was my first trip to Japan. The Hilton was in a very good central location and had bus pickup service directly from the airport for 3000 Yen which is a great deal compared to a cab. The hotel buses run exactly on time, both to the airport and to the major train station and shopping mall. The hotel room was large, had a very good bathroom with a defogging mirror, makeup mirror and upgraded warm seat/bidet toilet. The room also included a mini bar, lots of closet space, a safe, and good lighting. Check-in was great. Somehow when the airport bus unloaded, about 10 new reservationists appeared to help with the check-in. The service in the lobby to also top rate, whether you needed help with buses, taxis, directions, etc. They will loan you an umbrella as well. The buffet breakfast had about everything from miso soup, to dumplings to traditional bacon and eggs. WIFI in the hotel is slow in the mornings and evenings when there is a high demand on the network. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013/11/06
1,REDACTED,en,2380,"The Hilton is located in an area of Shinjuku surrounded by office towers and is roughly a five-minute drive from Shinjuku train station. The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle to the station so it made commuting easier. Also, the hotel limo bus stops right at the hotel, which is a bonus if you don't want to lug your luggage looking for directions to your hotel.

We booked in one of the revamped rooms, which contained modern décor and was fairly spacious by Japanese standards, with lots of drawers/storage space. The hotel provided amenities like kimono-style robes (nice touch), slippers and coffee/tea. Staff were friendly and all spoke very good English. International television channels were pretty much nil. We were able to nab a discounted rate so I was satisfied with our choice to stay there and while it was a pleasant stay, the hotel was large, busy and lacked personality. I probably wouldn't seek this hotel out the next time I'm in Tokyo.",4,2013/11/05
1,REDACTED,en,2381,"Stayed here with my wife and in-laws. The staff is uber-friendly. The breakfast is simply out of this world, with a huge selection of Japanese and Western choices. The atmosphere is friendly, clean, pleasant, very welcoming, from the door[wo]men and all the way to the executive lounge on the 37th floor. The latter is very private, well appointed, with great views - especially to the West - and a very good selection of food and drinks. My favorite, the espresso machine!
The newly renovated rooms on the 19th floor are great, particularly the fireman pressure showers!
No need to lavish praise on the famous Japanese toilets. They ""speak"" for themselves.
The concierge staff is super attentive, booking our restaurants, and helping direct taxi drivers to the right destination. 
The free and frequent shuttle to Shinjuku railway station (right next to the shopping and the red light / entertainment district) is a great bonus.
You can also walk there as it is not far.

Concierge helpful and one of the young managers who was from New Zealand was lovely. Not a lot of seating area in foyer unless you want to buy a drink. All in all a good starting base for a holiday in Tokyo.",4,2013/11/04
1,REDACTED,en,2384,"This was our 2nd trip this year to Japan and we opted to stay in Hilton Shinjuku Hotel.
We were given free upgrade from Junior Suite to an Executive Suite due to the fully booked status at the time of our stay. Great gesture from the hotel.
Room - Very spacious but the interior of the room is kinda dark, due to the dark coloured wood panelled furnitures.
The downside of the room is the lack of wall power points , especially near the bathroom where the mirror is. Would really appreciate if the hotel could look into putting more wall power points around the room, especially since it is a suite room.
Breakfast spread at the lobby restaurant was above average, I was hoping for a wide variety of Japanese breakfast spread, slightly disappointed though.
Background music at the restaurant area was a pretty hip and cool touch to kick start the day with.
It is a distance to walk to the train station as it can get pretty complicated to find your way in Japan . Would recommend this hotel for couple with no kids as the distance to walk to even a nearest mini-mart is not as easy as you could get with some other better location hotels.
As a couple, we liked the walk anyway.",4,2013/11/04
1,REDACTED,en,2385,"Arrived well before check in time but got room right away. This was appreciated as well as the efficient and friendly check in process.

Room was fairly large, but somewhat dated.

Got access to Executive lounge which was great. Service level and food/drinks were of high quality.

Hotel is located within walking distance to Shinjuku train station. Hilton offers also a free shuttle bus to the station. From Shinjuku you can easily access everywhere.

Service level of staff was high.

All in all a great stay. Good hotel with good location. I would definetely come again.",4,2013/11/03
1,REDACTED,en,2386,"We stayed at this hotel for a week. We can confirm what other reviewers have said that the lobby is always busy. The lifts can be very busy too, at times. Check in was pretty quick, and the staff, majority of them, are able to converse in English sufficiently. Our suitcases were also handled quickly. The room itself, being a standard, is spacious for Asian standard with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom, on the other hand, needs face lift rather urgently. The hotel provides a regular shuttle service between Shinjuku station and the hotel. To walk to the station, it'll take 15 minutes walk, which we really enjoyed. However, the 1.2 to 1.5 km distance may not be suitable for some people, so the shuttle is quite popular. Around the hotel there are plenty of restaurants and convenience stores. There is also a private subway line, nishishinjuku, around 300 meters from the hotel. One other thing I really like is the ice Cube machine at every floor. I find it really handy.

In summary, the hotel provides good service, clean and modern room. The staff are very professional and they dress really well. Highly recommended. I would've given 5 out of 5 if it wasn't due to the old bathroom.",4,2013/11/03
1,REDACTED,en,2387,"There are countless hotel choices in Tokyo and many fine areas to stay, but we wanted to be in or close to Shinjuku and the Hilton proved to be an excellent choice for our 5-night stay. The Hilton is a great choice for exploring Shinjuku, but it's also a convenient place to stay if you plan to tour all over Tokyo. What I mean is that it's a 10-15 minute walk from Shinjuku Station, a very convenient transportation hub for getting around Tokyo, but also just less than 10 minutes should you wish to use the subway. The walk is great on a nice day, but in rainy or cold weather, you can take the subway to Shinjuku Station without even going outside. You go through the lobby, past the main restaurant, and downstairs to walk to the subway. And near Shinjuku Station, don't miss the wonderful Takashimaya department store, principally the amazing basement level food area.

The Tokyo subway is very easy to use - machines have a button for English language and trains have signs and announcements in English. At any train station, you should also be able to pick up an English language subway map. I highly recommend using the subway when touring Tokyo - easy to use and even using the subway you'll still likely be walking several miles a day.

But back to the Hilton, I found the hotel very functional. It's a very large hotel, one that I would typically avoid in the US because I find the waits for the elevator to be long and the crowds too big. But I never experienced any of this at this Hilton. 

More importantly, while I typically don't use concierge services, I absolutely did at the Hilton because of the language barrier making dinner reservations (I don't speak Japanese). Now you might think with such a large hotel that you would have long waits to speak to a concierge, but that was never the case. And we even communicated with the concierge by email well before our arrival in Tokyo to make some hard-to-get dinner reservations. The concierge was truly outstanding and willing to go great lengths to secure a dinner reservation and to make sure you knew how to get there, what to wear, and how much time to allow.

Our guest room was very comfortable. I appreciate a firm mattress and nice bedding and they certainly offered that. Air conditioning worked just fine. There's a safe in the room too. Also, you don't need converters or adapters. Wi-fi worked very well (note: free for me since I'm Hilton Gold). The bathroom was just fine too and the shower had great water pressure.

There really wasn't anything I disliked about the Hilton, though I thought the breakfast buffet was not quite as good as a couple of others I experienced on this trip (in Osaka and Kyoto). The Japanese offerings were not my favorites or particularly impressive (not a natto fan, that's for sure). And the western offerings were fine but very ordinary - eggs, omelets, french toast, bacon, sausage, breads, fruits, etc. There are a few pastries which I though were pretty lousy actually. I would have preferred to just get a bowl of fruit and then go out to eat but my travel companion seems to love buffet breakfasts. That's okay - I still enjoyed multiple bowls of ramen (at Tokyo's Ramen Street). I'll also note that occasionally I had to wait a few minutes for a table here - not a big deal, but surprisingly the only place where the largeness of the hotel perhaps came into play.

A few other notes: check-in and check-out were very fast and the staff members we encountered throughout our stay were extremely friendly.

Getting to the hotel from Narita: Don't take a taxi - it will cost a fortune. There's the Friendly Limousine Bus you can arrange at the airport. It's plenty comfortable and they store your luggage, but it took us just over 2 hours on a Friday at around 6pm (got to the Hilton shortly after 8). In retrospect, I wish we had taken the subway, although I was so tired from the flight. But that would have saved us at least 30 minutes, maybe more.

Overall, I'd absolutely recommend this Hilton. It really was an excellent base for exploring Tokyo during our 5-day stay.",4,2013/11/02

The staff was amazing. Everyone we dealt with went out of their way to be helpful.

The gym was small but nice. The sauna was great but I should note it had a Japanese style shower that took some getting used to (open room, sitting on stools).

Even though Shinjuku Station is close (10 min walk), the hotel had a convenient shuttle bus that ran 3 times/hour. This was nice since it frequently rained.

Plenty of restaurants in the area. It was also close to the Tokyo Metropolitan Building, which offered free tours in English (all you had to pay for was the metro ticket for the guide).",5,2013/11/02

And they had the most comfortable bed and fluffiest towels. Breakfast was good with wide selections. But it appeared that the breakfast room was not big enough and those who were not early birds had to wait in line for breakfast.

The fact that airport bus stopped at the hotel was good. However, I did not find the location convenient. For us, there was not much sightseeing to do in Shinjuku. So next time, we will probably try to do better research and stay closer to the sights we want to visit.",3,2013/10/26

Then we went into our room and behold, we had a view of the tent city. The rooms were nice and cozy and clean. My husband would advise that if you are not used to a group bath in Japan, that this hotel is mostly full of Japanese so they have no issues with sitting butt check to butt cheek in a group hot tub. He as the only westerner, so he did the polite wait 5 minutes and leave, but he much preferred the option of a private bath to rent.

1,REDACTED,en,2399,"Overall a mediocre stay again at this hotel. In fact the only reason I chose it was due to the Diamond benefits I thought I would receive. 

Typically as a Diamond member, I consistently receive the following (even at Conrad Tokyo):

1. Upgrade - didn't happen
2. Welcome letter from HM - didn't happen
3. VIP welcome gift - chocolates or fruit basket - nothing in my room
4. Complimentary pressing of 2 items of clothing - nope...

I did receive complimentary breakfast and Lounge benefits but to be honest - it was so crowded and so understaffed I didn't bother going back for cocktails and canapés after the first night.

On top of this I had to change my room as all I could hear on the first night was 'ton ton ton' from the ceiling keeping me awake. The new room was an interconnecting room and every morning at 5.30am I was woken up by the noisy businessman in the phone next door - thin walls, thin roofs...

Hotel is great.Reception is very competent,checkin very quick if you are HHonores member.
Room was excellent.We booked an executive room in an upper floor.We had room 3427 in the 34th floor.First night we ordered food by room service.Meal was excellent.All over all we had one of our best stays in an hotel worldwide.

1,REDACTED,en,2408,"We ended our trip to Japan by checking into the Hilton Tokyo for 2 nights. We were so glad that we did, the bed was perfect and so comfortable. Upon arrival, our bags were taken up to our room for us and we were upgraded to one of the newly renovated rooms which was a welcome surprise. We arrived at the same time as a big group of American businessmen. The shower was lovely, toilet typical Japanese standard, the carpet in the bedroom felt lovely to walk on especially after all the walking in Tokyo! Free tea and coffee facilities plus a bottle of water each, mini bar available. Two huge melting pillows which were much appreciated! Great view of the Tokyo high rise buildings! A typhoon was on its way to Tokyo and the staff were very informative. Buffet breakfast good with lots of Western food such as pancakes, eggs, cheese, cereals or you can opt for the Japanese staples such as miso soup and rice cakes. Free shuttle bus provided which left every 20 mins from the entrance and took you to the Shinjuku shopping area - excellent. For 3000 Yen you could opt for the bus to take you to the airport, we opted for this as the train would have been a nightmare with our luggage and a taxi would have cost 4 times as much! Free Wi-Fi available in the lobby and chargeable in your room, free internet PCs to use in the business lounge. All in all, a perfect stay that we could not fault and the concierge was especially helpful.",5,2013/10/18
1,REDACTED,en,2409,"We stayed for four nights in October. We got a room at the 29 floor with a really nice view on Shinjuku. The room was big, bed was great (good mattress), restrooms were a little bit old but functional and clean.
Breakfast was excellent with a huge buffet and all what you need to make a good start to visit Tokyo!

The location of the hotel is really good, you can access the Marunouchi Line (station Nishishinjuku) via the underground pass (e.g. perfect in case of rain). You can also take a 5-10 minutes walk directly to Shinjuku if you prefer.

Staff was friendly and the concierge was helpful. Keep in mind that its a very busy hotel so there is a lot of people coming in/out. This could lead to some queuing up and waiting.

There is still a few things we have noted the following:
- There is no complementary water in the room
- There is no internet connectivity in the room unless you paid for it! Free wifi or business center is available in the lobby
- We did order some food from the room service but they call us back three times saying that what we have ordered is not available (e.g. and we are talking about pasta and pizza not some fancy french cuisine)…but in the end we got some pretty good dishes.

Overall a very good experience and very good value for money (e.g. especially when you book this hotel via some discount website)",4,2013/10/16
1,REDACTED,en,2410,"I stayed in this hotel for 6 nights this past Sept 25-Oct 1 2013. Here are my good and not so good points:
Good: 
1.Beautiful large room for Japan. I was on the 18th floor with a pleasant view in one of the renovated rooms. A friend and I traveled together so the space helped a lot with our month long travel items.
2. Concierge service was excellent. I must give a shout out to Yuhsuke Nakamura for all the work he did to help us including tickets and directions to the Tokyo Symphony a couple days before the concert. His help was above excellent standards, even though the desk was very busy with lots of requests, he remained friendly and helpful. 
3. The swimming pool/exercise area is stellar. Also, the ""onsen"" facilities in the locker room was an added bonus. Everything was very clean and well stocked with whatever you needed.
4. Breakfast: The open buffet style included everything you may want to eat from Western to all Asian styles. It was well displayed and stocked with fresh food including eggs made for you and several types of smoothies.
5. Business center has good desktop computers to use for free. See below.

Not So Good: 
1. I am a Hilton Honors member, but could not find the room I needed on the hilton website. I went to a 3rd party to reserve my room since Hilton reservations said I could still get my points. Now I am being denied by the honors program. Beware if you want points to not believe the reservation people with Hilton. The were not nice in my denial.
2. Breakfast: It was a wonderful meal, but the downside was having to wait in line to get a table. After 3 days, they finally opened another dining room and that helped. However, then if I ordered a latte from the coffee bar, it took so long, my food was long eaten by the time it arrived. I like to drink coffee with my meal.
3. This is a very busy hotel. Lots of people coming and going all day. 
4. No internet in the room unless you paid $16 a day. The lobby connection was spotty and slow with so many people. I discovered the business center and they do have desktop computers for free. Be sure to use one that has an English sign on the bottom edge of the monitor. The Japanese ones do not work for English. This worked well as it was not too busy.
5. Our trip from the airport via the $30 bus was gruelling. Unfortunately, we arrived after 12 hours on the plane and hit stalled traffic at 7pm. It took us 2+ hours to get to the hotel. It is all the way across the city from Narita.",4,2013/10/14
1,REDACTED,en,2411,"My first meeting with the Hilton Tokyo was the shuttle bus at Narita. After travelling for 12 hours, it took no time locating the shuttle bus. A short stop at Shinjuku station followed by a short stop at another hotel before ending up at the Hilton.

The check in went smooth and all the staff spoke good English. The room was spacious. 

The location is so-so. Yes, you're in Shinjuku, but there's nothing of interest in the immediate area. They do offer a free shuttle bus to Shinjuku station, but just take the 10-15 minute walk instead. 

The only drawback was that you have to pay for Wi-Fi access. In 2013 this shouldn't be an issue, but for the Hilton (and this is worldwide) is seems they want to get just some extra $$ from your pocket. A shame really.",5,2013/10/14
1,REDACTED,en,2412,"Very convenient if you want to stay in the Shinjuku area, as the airport bus from Narita connects it. A small shopping mall and Japanese & Indian restaurants ( not part ofbthe hotel) at the basement level is added attraction. 
The executive lounge is also an excellent one serving plenty of snacks and drinks in the evening, but I wish it were bigger. 
The hotel breakfast area also needs to be renovated.",4,2013/10/14
1,REDACTED,en,2413,"Tokyo Hilton accommodations, location, staff are wonderful. I have been a guest at the hotel three times and will definitely select Tokyo Hilton whenever I go to Tokyo. You would not go wrong selecting Tokyo Hilton...it upholds the reputation of Hilton Hotels.",5,2013/10/14
1,REDACTED,en,2414,"Having stayed in several of the newer Hilton properties in UK, US and Asia, the Tokyo Hilton, itself already a legend, has been renovated to reflect the modern minimalist design that had become the trademark of the newer Hiltons.
The lobby is indeed busy, but ushers prompt you to the next available staff. Rooms in the executive floor are large and well-appointed with free wifi and free light meals at various times during the day at the Executive Lounge on the 37th floor, with a stupendous view of Tokyo. The staff in the lounge are extremely pleasant and converse well in English, with a peculiar American accent.
Access to the main train stations is aided by a free shuttle to Shinjuku or a basement walkway to the subway which can connect you on to the other stations.
Will stay here again for sure.",5,2013/10/14

The bathrooms were alright, the bed was very comfortable, the view was amazing and the staff were very friendly and spoke English very well. The breakfast was amazing with a traditional Japanese section and a more Western type of breakfast. The hotel is within walking distance of many shops and a nice park across the way that was very well lit even in the early AM hours.",5,2013/10/11
1,REDACTED,en,2416,"Staying here right now. Clean, up-to-date, well cared for. I have only two issues to keep it from a higher rating. First, though they advertise that you can watch streaming video on their internet, I have been unable to -- it keeps pausing, making it un-watchable. Second (and this isn't something they can probably avoid), but their executive lounge is always very crowded. Can't really move in it without bumping into someone. That's probably more of an east-vs-west comfort with personal space.",4,2013/10/11
1,REDACTED,en,2417,"When I travel outside the US at an American chain hotel, I expect the service to be on par if not better than in my home country. While traveling to Tokyo for work, it was hard to feel like anything more than a number at this hotel given it's massive size and the throngs of people passing through daily. 

Getting There
The most convenient way is to take a shuttle bus directly to the hotel from the airport (with the hotel name written in Japanese). However, since I arrived late at night they could only take me to Shinjuku station, which is a fairly confusing and lengthy walk with luggage in the humid summers. Taxis are way too expensive, so if you do get dropped off near the train station, make sure you have clear instructions in Japanese and English or can get the shuttle bus from the train station. The surrounding location has a Starbucks relatively close as well as other shops and restaurants, but you will have to look for them within other buildings without super clear signage for those not fluent in Japanese. Luckily, this location was very close to my company's Tokyo office, so taking a taxi proved to be the easiest. 

Common Spaces
The lobby has recently been redone according to the hotel. Upon arrival, I was told that my room type wasn't available in non-smoking, so I was put in a room with two twin beds. However, once my key did not appear to work the first time, the staff did personally escort me to my room to make sure it worked the 2nd time. 

The areas throughout the hotel all appear clean, but the lobby during the day feels a bit like a zoo with lots of different people including business men, tourists groups and other travelers. The concierge desk right by the door was fairly helpful with finding nearby places to eat and even making reservations. The taxi stand outside also works very efficiently though it's critical to have your destination in Japanese. 

The breakfast buffet is around $25 USD if it's not included in your room. The Japanese breakfast items and European style pastries are all top notch. The rice dishes and dumplings were worth a 2nd visit daily. The more Western hot breakfast items can be hit or miss depending on the day. 

The restaurants one floor up from the lobby are very expensive but overall very good. This is where I felt the service exceeded my expectations. Everywhere else felt liek the service was courteous, but due to the size of the hotel, it is virtually impossible to feel any sort of personalized touch here. 

Room
Other than my key not working the first time, which was a minor inconvenience, the room was well appointed. Daily housekeeping service did a good job. Noise levels were fine though in the mornings yelling children would often awaken me. 

There wasn't much of a view from the room other than of some tennis courts and other nondescript buidlings. The tea and kettle in the room worked well and the bathroom was updated an modern. It took a little guesswork to figure out how to use the remote for the TV since it was all in Japanese. 

The elevators were usually speedy but almost always packed with people no matter what hour of the day. 

Overall
I felt this hotel met my expectations but rarely exceeded them. Given the higher cost and distance from Shinjuku station, I would recommend staying in another part of town if you want to feel like you have a chance to soak in the local culture and be closer to other major tourist attractions, even if you're only trying to see them during down time from your work duties.",3,2013/10/11
1,REDACTED,en,2418,"I stayed at the Hilton Tokyo in September 2013 for four nights. It was perfect for a holiday in Tokyo. Location is convenient and close to shops, restaurants and only about 7 minutes walk from Shinjuku station which connects to many JR and subway lines. It's a very short walk from the hotel to Yoyogi park and the Meiji shrine which is great if you arrive early before check in and need something to do for an hour or two. 
The Hotel itself is superb. Rooms are large for Japan and the beds were long enough (I'm 6 foot). Clean, modern and the staff are professional and eager to assist. All that we encountered spoke English perfectly. The Concierge managed to effortlessly arrange a Michelin Star restaurant booking for two at very short notice. 
Sign up for a package that includes the breakfast buffet - it is extensive and delicious and if you're sightseeing, load up and you won't need lunch. Highly recommended. After visiting Kyoto I returned for a final night and stayed at the Palace near Tokyo Station - it was luxury for sure, but for value and location, it was not a patch on the Hilton.",5,2013/10/11
1,REDACTED,en,2419,"This is not your typical Hilton Hotel!
The rooms are quite small, especially the bathroom. And the bathroom is a very old design. I have stayed a few times at this Hilton in the last few years and twice I have had the toilet blocked with water pouring all over the bathroom floor. Not a pleasant experience.
At more than 30,000 Yen per night I would expect better standards, especially from a Hilton Hotel.
The restaurants in the hotel are very nice but very very expensive. I tried the Dynasty Chinese restaurant which has a nice selection of Yum Cha Dim Sum dishes though expect to pay more than $50 a head just for food.. I also tried Musahino Japanese Restarant and had there Sukiyaki which was delicious but at 13,500 Yen (almost A$150 per person) it is too expensive.",2,2013/10/09
1,REDACTED,en,2420,"The rooms are very nice, this is the good point, and the included breakfast buffet is exceptional. BUt the corridors, the bathrooms are very old. Also, we cannot beleive that at 300$ per night, they charge you for the internet in the room. In 2013, this is inacceptable for us. A last positive point is the free shuttle to shinjuku station, which is convinient.",3,2013/10/08
1,REDACTED,en,2421,"We stayed in this hotel for several days while we were in Tokyo. Great location. Check-in was slow, and as it turned out later our booked and confirmed king size bed room wasn't available, so the check-in person gave us queen size bed room (which actually looked like full size) without even letting us know. We dropped our luggage and went sightseeing. When we came back we realized that this is no way king size bed, so we went to the lounge to check if there have been a mistake, and we were told king size not available for this night, but they can put us to the junior suite for two other days with king size bed, and the room was huge comparing to the regular size rooms. The bed though, wasn't king size, but more of queen size. Our suite was by the elevator, so we had trouble falling asleep because it was pretty noisy with guests talking by the elevator after 11pm. The breakfast was good, so as happy hour in the evening. The housekeeping was very good, and concierge was helpful. Airport Limousine was on time and convenient. We also used shuttle to Shinjuku station several times, which was also on time.",4,2013/10/08
1,REDACTED,en,2422,"My grandkids and I spent five days here. We took the Airport Limousine bus from Narita directly to the hotel. This cost about $30 per adult and $15 per child. The bus was extremely convenient with the ticketing desk directly next to the baggage claim and the pick up point literally right outside the door. We considered the Skyliner train but that would have involved two transfers on a rail system we were not yet familiar with. So we opted for door to door bus service. It took about two hours but the buses were comfortable coaches with air conditioning so it was not really a big deal.

The hotel is a very busy Hilton. There was a line at check-in (we arrived about 1PM) but the service at the front desk was friendly and efficient and we were in our rooms in about 15-20 minutes. The rooms were very nice. Spacious, very clean. They have the cool high tech toilets also. Very nice. Don't be afraid to try it. Your rear end deserves a vacation, too.

The hotel is well situated being within an easy walk to the massive Shinjuku train station. They also have a shuttle to the station. From there, you can easily get anywhere once you figure out the somewhat complicated train system. We went everywhere by train. It was cheap and efficient. But there are many lines from different companies, so if you are confused, ask the concierge. They are a great help. You'll figure it out after a ride or two. From Shinjuku its a very short 15 minute ride to the great shopping and dining area of Shibuya. If you want to go to the more pricey Ginza district its about 30 minutes or so with a train transfer. 

We stayed in a room that had Executive Level access. I highly recommend this if you can especially if you are traveling with a family. It is great to have a place to gather and relax after a long day of sightseeing. Particularly in the summer. When we were there, the outside temperature was in the neighborhood of 105°F. Sweltering. The executive lounge staff was excellent and the lounge provides breakfast each day along with appetizers and drinks in the evening. There are also complementary DVDs that you can take back to your room. This was great for the kids evening wind down.

The only thing I didn't care for was the dress code for the Executive Lounge. I have stayed in Hiltons all over the world and I have never experience one with a dress code. Shorts were not allowed. This was made very clear to me (in a friendly way but nevertheless very explicitly) when I first visited the lounge (I was wearing shorts). In addition to the ""No Shorts"" rule, there are additional rules that are provided in writing. The really strange one is ""No Visible Tattoos"". I have since learned that until the post-World War II period, tattoos were illegal in Japan and are still considered somewhat taboo. I don't have tattoos so the rule didn't affect me but it just seemed strange at the time. The good news is that the dress code rule seems to be routinely ignored by visitors to the lounge and I never observed anyone being asked to leave because they were wearing shorts. I never saw anyone in the lounge with visible tattoos. We tried to be the good visitors and always change into long pants before visiting the lounge, but it was really a pain.

The restaurants in the hotel were quite good although expensive. There are also many off-premises dining options very near the hotel including some very nice Ramen shops for a relatively inexpensive but tasty meal. Please don't equate Japanese Ramen with the add boiling water into a styrofoam cup version you often find in the US. It's an entirely different experience. The hotel also has a pharmacy right in the lobby which was great when my grandson suddenly got sick to his stomach. The clerk at the pharmacy did not speak very good English (an exception for the hotel) but had a convenient chart of the human body with symptoms. All I had to do was point and she provided me with some kind of interesting pills that I had never seen before. They did the trick, though, and my grandson felt great the next day.

So all in all a very nice hotel. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again.",5,2013/10/08
1,REDACTED,en,2423,"My wife and I visited for a weekend getaway. We had a Hilton reward stay and elected to try the Hilton Shinjuku. The hotel is maintained meticulously and has convenient, relatively inexpensive parking. The executive lounge is very nice. We ate one meal at ""Checkers."" It was terrific, if a bit expensive. The hotel is located within walking distance of Shinjuku station and Central Park. Definitely recommend this hotel for people spending a few days in the city who want to enjoy themselves in western style accommodations with superb Japanese service.",5,2013/10/08
1,REDACTED,en,2424,"Easy access from the Airport as it is on the drop off route for the Airport Bus. 10 minute walk to Shinjuku station and the hotel runs a shuttle. It is also a pick up point for JTB tours. The rooms were of a reasonable size for a major city and decorated with paper shades to enhance the Japanese decor. Every person we had contact with from the check in, concierge and restaurant staff were eager to please and very helpful. It is close to Starbucks and a small supermarket where you can get snacks, fresh fruit etc.which is helpful for a family. The hotel was able to accommodate adjoining rooms which was wonderful. We are exceptionally fussy with cleanliness and upkeep of hotel rooms and we could not find one thing to complain about. Food and drink is quite expensive $26 for a basic glass of wine is a little much, even for a hotel of this level. Overall, I would definitely stay here again. A great location and wonderful place to stay whilst in Tokyo.",5,2013/10/08
1,REDACTED,en,2425,"Stayed at the Tokyo Hilton for three nights. Loved the smell as you enter the lobby. Quite a busy hotel but service was excellent. The rooms were bigger than other japanese hotels. Very utilitarian rooms with minimal fuss which i liked. Carpets could be changed...there was an 80s vibe to it. Toiletries were ok but nothing special. Sound proofing could be improved. I could hear the guest upstairs walking to the bathroom or moving his luggage.
The bathroom was tiny and while clean, had a musky smell. Breakfast buffet was regular and did not have the variety that one needs when one breakfasts at the hotel everyday. Location wise it was ideal. Near enough Shibuya with free hotel shuttle and with its own subway stop. Service was excellent with the staff attending to your every need. There is free Wifi at the hotel lobby too. It was a good stay. It feels more like a business hotel than a luxury hotel.",4,2013/10/07

When we got there, they didn't have a room ready and we had to come back around midday.

Other than that, everything was great. Would recommend to anyone staying in Shinjuku.",4,2013/10/07

The room is spacious in jap standard and their conceirge desk is super helpful. They arranged to book tables for me and advise me the best way to get to those restaurants.

The shower and the bed in the room are comfy. The only complaint I have is the lack of complimentary bottles of water - would really like to see this improved to save the hassle.",4,2013/10/06
1,REDACTED,en,2429,"THE ROOM
We stayed on the executive floor funded by Amex points. The room is pretty spacious by tokyo standards. Great bed. Bathroom is interesting - a short but deep bath and a shower are in a separate compartment separated from the toilet - all very high spec. Weird set up with a rolling blind outside the bathroom which covers the shower! The view was good, pointing towards Shinjuku station, but not spectacular being of some city streets. 

BREAKFAST 
Very good selection of Western and Japanese cuisine. Eggs cooked to order a highlight - really top quality. You can get better breakfasts for the money they charge, but definitely not one that you'd turn down if included in the room price. 

THE FACILITIES
Redone to a very high standard internally, the outside areas (and less importantly the facade) feel very dated. 

LOCATION
This area of Shinjuku is very business/govt oriented so not much other than the Shinjuku shopping area around the station within walking distance. However, the station is only a 5 min walk and you can get everywhere within 30mins on the JR line (even by the bay) and most places you would want to go within 15 mins. We also stayed at the Conrad near Shimbashi which very isolated in comparison.

1,REDACTED,en,2430,"I organised a surprise visit to Tokyo for my wife’s birthday, staying at the Tokyo Hilton. On arrival we were greeted by the Chief Concierge and Guest Relations Manager and made to feel very welcome. Also, all members of staff we encountered wished my wife a happy birthday – which after 15 hours of travel was delightful.

The room was newly refurbished and each day it was spotless. In general we were very pleased with the room – see other posts for room reviews…

We took advantage of our jet-lag and had breakfast each day at 0630. This helped to avoid queues for breakfast, which tended to form around 0730. There was a good selection of food (from healthy to not-so-healthy), which was always well presented and topped-up, although on some days could have been warmer. Breakfast-time was ideal for internet-related tasks as internet-access is free around the lobby. 

Staying at the hotel gives easy access to the Nishi Shinjuku underground station on the Marunouchi Line, although just as easy is getting the every-20-minutes shuttle bus to Shinjuku station (Keio store, #21), from 0800 onwards. 

On my wife’s birthday, we organised a private room in the Musashino Japanese Restaurant in the hotel. We sat at a low table and were served in a traditional manner by a young lady dressed as a geisha. The whole experience was fantastic: the food, sake, service, and décor were just perfect, and the hotel surprised us with a small birthday cake. 

To management: if you have a staff reward scheme I would wholeheartedly recommend the young lady that served us – she was helpful, efficient and very friendly.

So, I’m a big fan of the Tokyo Hilton: it looks terrific on the inside, and its location is great, but the people employed by the hotel made our time in Tokyo unforgettable.",5,2013/10/06

If any manager reads this please convey thanks to him, and also to Mr Ogura the front office manager for his ever-ready smiles and great service, and great recommendations, including our Teppanyaki lunch at the hotel restaurant.
Perfect stay and I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Tokyo !",5,2013/10/03

Its close to shinjuku shopping, golden gai bars and its easy to get around tokyo from shinjuku station which is really close. The staff were all very pleasant and the concierge helped us with ease. Amazing service for a fantastic price cant wait to finish our honeymoon here after our trip round japan.",5,2013/10/03
1,REDACTED,en,2435,"I stayed here twice for business. As a hilton member, i was upgraded to rooms on the executive floors with access to their lounge. The location is around a 15 minute walk to the Shinjuku Station and Hilton even offers a free shuttle to the station every 15-20 minutes, which is a plus when it is raining. The breakfast buffet had alot of selection and it is pretty good in Hilton standards. The gym was small but had enough treadmills, elliptical and weight machines for my daily workout. I didnt try out the pool but it looked very small. Overall, I had a great stay and service was splendid. Thank you Hilton!",4,2013/10/03
1,REDACTED,en,2436,"I wasn't expecting too much but the executive lounge access and the whole experience here was excellent. The lounge had great breakfast, really liked the fresh donuts. Evening drinks. Felt like home away from home. I booked early so the rates were excellent and the location to subway was very convenient.",5,2013/10/03
1,REDACTED,en,2437,"Stayed here for four nights and it was the best four nights of our stay in Tokyo. Perfect location, walking distance to Shinjiku station/shops/restaurants and clubs (although there is a courtesy bus every 10-15 mins to the station). Hotel staff speak English, are knowledgeable about the surrounds and go out of their way to assist guests. Breakfast buffet is amazing - western, Japanese, European and Asian styles. Rooms are quiet (we were on the 17th floor) and our non-smoking room had no smell whatsoever. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013/10/03
1,REDACTED,en,2438,"I stayed there from the 21st of September to the 28th 2013 and all I can say is wow. Firstly when we got there we got told that they had upgraded up to the deluxe suite which was an amazing room with a beautiful view of the city. The room and bathroom were actually quite spacious for a japan room. The break fast at the hotel was to die for and had every breakfast item you could think of and more from an egg station where they make you eggs any way you like, pastry section, fresh fruit, cereal section and much much more. 
The concierge at the hotel were also very helpful. Every time we needed help going somewhere or booking something they would go out of thier way to help us and make our trip alot easier. 
The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from shinjuku station but there is a shuttle bus to and from shinjuku station every 20 mins which made life alot easier after a day of shopping. I also read people complaining about the hotel having to wait to elevators and let me just say that I was on the 16th floor and never had to wait longer than 30 seconds for any of the elevators in the hotel. All in all I can honestly say this is the best hotel I have ever stayed at and would highly recommended it to anyone planning on staying in shinjuku.

1,REDACTED,en,2439,"I recently stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and would definately recommend it to English speaking travelers. The staff all spoke English and were extremely friendly, polite and helpful in assisting with tours, airport transfers etc. The hotel has a free shuttle to Shinjuko Station, which stops in front of the Keio department store. This is extremely convenient as many day tours end at Shinjuko Station and this is an area full of stores and restaurants.",4,2013/09/30
1,REDACTED,en,2440,"This was a typical Hilton, everything you would expect. Manager Kentaro Ohira left a note in our room introducing himself, which was quite nice. Lovely staff, eager to help. We were upgraded to the Executive Level which is always nice, HOWEVER, there is a 'dress code' which they remind you must be adhered to!!!! The hotel is centrally located, walking distance to Shinjuki train station (they have a free shuttle). I would definitely reccommend it.",5,2013/09/30
1,REDACTED,en,2441,"I have stayed at this hotel three times in the past three years. It is very well run, excellent service, stylish, clean, and in a good location. Although it's not cheap, it really is an excellent value. It's like staying in a luxury hotel at mid-range prices. 

The renovated rooms are tastefully decorated and impeccable. Even the un-renovated rooms (I think there are still a few left, but not many) are clean and not shabby. Beds and linens are comfortable and new. Bathrooms have a large tub, dual shower, washlet (of course), and good amenities. Rooms on the higher floors have a great view of the Shinjuku skyscraper district.

Service is top-notch. Everybody is pleasant and helpful, and speak English well. If you have any problems or questions, they will help you immediately. I had a couple of minor issues during my last two stays, and the staff was very quick to resolve them, exceeding my expectations for good service. It is obviously a point of pride with them to satisfy the guests.

The hotel is an easy walk to Shinjuku JR station, and even easier walk to the local subway station. They have a free shuttle bus to Shinjuku station, and they can arrange limousine bus service to either airport. 

I did not try any of the extra services, due to the high prices. I did receive complimentary breakfast at the buffet. The food was good, but not worth the 3600 yen cost of admission. I would not use it had it not been free. All of the restaurants are expensive; there's a cost to use the fitness center; high cost (1650/day) to use wifi in the rooms (although wifi in the lobby is free). I think that if they were to include at least one reasonably priced dining option, as well as free wifi in the rooms (which really should be standard at all hotels in 2013), then this would be a perfect five star experience for me.

Overall I recommend this hotel and would stay there again if I return to Tokyo.",4,2013/09/29
1,REDACTED,en,2442,"What a fabulous hotel, in fact this is the nicest place we have ever stayed, and within stumbling distance of the bright lights and golden gai area.

Can't wait to stay again for a couple of nights at the end of our holiday.",5,2013/09/29

Hotel very clean and very nice pool,gym and bathing area. if you arrive early you can have a japanese bath at the gym and freshen up, then head to the lounge for some delicious food before check-in. shuttle bus service is great and gets you to Shinjuku station. Shinjuku is a very busy station and district and great for roaming around and exploring.",4,2013/09/27
1,REDACTED,en,2444,"I stayed here for one night on a layover. I got an upgrade upon request, but unfortunately it was on a smoking floor. The exec lounge was closing so I didn't get to use it. The room is clean and is of decent size with a nice view; also the bed is very comfortable. Based on hotel staff's recommendation, I took breakfast in the lobby instead of the exec lounge, and I was not disappointed! I then took their free shuttle bus to do some shopping. Upon return, I was pressed for time to catch the airport bus, so I just went down to the lobby thinking I could do a speed check out, but I still had to wait in line. The queue was kind of long and I started to worry that I might miss the bus. A staff assured me that they would hold the bus for me (what a gal!) Overall it was an excellent stay. I do hope there is a quicker way to check out without going to the exec lounge or the lobby.",5,2013/09/27
1,REDACTED,en,2445,"For a westerner in Tokyo on business wants easy access to good food, a comfortable bed, and a good shower. Everything else is a plus.

I will list instead of dragging on endlessly.

TV: Good quality HD but a lack of western channels (FYI...CNN International is not considered a western channel)
Air Conditioning: Excellent
Bed Quality: Not your bed but not a bed of nails with rock filled pillows. Pretty good.
Iron in Room: Pathetic. Cordless Hitachi brand VEGEE - Horrible idea
Dry Cleaning: Fast and Efficient
Wifi: Very good
Lighting: Eh - OK - The lack of incandescent lighting gives everything a cold look
1st Floor Restaurant: Decent breakfast WAY overpriced

Prior to check in we requested a renovated room. The room is quite spacious and very clean.
Service was good and front desk is very helpful and accommodating. There is a free shuttle service from the hotel to the train station. But we find it quicker to just walk then to wait for the shuttle bus. It took us about 15-20 mins. We will definitely stay here again.",5,2013/09/25
1,REDACTED,en,2448,"I've been staying at the HIlton in Tokyo for years (since 2007), and still one of my favorite hotels in the world. Great location, staff is always helpful, and room are nice (although I was told by the exec lounge staff I should try the new refurbished rooms next time). If you have access to the exec lounge, it is still one of the best, evening cocktails are absolutely great, but over crowded with too many people having access. Breakfast at the lounge still one of the best, and downstairs which I haven't had in a while, was really good as I remembered it.

Now, the penny pinching. I forgot they have ice machines at the end of hall so I called for ice, and was charged a service fee. They also charged to store luggage as well. For a 5 star hotel, which I considered it to be, I would expect this to be part of the service.

Regardless, still would stay here as I love the location and the Hilton points do go a long way. And I've been coming here enough times some of the people do recognize me, which always makes me feel welcomed.",4,2013/09/25
1,REDACTED,en,2449,"Hotel is excellent. Very clean, friendly helpful staff-gave us perfect directions to everywhere.

1,REDACTED,en,2451,"I have never written a review before and we dont normally stay in places like the Hilton but this stay was part of a special offer and a treat and it was amazing! We (2 teenagers, my husband and I) stayed in an Executive Suite for 4 nights in July. The suite was really spacious, with 2 sleeping areas, great amenities and a sitting room /desk area. The staff were incredibly helpful with any queries. 

What really made it great were the perks of the Executive floor rooms - you get free breakfast either in the executive lounge or in the lobby (where they have so much choice - smoothie station, eggs cooked to order, hot food, huge continental choice, fresh fruit galore, Japanese options...), you can help yourself to drinks throughout the day in the executive lounge and in the evening you get free alcoholic drinks between 6-8pm with canapes too. There was a really friendly and sociable atmosphere there between the guests and staff.It meant that in those first few jetlagged evenings, we werent confined to our room.

There is a free and very regular shuttle to Shinjuku train station (approx 15 min. walk), swimming pool and gym are small but great. We even left our spare luggage for a week for free. The airport shuttle bus goes straight to the hotel which was also great after a long flight. 

It is in the business part of Shinjuku and has quite a different feel to the shopping (east) side but this is still very closeby.",5,2013/09/23
1,REDACTED,en,2452,"When you take a ""bucket list"" trip to Japan for your 40th you want to do it right. Five stars to the Hilton. Initially we hit a snag since we had received an upgrade notice prior to arriving and once we got there we were informed by the front desk that was not going to be the case. Obviously this made for an immediate misfire in meeting our expectations. After spending a few minutes in the basic King which as some reviews have stated was in need of an overhaul we called for the night manager since we had a confirmation of a junior suite prior to arrival. Tanaka came through for us and moved us to the suite. We also received amenities to include a green tea cake that they sell in the lobby and free daily breakfast at the Marble Lounge. Breakfast was outstanding everyday. Nice bar area at St. Georges and good workout facility. Great free shuttle bus if you need it and convenient access to the subway. Thanks for the great stay.",5,2013/09/23

Having a gold HHonors status, I decided to try Hilton Tokyo as I've always been getting a great service and upgrades from Hilton's around the world. 
This time I was disappointed as I was given a worn-out room where especially bathroom is very tired. Also upgrade was not given which was the first time since a reached gold status on 2010. 
Honestly, I wish I'd have read more reviews about the rooms before I booked as for this money I'm spending I would expect more in a city like Tokyo...",3,2013/09/21

It's in the middle of the business district and it's quiet at night. We're early risers, so the location worked very well for us. If nightlife is important, you'll want to stay closer to the station where there's more activity.

There is a good selection of reasonable restaurants next door (Shinjuku I-Land) that cater to the workers on there way home.",5,2013/09/19
1,REDACTED,en,2455,"High standard hotel, business oriented, not so much for the tourist. Bus from the airport stops in front of the door, excellent breakfast buffet,good service, cetrally located but still quite a walk is needed to go to a lively area. Bar closes early.",4,2013/09/18

1,REDACTED,en,2457,We stayed here on the last leg of our honeymoon. The hotel was outdated and the rooms felt very tired. The hotel was not worth the cost. The only plus was the location.

1,REDACTED,en,2458,It's my first time visit Tokyo but not Hilton properties. Location is good and very close to Shijuku area. They are complimentary Hotel Shuttle bus to Shinjuku station however you also can just walk there ... less than 10 minutes walk. I am Hilton HHonors Gold member but too bad they could not upgrade me to Executive Floor however overall experience is great and will definately come back again.,5,2013/09/15
1,REDACTED,en,2459,"This was my 4th trip to Japan in the last decade so I do have some basic understanding of the business culture as well as the social differences among our western approach and the Japanese. I can also do a pretty good comparison of the A-Class establishments in Tokyo since I have stayed in the Best of the Best Japan has to offer, so what I am about to write about Hilton Tokyo, Shinjuku, is as accurate as it can be.

This was my first stay at the Hilton Tokyo and I stayed there from 09/04 - 09/08 , I arrived late on a flight from Chicago, I arrived to the hotel at around 23:00, upon check-in I was offered a discounted upgrade of my room, I was already in the executive status, but I took it anyways. Aside from the upgrade offer, everything was explained to me in detail, and I am talking about in detail, I got all the information about Breakfast and the Executive Lounge. In addition to that my return travel arrangements were made at the same time, so before I even checked in completely they had me setup for my departure. This is PRICELESS. Let me just say that any worries about the transportation back to the airport where already taken care of and I could not be happier. (Actually, I could I just did not know it yet... read further).

The rooms are quite big by any standards with the bedroom and office/living room separated. They are newly renovated from top to bottom, and the second you open the door and walk in, you can smell the freshness and cleanliness of your suite, both rooms are independent controlled for Heat and AC, which was great because I like it super cold at night, and work in a warmer room. I was very tired so I took a shower in a perfectly designed and organized bathroom and went to sleep. The next morning, I knew I had a busy schedule and I had to travel some distances from Tokyo, specifically I had to go to Yokohama which is not a walking distance. I started with the Breakfast at the Marble Lounge ... you will be AMAZED!!! what type of Breakfast is served, you name it they have it, including eggs to order any style, but I chose to go a little more far east and try some of the things that I had no clue how to pronounce, absolutely delicious and unlimited.

The next I went back to my room it was then, that I noticed how everything was 100% perfect, I took pictures of all room and sent to my wife to judge. 10 out of 10. I had to go to Yokohama so I got dressed and went down to the lobby where I had my first contact with the Concierge. 100% on top of things, they got me where I need to be ON TIME !!! This is something quite important in Japan. I returned about 8 hours later in a taxi, again greeted by the Staff outside the Hotel on the inside, back up to my room to refresh and then back down to the Marble Lounge where I informed them of my meeting later in the evening with my business clients from Kyoto (also pretty far from Tokyo). The staff at the lounge again was super helpful and allowed me to choose a table in the corner away from the main area or the lobby. The table was held for me when I arrived back with my guests it all went super smooth, having some drinks and light meal. Them being Japanese were also quite impressed with the Hilton . The next day, another trip to another location again quite far so here I go to the Concierge. 10 out of 10 services they put me in a taxi at my request and I get to my meetings and handled my business. I came back to the hotel later that day, went to the Executive Lounge to sit in quiet and go over some business proposals. Staff at the Executive Lounge is top notch!!! Being so satisfied with the services provided I decided that on all of my future trips to Japan, Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku is the only choice, let me just tell you from the experience of a world traveler, skip the others and stay at the Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku, you will not be disappointed. 

The list of the accolades is 10 pages long, if I was to write everything I would bore you to death, from the lowest level to the highest Executive in the Hilton Chain of Command they are 10 out of 10. I think I have said enough and I will leave it at that. I see there is some nasty reviews here, I just think some of these people have expected the freebies and because they did not get them they are just disgruntled. 

Now for those of you traveling to Japan for the first time: business or pleasure here is one advise…learn some basic Japanese, it will take you further than you think, as people in Japan are very traditional and I have found the Japanese to be extremely organized, polite and respectful, everybody is super nice, everybody bows and the list goes on. They are 100% devoted and concentrated on the current task, from the moment they wake up they are so involved and dedicated and they are giving 110% to everything that they are doing. A culture is so difficult to understand to foreigners that I did not even try, in a country where people never say no and hardly mean what they say, the art of interpretation is the key to success in Japan.

1,REDACTED,en,2461,"I had stayed in Hilton Tokyo for 3 nights from Aug 9 to 12, 2013 when I was on my vacation in Tokyo. I got very bad impression during my stay. I had waited the elevators for 20 mins . I got in the 5th elevator as 4 of them earlier were full of guests. I wish I could use a stair but i stayed on 19th floor. I totally understand that they were crowded in the morning but this is clearly NOT 5-stars standard. The concierge was so rude to me. It seemed like he didn't want to answer my question about a bus to the airport. I asked then he just gave me one quick answer and got back to do his things on computor. He even didn't tell
me that I needed to make a reservation for the bus until I was skeptical and asked again. I felt like i talked to someone who just didn't want to help. Excutive lounge representative asked me to leave because I wore a sandal to have breakfast there. For god sake, I came for vacation not for business. I didn't realize that I had to dress up to get my breakfast. I understand rule is rule which doesn't make sense sometimes. If I had been allowed to get in, I would have to wait for few minutes as they didn't have space available for me anyway. 

Please don't stay at Hilton Tokyo. All i can say that It is NOT worth your money at all.",1,2013/09/13
1,REDACTED,en,2462,"This was a great hotel. I was upgraded for minimal cost from a standard room to a deluxe executive which came with access to the executive lounge and wifi in the room (note all other rooms do not have wifi. You have to congregate in the lobby like smokers huddling in the cold for a smoke). The signal was very strong. 

The room they put me in was newly renovated. so very clean and modern with a view of the rooftop tennis court. oddly enough, one of the bathroom walls was made out of glass and you could see into the bathroom. That was a bit too sexy for me. But they there is a sliding wall thingy that you can pull over the glass wall. 

The bed was very comfortable, the sheets were cleaned and spotless every time I returned from a day of sight seeing. 

the only issue I have with this hotel is that when taking the elevator down to the lobby it stopped at every floor, every time. It was kind of crazy!!

The in room massage service was a welcomed option after a loon day at Tokyo Disney Sea.

The buffet breakfast is fantastic. Something for everyone. I really liked the freshly made fruit juices and smoothies. 

Oddly enough one of the best meals I had in the hotel was a hamburger topped with egg and a ton of other ingredients. It was easly the best burger i have ever had. It was made medium rare and was made from grounded sirlion steak. just melted in your mouth. 

The location of the hotel is fantastic. Just a short 10 minute walk from Shinjuku station, Kabuki Cho and all of the lights and energy of tokyo. 

What really impressed me with this hotel was the fact that they let me leave my bags for 1 week while I toured Okinawa, even though I was not returning to the hotel upon my return to tokyo. Very impressive. This will certainly be my go to hotel when I return to Tokyo next month and thereafter. 

The service by the staff was very good. Lots of security. Everyone I dealt with spoke english and there were no issues with communication.",4,2013/09/13

It is an enormously busy hotel. The staff are helpful, yet talking to the concierge in the lobby was challenging due to the noise level. 

The decor of our suite felt like a step back in time. Graphic patterns on the carpet and the lingering smell of days past when the room must have been a smoking room. 

At the end of a long travel day, we were grateful to come into an air conditioned hotel, and have a drink with a set of jazz in the lobby bar.",4,2013/09/12

All booked in advance & great seats at the gigs to boot! The hotel worked hard upon arrival to accommodate me in the room type of my choice & I was upgraded to the Executive floor - it was immaculate & very comfortable. Internet was fast & complimentary (as an HHonors Gold) & the executive lounge offered high quality breakfast & evening snacks complete with alcohol.

1,REDACTED,en,2473,"Our family of four including two small boys had a great stay here for a few nights earlier this year. We had a shock at check-in when we discovered that we would be charged an extortionate rate to have a roll-away bed in the room, but after some discussion we came to a more palatable deal.

We stayed in a King Tower Executive Suite. One of our boys slept on the large sofa in the living room and the other on the roll-away bed. There was still lots of space for all our luggage, including ski gear. The staff were very helpful and attentive, especially with setting up the room for the boys sleeping arrangements.

We arrived at night and opened our blinds in the morning to a fantastic view of Mount Fuji. Fantastic.

Breakfast was fantastic, in a nice atmosphere in the lobby. It really set us up for the day.

The concierge was very helpful, especially with arranging for our luggage to be sent by courier up to Nagano, meaning that we could travel lightly on the shinkansen.

The hotel is located about 5 minutes from the nearest train station, and about 15 minutes walk (with small boys) to Shinjuku Station which is huge.

This is the hotel we spent 12 days in, it is a beautiful hotel, the employees are very ice and professional. The rates aren't bad either. The restaurants have great food, a little pricie, $28 for a hambuger (it's been a few years), great breakfast buffet. Would not mind visiting there again, if ever back in Tokyo, thatis where I would most likely stay!",5,2013/09/03
1,REDACTED,en,2475,"We stayed at the Tokyo Hilton in Shinjuku for a few nights in June and were rewarded with excellent service from the the front desk, the concierge (extremely helpful!) , the restaurant, and bell desk staff. We had a nice junior suite on a high floor with a view of the Shinjuku high rise area which was very spacious for the three of us (myself, wife, and teenage son), and had very comfortable beds. Although we paid extra for the breakfast buffet and WiFi package it was well worth it (you can get free WiFI in the lobby area). The buffet was very good with plentiful food options from a number of cuisines. The hotel location was within walking distance of the Shinjuku train station and had an underground connection to the local subway station which made it very convenient for getting around Tokyo. There were many restaurants close by to try out different cuisines including Italian, Indian, Thai, Chinese, and of course Japanese. We enjoyed our stay very much and compliment the hotel management and staff for making our stay in Tokyo a very pleasant experience. We would recommend this hotel for a pleasant and convenient stay while visiting Tokyo.",5,2013/09/03

Location wasn't brilliant but the Airport bus did take you straight there.

1,REDACTED,en,2484,"This property has all the advantages of a classic hilton...which means English speaking staff, standardized food, and American style recognition of membership status. Staff is very polite and helpful. However, I was really disappointed by my two stays. The first one, because my room had not been renovated yet - so I had a 20 years old bathroom! I thought of it as a bad joke. The second time, because I realized some other shortcomings like the sound isolation. This time my room was ""renovated"" (i.e a little layer of white paint in the bathroom) but the building is so old that whatever they do to renovate, the sound issue will never be solved. You can hear footsteps from above, toilet flushing from besides, voice vibrations from below...and sometimes even the super annoying ambiance music from the corridor (elevator style music is for elevator use only!). It seems Hilton took over a former Hyatt property, and is just making money out of the minimum investment. Sorry, I won't be back: I've discovered the newly opened grandiose Palace Hotel.",2,2013/08/28
1,REDACTED,en,2485,"My overall rating is based on what a five star international business hotel would be and cost/value ratio. The location of the Tokyo Hilton is great for a tourist. It is convenient to get to by using the airport limousine shuttle bus that drops off right at the hotel. You have the Tokyo Metropolitan Towers almost next door. The Shinjuku gardens, about a 20-minute walk, are one of the best in Japan. It is easy to get around Tokyo using the subway connected to the hotel or by walking or taking the shuttle to Shinjuku Station.

The concierge/luggage carriers (the line seems blurred at the hotel) were excellent and very friendly and helpful and spoke excellent English. The receptionists were professional and quick as well.

But now the bad. The hotel is WAY too crowded without the infrastructure to handle the crowds. Most of the lobby area is taken by the restaurant, so there are not many places to sit. If you are waiting for a tour in the morning, most likely you will have to stand. I know space is at a premium in Tokyo, but five star lobbies should have couches, chairs, end tables, etc. Also, while I was there, guests had to wait forever for elevators, and then when you finally got on, they were jammed packed like the Tokyo subway in rush hour, very uncomfortable. It seemed that at least two out of the eight elevators in the lobby were out of order. If the hotel knows that it does not have the infrastructure to run at full capacity, it should cap its room capacity at 75% until it can handle the crowds instead of selling out the whole hotel. Payiing $300+ a night, then having to wait forever for elevators is not right. Also, breakfast is ridiculously expensive at 3400 yen per person.

I stayed in a junior suite. The bed was very comfortable, but some of the decor needs updating. For example, there is not a single picture on the wall, and the leather couch was scratched up and uncomfortable. Others things in the room were nicer, such as the Japanese style shutters on the large windows, the nice clock, the long desk, etc. The bathroom is very small and disappointing, with the basic format you expect from an average motel, with the sink on the left, the toilet in the middle, and the bathtub on the right, though the amenities were nice. The walls of the bathroom were were plastic and wallpapered, not at all luxurious.

As a tourist in Japan, I liked staying in Shinjuku, but I might choose another hotel, one that doesn't cater so much to huge convention parties and one with better infrastructure. The staff, though, at the Tokyo Hilton is top-notch.",3,2013/08/26

Excellent breakfast - varied selection of hot and cold foods and sweet pastries to go with your morning coffee. Loved my Coffee Latte every morning. European style breads, tasty rolls and pastries. Fresh fruits, vegies, cheese, anything your heart desires. Easy to get to via Limo Bus from Narita Airport. Tickets can be purchased at airport - buss right outside - drops you of at hotel's entrance. Two hour ride apx. Upon return purchase tickets to Narita Airport from hotel.

",4,2013/08/23
1,REDACTED,en,2490,"Having stayed at ten Hiltons in nine countries over a five month period, I was very disappointed by this Hilton. 

The good - the staff was friendly and the lobby is nice and typical of the Hilton standard. There are also a lot of choices for meals with several different restaurants on site. The breakfast buffet in the main lobby restaurant has a great selection. There is also a bus service to/from the airport which is very convenient.

The okay - the location is decent considering you can walk to the train station and metro stations quite easily. The hotel is in the middle of a business district so if you are in Tokyo for holiday then the location is not ideal.

The bad - first the rooms. I had upgraded to a King Jr. Suite as this was my last stop on a six month travel journey and I wanted to splurge. However, the room was completely outdated (note they are doing renovations although I did not see any renovations and do not know the status). The biggest problem with the room was not the outdated style and small bathroom but rather the noise from the guest above me. I heard the guest literally all night long. Granted a guest should be able to do whatever they want in their room and stay up all night but I should not have to hear them. After talking to the front desk staff the next morning, they did move me to a new room. Believe it or not, the room was actually more outdated and in worse shape. And the worst part was that I again, heard the guest above me for the remainder of my stay as well as people next to me (I could actually hear/feel someone snoring in the room next to me). This was very disappointing considering the money I spent on the room.

The other problem I had was with my reservation. I booked an advanced pay room and two days before arrival got an email that my credit card wasn't working and I needed to respond. I did giving them my new expiration date on the card (my Honors profile has my Hilton credit card number which had expired). After several emails back and forth they told me that the card still wasn't working and they were reverting me to the normal price which was over $100 more a night. I wrote back again explaining one more time and never heard a response. When I arrived I explained the situation and the front desk person went to ask the reservations manager. Without the long boring details, I spent a very long time at the desk going back and forth with them telling me my credit card wouldn't work so I was going to have to pay the full price (mind you I had been using the credit card across the world at various other Hilton properties for six months and paying the balance every two weeks). I finally asked the front desk person to see if she could run the credit card. She did and it worked which finally proved that the error was on the side of the reservations staff. So that was finally resolved after a lot of time and discussions.

Although I will continue to stay at Hilton properties in other countries, I will not return to the Hilton Tokyo. There are too many other choices that I am sure would make for a better stay.",2,2013/08/19

1,REDACTED,en,2492,"We'stayed at the Hilton Tokyo for 3 nights as before going on a cruise starting from Yokohama. Right from the beginning we felt comfortable at this place. The check-in-procedure was very smooth and the staff very efficient, so that we could go to our room already at 11 a.m. 
Our room on the 36th floor (king jr suite executive) was very spacious, comfortable and guaranteed us very quiet nights in this fantastic city. We enjoyed breakfast at the executive lounge on 37th floor - the selection was not huge but nevertheless delicious. The staff at the lounge was extremeley attentive, so our days couldn't have a better start.
We found the location of the hotel to be perfect for our needs - within a short walk you can reach several underground stations, restaurants, shops, ...
Finally we can say returning to Tokyo means returning to this great hotel! We can definitively recommend it.",5,2013/08/19
1,REDACTED,en,2493,"The hotel is connected to an underground retail area & tunnel which leads to a minor metro stop, 1 stop away from the main Shinjuku train station. You can also get to the main Shinjuku station via the hotel's free bus shuttle. Walking would take 10-15 minutes. Ideally, we had wanted to stay in Shibuya but at the time we booked, every hotel listed in the top 15 on Tripadvisor was fully booked. However, because of its location and the many department stores, Shinjuku ended up being a very convenient district to stay in. A supermarket was conveniently located just 2 blocks away - great for drinks & even sushi (fresher than the sushi that we've had at suburban restaurants in the USA).

As for the hotel, the staff was wonderful - they spoke excellent English, were very welcoming and friendly. The concierge desk was OUTSTANDING. Except for 1 tour, we had opted to plan out our sightseeing on our own. The concierge gave us all the info we needed to have a terrific time in Asakusa & Shibuya/Harajuku, Meiji shrine.

Our suite was huge - much larger than suites we've had in NYC where each square foot costs a premium. And the view was spectacular! My only complaint & why I gave only 4 instead of 5 for the rating was the size of the bathroom - very tiny/cramped & nothing special. Wish they had taken a few square feet away from the extra large bedroom or ridiculously large living room area to add to the bathroom.",4,2013/08/19

The hotel is a 20 min walk from Shinjuku station, although there is free shuttle bus. I found this moderately inconvenient but on balance worth it for the good room size. If you like walking out of the hotel and being in the centre of the action then bear this in mind.

Okay…they were supposedly full but were able to move us to a lower floor with no access to Executive lounge. The rooms we were given were far apart and I had to constantly check on my kids in the other room. Both rooms were nice and we liked the view. The shuttle was a nice touch and staff were pleasant but we were disappointed with the carelessness with which our reservations were handled. We also visited Bali and Bangkok after leaving Tokyo.

1,REDACTED,en,2501,"Full Disclosure: I am a Platinum Starwood member that has an ""allergy"" to Hilton hotels. I have managed to stay away from Hilton for many years but just checked out from a very nice week at the Hilton Tokyo hotel due to a colleague insisting that we stay ""at this property"" while in town. 

It was nice. Not over the moon great but nice. 

First what I liked: The hotel smells good. I did not think that I would ever write those words in a sentence but my goodness it is true at this property. I think that they are pumping out some sort of ""happy smell stuff"" out on the curb and in the lobby. Anyways, it was the last of my 5 senses that I expected to be engaged at a hotel property and it was a pleasant surprise.

The room itself was really nice. 2917. Pizza pie shaped room with one 1.5 meter by 1.5 meter window at the narrow end that featured both black out shutters and japanese paper doors. Modern , almost minimalist, design feel to the space. Tan carpet. Bed was firm, pillows were soft (* too soft) and the TV was large. Felt ""opulent"". They offered me lounge access , on the 37th floor, and it was splendid. Nice breakfast with a marvellous coffee machine that ground the beans for your coffee and then made the beverage post haste. We also had cocktails on the 37th floor lounge one night from 6 pm and watched the sun set out the window. Very nice. Overall the lounge is worth the executive room fee that they are charging for this service. 

What I didn't like: There was a sound , like an alarm clock in another room ( but it wasn't) that was present in the room 24/7. It woke me up, but I had settled into the room by this time so I didn't call and request to change rooms. Earplugs from the plane were called to duty. I told the guy at check out about it, so hopefully they fix it. 

The bathroom. It was circa 1985 and was in dire need of a re-fresh. Cream coloured tile and a glass door that guaranteed a flood of the bathroom after each use. 

The elevators: each use of the elevators was a planned event, and included comedy as a bonus. The hotel is apparently updating the elevators at this property to meet new local building codes and they are only running a few of the 6 elevators that they have at once. Every time I tried to use the elevators I either A) was greeted with an elevator that was already full of guests or B) it took a month and a day for an elevator to come. This construction / improvement is apparently scheduled to end in August of 2013. Plan ahead. 

Overall: I would, and probably will, be back to this hotel ( September 2013?) 

My rating: 1-10: 8.5

They have 2 tennis courts also.....",4,2013/08/09

The room rates are reasonable for a hotel of this calibre in this neighbourhood of Tokyo, but they aren't by any means a great deal. To put it in perspective, the Imperial was about $80/night cheaper on my stay, but being a business trip, I needed the location.

The food, unfortunately, while respectable, is certainly not deserving of its stratospheric pricing. I have eaten in multiple Michelin starred restaurants in Tokyo and Kyoto and they seemed like bargains compared to Musashino and Dynasty in the hotel.

The service is also respectable, but by Japanese standards, nothing special.",4,2013/08/09
1,REDACTED,en,2503,"Duration of Stay - 6 nights
Room Type - King Executive
Purpose - Business

My fourth stay at the Hilton Tokyo. First time in the King Executive. Check in is usually busy on the ground floor; however, with an executive room booking the hotel will register you on the 37th floor (executive lounge). Check in was efficient. Staff were friendly. Was given a room on the 36th floor; hence, it was quite convenient as I was able to access the executive lounge using the designated stairs (located by the lifts).

The room:
Contemporary, neat and today. King size bed was comfortable. Great glass top desk with much improved internet connection (the Hilton was undergoing some internet connection upgrades when I stayed in, I believe, 2011 - much better now). Bathroom is not spacious; however, is clean and has great amenities. Enjoyed using the Gatsby shaving gel... quite soothing. The housekeeping staff are generous and will replenish your amenities daily (that's if you use them). Above all else, as I was on the 36th floor, I had a wonderful view of Shinjuku. Quite impressive at night.

Executive Lounge:
As I was busy at work or attending client dinners, I rarely visited the executive lounge BUT the few times I had breakfast, I enjoyed thoroughly. Great selection of carbohydrates (i.e. pastries, toast), dairy, Japanese food, Western food, etc. Suggest sitting by the window - wonderful view of Tokyo... that's if it's not raining.

Restaurant:
Rarely eat at the hotel restaurants in Tokyo (born and raised so I know all the good and cheap places) BUT I do enjoy their Chinese (Dynasty Restaurant... I believe). Not cheap but good food. As for the other restaurants... sorry, can't comment as I have never tried. 

Other benefits:
Free bus service to Shinjuku Station. Runs every 20 minutes and drops you off at the station. Runs on time and can save you some money. 

Location:
Very convenient. Family Mart and 7-Eleven (convenience stores) close by. Several restaurants within walking distance. Tokyo Metro station entrance located on the ground floor.

What disappointed me:
As the Hilton Tokyo was undergoing lift refurbishment work during my stay... the wait was quite long. Minor issue but was quite annoying when I was in the rush. 

Overall, no complaints. Would be staying again in October/November 2013.",5,2013/08/08

The airport limo service is great. I highly recommended using this service. You can buy the tickets at the airport on the first floor. For your return, you have to reserve with the front desk for your tickets. 

The shuttle bus to Shinjuku station is also a plus. The shuttle service starts at 9am to 10 pm (?) and it schedule for every 20 minutes. It takes about 10' walk or 710yen ($7.10) taxi. 

There is a Family Mart and 7 Eleven within 5' walk from the hotel. You could get snacks, food, ATM, etc. They open late. We walked there almost every night for ice cream and snacks. My kids love it. There are also restaurants, both Westerners and Japanese, in the basement of the building next door. 

Upgrade to executive floor if possible. Free breakfast and happy hour. 

The room is big for Tokyo. We did not get the newly renovated room but our room still very new and clean. The bed is comfy and linens are at Hilton's standard. Staffs are very friendly and all of them speak English very well.

It was a solid experience in every regard. During my stay, the Hilton Tokyo rose to the occasion and showed me its absolute best of customer relations when dealing with an unfortunate misunderstanding that had occurred. The person who made the mistake first called me to take responsibility and to apologize. Overnight, the head of room service (which is the division that made the error) had a letter written to me and put under my door taking full responsibility and apologizing. It appear that half of the hotel staff and much of senior management, led by Helene Jacoby, spent the next day and a half on the lookout for me (I left for work before 7 a.m. and did not return until 9 p.m.) in order to apologize. When Helene finally hunted me down the following morning, she explained to me the scope of the ""manhunt"" they had been doing for me, and then she personally took full responsibility and apologized and offered to do whatever I wanted to ""make it right"". Silly me, I should have asked for a free night or an upgrade to the Presidential Suite. Instead, I settled for her apology and five dollars to reimburse the actual cost of the food for my special kosher diet that room service had destroyed and that I had no way to replace. But I still came out of this experience a happy guest, because the Hilton Tokyo showed that they really cared about my issues and my concerns and were not going to rest until they addressed them. Their attitude made lemonade out of the lemon and made me a customer who intends to come back to them on my next trip to Tokyo",4,2013/07/31
1,REDACTED,en,2510,"The hotel is in a great location to explore Tokyo, particularly as a first time visitor to the city. We found it easy to get from Narita airport using limousine bus, which went straight to the hotel - and the concierge helped us with the reservation for the return bus. The hotel is also directly connected to NishiShinjuku metro station, from the main lobby, which is on one of the main lines and so connects easily with all parts of Tokyo. The hotel itself has undergone a major refurbishment project -which must be almost complete as we did not experience any noise/disruption. The overhaul of the final 2 of 6 lifts was nearing completion - however, we did not have any unduly long waits. We booked an executive room, which was very spacious, modern and well appointed.- the beds were so comfortable. This also gave us access to the executive lounge, which served extremely good complimentary breakfasts with plenty of variety, afternoon tea and cocktail hour. The hospitality was very generous - they didn't leave us with an empty glass. The staff were lovely and very helpful",5,2013/07/31
1,REDACTED,en,2511,"This hotel has a very good location. It´s just 4 blocks from the Shinjuku Station. Concerning the hotel inside, is nothing more of what you expect from a pure Hilton. It´s big and the people there is very nice and helpfull. Rooms are not big but comfortables. It´s a good option folks!",4,2013/07/31
1,REDACTED,en,2512,"We traveled as a family (spouse + 2 young kids) to Tokyo for the first time so this was a great place to explore Japan as a base camp. Our room was a suite with a king bed in a separate room. We had a very good view on a high floor; the room was incredibly spacious to accommodate one rollaway bed and our other child slept on the sofa (very wide and comfortable). A few highlights for us: 1. Proximity to a local market, Maruetsu is a supermarket opened 24/7 and has everything needed for late night sushi to the diversity of drinks; 2. Concierge, Mr. Shimano, was incredibly helpful and articulate to navigate us thru the complexity of Japan metro and get us to our destinations; 3. Walk or shuttle to Shinjuku train station (we did both); 4. Bus shuttle, VERY affordable, to take us directly to Haneda airport (or Narita). I loved the suite setup; bathroom could be bigger, but a minor issue; more plus plus and very comfortable bedding. 

Potential considerations: the live concierge desk is very knowledgeable, however calling the reception desk from the US seemed like a totally different experience like they didn't totally understand you (maybe just an off day). Don't be misled, the hotel caters to the international customer and our English was well understood face to face. Also, may want to provide better instructions of how to get from Narita airport to the hotel (including a diagram of Shinjuku station and exact location of the Hilton shuttle stop). However, son't sweat the small stuff about the elevator, this is a non issue. We waste the extra 30 seconds standing in front of a metro map trying to figure out where we're going! Enjoy your stay, we did.",5,2013/07/30

This is one of the few rare times when we all look forward returning back to Hilton Tokyo. The manager greeted us when we checked in, belllady delivered the luggage to our room promptly. We had no problems with the elevators, there was never long waiting time. Service was impeccable -- front desk, concierge, breakfast.

I also was involved in a conference there for 3 days and we stayed for another 3 days after the conference.

1,REDACTED,en,2516,"Arrived on the 'Airport limousine' bus from NRT which stops right at the hotel. As most Japanese hotels are, we weren't able to check in until 2pm as hotel states. This is common in Japan. The hotel is very large and very busy, but cool with the humid outdoor temperature of 35! We had lunch nearby at one of the numerous underground malls in Shinjuku. We were able to check in at 1.30pm at our deluxe king on the 36th floor. A spacious room with a great view! Nice bathroom, towels, products. The bed and pillows were the best of our entire 2 week trip, so comfortable! Comp bottled water was a nice touch. Exec room was included in our rate with afternoon tea, cocktails, and breakfast. We arrived 1/2 hour before afternoon tea was due to finish to find mostly everything put away. I didn't make the same mistake with cocktails. The lounge was very busy and we were seated by the staff. When seated our drinks order was taken, and from then our glasses were never empty. A nice range of canapés, hot and cold, with amazing views of Shinjuku and Tokyo. We took breakfast in the main restaurant because because we assumed the variety may be more than in the exec lounge. Although very busy, we were seated in a quiet area. The breakfast variety was vast, very enjoyable. After checkout we were greeted by the front office manager in the lobby who greeted me by name. Very impressive service. I noticed the front office manager really working the room and chatting leisurely with the customers!",5,2013/07/28

Bed comfortable and bathroom good, for a standard room I was very pleased with everything. Shuttle bus service to shinjuku is so useful. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013/07/28
1,REDACTED,en,2518,"Agree with other reviewers. Good hotel, relatively near shinjuku train station, but I wouldn't say ""walking distance"" especially when it is >90 degrees! More like 4 long city blocks. Use the hotel bus (which can get really crowded at times) so beware. you can go underground in subway system but it is still pretty far and directions are confusing. If you arrive by train, it is confusing how to get to the hotel, so either find out where the bus stops (west end of station; hard to find) or take a taxi. I'd suggest the hotel bus from the airport, but you'd have to find it.
Hotel itself is standard Hilton, that is, quite good. didn't get the exec rooms (very crowded our week, no non smoking rooms). Wifi is free to gold and above members. agree buffet is pretty good (though expensive), has juice bar, fairly extensive western food. eastern food surprisingly limited but ok.
Has a free pretty extensive 24h gym with weights, many machines, which is nice when jet lagged. Pool is small but nice, indoor. has modern Japanese bath (with cold tub) in same area (free). sometimes crowded after 5p. nice for relaxing (remember to completely bathe first as per Japanese custom). agree the staff are extremely responsive. found no problem using wifi in the lobby, although it is small and crowded. 2 elevators still out which is annoying during peak AM/PM hours.",4,2013/07/28

Also on my last day, my flight was really early in the morning so normally I couldn't have breakfast, but they arranged a quick one just before I left. About the breakfast I want to mention that it was one of the best I've ever had with lot's of vegan options. Overall it was a really good choice.",5,2013/07/28
1,REDACTED,en,2520,"We stayed two adults and baby approx one week, and thought it was really nice.
Thd king tower suite was large, clean and with a gourgeus view.
Staff was friendly and helpful.
Would absolutely consider staying here again.",5,2013/07/27
1,REDACTED,en,2521,"My initial impression on check in was they were trying to up sell their suites. We had 2 executive rooms booked and arrived early in the morning. We were told I could have the suite straight away if I did an immediate upgrade of one of the rooms. When I declined, I was further offered a better rate if I did. When I declined again, he gave up and kindly offered my room by 11am instead of the expected 2pm. We had just been travelling the last 24hrs from Melbourne and were slightly exhausted so that was appreciated. I was also beginning to feel rather unwell, more of that later, so they held our luggage and we did a bit of walking to the Shinjuku station and orientation to our whereabouts.
That evening my husband was more than a little annoyed when told he was not suitably dressed for the executive lounge because he had on a pair of white leather sneakers. He was attired in long sleeved shirt, long pants and just happened to have on a pair of very clean sneakers (leather) as we were on holiday and were planning to do a lot of walking. Others in the lounge were in flip flops, grubby sport shoes from the gym and even in shorts but did not seem to be told they were improperly dressed.
The real test came however the next day when I fell seriously ill and needed to go to the doctor and then to hospital. They were very helpful in calling around for a suitable clinic and to arrange for a female staff member from concierge, Ms Hoshino, to accompany and translate for us the entire day. The next day I was still unwell and they again helped us to call around for an English speaking doctor who was available on a Saturday. Fortunately we found one who managed to assist us in Shinagawa. The Japanese health care system was foreign to us and we actually found it very difficult to get adequate medical assistance. Hilton did not seem to have an in house doctor who could see me and triage me accordingly. Even my travel insurers did not seem to have a list of recommended English speaking doctors. There did not seem to be any A&E I could go to either and the issue of language would then probably have been a major issue if there were.
In all it was a little bit of a disaster as I was in a lot of unnecessary pain due to the inability of the first 2 doctors who saw me to adequately manage my problem. It was only the 3rd doctor I saw on Saturday who finally acted more aggressively and managed to give me adequate pain relief. I speak as a medically trained person myself.
On other matters, the food in the executive lounge for breakfast and afternoon tea and evening canapes were good. The staff were always helpful in serving drinks and taking final orders before close of the bar. Due to my illness I did not have the opportunity to use the gym nor pool but it did look very inviting.
The free shuttle to and from Shinjuku station was very timely and efficient. 
Goto San, the manager of the executive lounge, even gave us some information on Kyoto for our onward journey after our 5 day stay.
We used the luggage forwarding service through the hotel to our next hotel in Kyoto and everything went smoothly with our luggage already waiting for us when we arrived in Kyoto the next day.",4,2013/07/26

1,REDACTED,en,2523,"I must admit that I have very mixed feelings about my latest stay at this hotel. I fully appreciate that this is a high quality property, but, in this case, the service that I received was below standard. 

First of all, the in-room WiFi did not work on ANY of my devices, and after I contacted the hotel I was directed to call the support centre myself. The call took about 40 minutes, and the general idea was that the problem was most likely to be inside the hotel, and they needed to reset the system a few times. Luckily for me the problem was resolved, and with best intentions in mind I informed the reception about the problem, and tried to provide them the support ticket number, so the hotel could resolve the problem for future guests. However, to my surprise, no one at the reception was interested, and they tried to explain that the IT system operates separately from the hotel.

The next morning, I awoke especially early to make up for the time I had lost the night before, and to my surprise, the WiFi did not work for me once again. I contacted the receptionist, and, to my second surprise of the morning, I was directed to the tech support line yet again. In the end, the fact that I had lost a lot of my own time fixing their internet did not phase or concern anyone at the hotel. 

In the end I demanded a new room, as, at this stage, I understood, from my conversations with the support line, that the problem was connected to the room itself. 

My third surprise for the morning was that in the new room, everything was working fine.
I find it hard to believe that the staff didn’t know about that the WiFi wasn’t working in some rooms, and do not appreciate the fact that absolutely no action was taken until I demanded a new room.

Later in the morning, after I arrived in my new room I found a welcome message on my table from the General Manager Jamie [---], unfortunately the message was not addressed to me but some other guest. I again contacted reception, and the lovely girl at the reception was confused and promised to look into the mix up, and to my next surprise, nothing happened over the rest of my three day stay.

This is my own experience, and is probably the product is a series of unfortunate events, however, a few more observations I had over my stay are similarly unpleasant. 

For instance, the staff at the executive lounge would routinely forget orders, the staff in the 1st floor bar would make some rather obvious mistakes in orders, and the most annoying problem was the elevator, which would take up to 15 minutes to just reach your floor. I have seen that in previous reviews, the management staff explained that the elevator will be in full service in a few weeks, but that makes no difference to me, as it affects my visit and the visit of many other guests, who have no intention to return in a few weeks. 

So, all in all, I understand that this is a high quality property, but it is let down by repeatedly low quality services, which does not correspond to the prices they are charging.",3,2013/07/25

I stayed in both a regular and superior room, both were great for amenities and the hotel is well designed so that it is quiet at night. Lovely toiletries too!!

Service is great in international standards (like staff actually smiles and looks sincere in trying to provide service to you), however we were very dissappointed by the elevators, it seems that only 2 out of 6 elevators are working and it has to take a stop on EVERY floor from 38/F to the bottom. The breakfast is also a bit chaotic and makes one wonder whether it has the ability to match the capacity. 
Otherwise a good business hotel for staying in Shinjuku area, note the walking distance from hotel to Shinkjuku JR station is about 20 mins.",3,2013/07/22

Agree with a previous reviewer. Lots of elevators, but only 2 seem to work, so there can be a wait. I've stayed here several times and don't remember it looking like this. Disappointed overall. Breakfast was just ok. Area smelled of cigarettes.",3,2013/07/22

1,REDACTED,en,2529,"We enjoyed a wonderful stay at the Hilton in Tokyo recently. We had two rooms both with amazing views of the city, one could spend a fair amount of time just staring out of the window. The quality of the rooms was more than satisfactory. The breakfast buffet was wonderful and if one arrived early enough it was also peaceful. It does get very busy from 8am onwards, this however did not seem to impact the quality of the food or the service in any way. The location is in the business area of Shinjuku making it very quiet. On a number of occasions we walked to the subway station without encountering another person - quite unexpected. The hotel is serviced by two subway lines and a free shuttle is available to Shinjuku Station. We did not take advantage of all their facilities as we preferred to explore Tokyo from morning till night but all the standard major hotel chain facilities are available. The service, as one expects from Tokyo, is excellent. In particular, the concierge service was outstanding. We challenged the concierge service with many unreasonable requests, such as a reservation at Sukiyabashi Jiro, where tables are booked out at least a month in advance. Much to our surprise and delight, the concierge delivered. Our many other requests, while not quite as unreasonable as an immediate reservation at Jiro's, were nonetheless challenging and the staff delivered on every count. Thank you for making our stay memorable. Highly Recommended.",5,2013/07/20
1,REDACTED,en,2530,"The hotel was great they gave us adjoining rooms keeping a tab on the kids, tho we just sleep thru anything they were doing. I have no complaints about anything important. They didn't give us sugar for the coffee and the cream seemed old but the tea was great. The breakfast buffet was 2300yen which was the same price as the hotel in Osaka so we prepaid and the selection was overwhelming. I came back with a pot belly mostly of breads and other you shouldn't eat stuff. I usually leave whole bunch of food on my plate and go for seconds but I cleaned off all my plates before I went back for more. The area is quiet and a little away from the fun area, They have a shuttle to Shinjuku station 12 32 52 mins. after the hour. If you want to buy snacks you have to cross the street to Marriott and in the basement they have a 7-11 and family mart. 7-11 is better stocked. The attention is great tho I felt that they hid their smirk well. But if we can get the same rate $350 for two rooms 5 people I will go back and next time not take Narita Express but the Airport Shuttle since it stops at the Hotel. less hassle.",5,2013/07/19

You really could have dinner there every night and not eat out in Tokyo. Excellent choices of heavy hors d' oeuvres. The staff is very friendly, helpful and what I liked best polite! You can exchange US for Yen and vice versa at the front desk. Room service and hotel restaurant choices are very expensive and should be avoided. Great club sandwich, but $25.00 is too steep for a sandwich for this frequent traveller.

The bathroom was a little small and seemed to be old but I've been told that they are in process to renovating the bathrooms. The buffet breakfast and lunch at the Marble Lounge was pretty good, with a variety of western and Japanese style dishes. The room service was also nice, quick and efficient. Since the hotel is almost at a 10 minutes walk from Shinjuku Station they operate a pretty frequent shuttle, the airport limousine bus also comes to the hotel and taxis are always available even at 6am! Would definitely stay here again. Highly recommended.",5,2013/07/14
1,REDACTED,en,2536,"Landed at Haneda airport very late and got to the hotel close to midnight. Maybe it was late at night, no bellboys or concierge staff to help you with your luggage. Lobby was large and seemed nice and modern. Went up to the room and it was a decent size considering it is Tokyo. There was the flat screen tv, but unfortunately no shower stall, just the bathtub which I always consider to be a safety hazard. As i was on vacation with friends, I didn't hit the gym or the breakfast area, so I can't comment. Didn't try the restaurants either , as this is Tokyo after all, with 1,000 great dining options, unlike some cities or countries which shall remain nameless

Located in shinjuku, there is a shuttle bus that takes you to shinjuku station, which is like a city in itself. You'll need to do that, as there's nothing around the hotel. Visit the basement food halls in each department store at shinjuku station, they are like the one in Harrods' London, but on steroids . The concierge is pretty good with the local knowledge and service

As some reviewers mentioned, wifi is not free in the room. So unless you're a business traveller, you go to the lobby and compete for 1 of the 2 comfortable chairs in the lobby, if not there are 2 small leather benches. Getting seats for free wifi in the lobby, new competitive sport",4,2013/07/12

They have a shuttle bus to/from the Shinjuku station which comes in handy. Room was very nice and larger than expected and still allowed for room to move around in, after adding rollaway beds. Nice toiletries in the bathroom and good replenishment. The Japanese concierge staff was excellent and even helped do some research on some very specialized customized items I had made as well as gave us the usual sightseeing and transportation advice. 

On the other side of the ledger:
Lack of free wifi was a bit of a bummer. There is free wifi in the lobby and business center however, there is very limited seating in the lobby, aside from the restaurant only a few seats and a couple of benches. I was very surprised one day when sitting using the wifi on my tablet to be quite rudely asked to leave the lobby by a larger blond/greyish haired American? woman working for the hotel who said that these seats were only for elderly people who needed seats. She also asked some others to leave. I didn't see any elderly people waiting to sit so this all seemed rediculous to me as a paying guest. I've never been asked to leave a lobby before in all my travels. This person needs to learn basic customer service in how to treat guests and some tact.",4,2013/07/08

I had a reservation for a King Executive Room and as a Hilton Honors Gold member, was upgraded to a King Suite on the 37th floor. The suite was excellent - it had all the amenities we needed, including pajamas. The rooms were spotlessly clean and very comfortable. There was a knock on the door soon after I arrived and fruit and chocolate were brought in. A complimentary Hilton bear was perched on one of the nightstands. The food and the service in the Executive Lounge were so amazing that we visited several times. It felt strange to walk out without paying or tipping for such excellence. There were no problems with waiting for the elevators from the 37th floor. Check-in and checkout were fast and smooth.

1,REDACTED,en,2544,"One thing I found when searching for hotel accommodation in Japan is the additional (hidden) fees one may incur if one is not aware of such fees. For example additional hidden costs may be ""shower fee"", ""bath fee"", ""person tax per night"" and other miscellaneous taxes depending on where you stay. However at Hilton, as we booked directly from Hilton's website, every type of fee which could be one's nightmare was included in the price - which gave me the peace of mind.

Check-in was fine, not immediate however, even though there were 3-4 staff at the counter (and all were active and with guests) - a sign that the hotel has a high occupancy rate. As HH Gold, we were offered an upgrade to the exec floor - but a smoking room. We declined the upgrade, nevertheless, were offered free buffet breakfast at the restaurant. 

We were given a room on a very high floor which was very nice - overlooking the park and also to an office building some 500m away - and on that clear afternoon I could see as far as some 6-10 nautical miles. The view was definitely amazing for a city hotel if you get one of the rooms on the top-most floors. Room and toilet was very clean, bed extremely comfy and representative of other Hiltons. 

As HH Gold, there was no additional charge to use the hot bath or gym, or swimming pool. Note to fellow travellers: at other hotels we had to pay an additional charge to use these facilities even though these facilities were all within the same hotel. I must say this is where the value of HH comes in. 

Buffet breakfast was top-notch - definitely one of the highlights of our trip. From Japanese cuisine to crusty French croissants, from freshly blended fruit juice to made-to-order omelette -it is a breakfast heaven! 

Staff at the Hilton Tokyo spoke fluent English which was a big plus - unlike some other hotels we stayed at. However the staff at concierge gave us mixed feelings - where 1-2 staff were not sufficiently helpful (but merely pointed to information brochures) while the others were patient in explaining routes/tours, etc. 

Location was very good, but not perfect. Very good because it was located in the business district of the city; not perfect because it was some 7-10 minutes (off-peak) by shuttle bus to Shinjuku train station. That said, Hilton provided complimentary shuttle to-and-fro the bus pick-up point near Shinjuku train station. If you choose to walk, Hilton is probably a 30-minute stroll to Odakyu and Keio - the boutique shopping complexes (thereabouts) above Shinjuku train station.

All in all, Hilton Tokyo was an excellent base for travel around Tokyo, Shinjuku and even a few stations out of Shinjuku. If you are planning to visit Tokyo Disneyland and Disneysea, stay at Hilton Tokyo Bay instead of Hilton Tokyo and save the 1+ hour (one-way) public transport (plus complimentary shuttle) travel time. That said, if I were only visiting Tokyo and Shinjuku, Hilton Tokyo will be my first choice.",5,2013/07/04
1,REDACTED,en,2545,"Only a few of the elevators are in service so if you happen to be waiting with a large crowd to go up, you may need to prepare for a wait. Likewise, if you're going down, wait might be long, and on the downward trip, potentially stopping at each floor if you're leaving at rush hour.

Overall check in staff and lounge staff are excellent. Despite being in Shinjuku, actually it's a bit away from main station, although hotel does provide a free roundtrip shuttle.

Room are good, some are being remodeled on a rolling basis so you may get a newly remodeled or older room.",3,2013/07/03

1,REDACTED,en,2547,"As a frequent Hilton customer and Honors member I picked this hotel to stay at and found check in to be quick and easy with a friendly staff. My rate included internet, but required staff intervention to remove charge from bill (problematic of the Hilton chain in general which refuses to become mainstream with free wireless!!!). I used the concierge desk on two occasions and found that the staff was very helpful and supplied maps as well as suggestions. The room I had was pretty average for the Hilton chain and in need of a little updating (carpet a little worn, outdated wallpaper and tile in bathroom. Bed was quite comfortable. Hotel was quite full and the elevator situation was troubling at times with long waits for the cars. There were 2 cars down for service, but I am not sure that when all are operational there would be much of an improvement. Plenty of restaurants in the area, but get directions from concierge as they are in the various office/retail building in the area and are not allowed large signs. Easy walk to the Tokyo subway (Nishi-Shinjuku) (past the hospital) or catch the hotel shuttle to Shinjuku Station for other transport options.",4,2013/07/01
1,REDACTED,en,2548,"Almost everything about this hotel met my expectations of yet another lovely Hilton property. The room was clean, comfortable and well-maintained, with a very nice view (north, I think) in the evening, and free internet readily available in the business center. Where did it fall down? The elevator situation was dismal. I hope this was a temporary situation, but I had to wait more than 5 minutes for an elevator more than once during my 4-day stay and of course when it finally arrived it was absolutely packed. There is a shuttle service to and from Shinjuku train station. It was slow enough - and the hotel close enough to the station - that I chose to walk rather than wait for the shuttle. Breakfast was exorbitantly-priced by my standards (although in fairness to Hilton, priced similarly to other major hotels I stayed at in Japan). One short block away (I don't know the name of the street, but in the direction of Denny's and the park) is a very nice mini-mart - a big step up from a 7-11 - where you can purchase snacks, wine, sushi and breakfast food the night before to store in the room's mini-fridge. Bottom line, would definitely stay here again, hopeful that they'll have addressed the pitiful elevator situation.",4,2013/06/30
1,REDACTED,en,2549,"This is a very comfortable, nicely decorated and well run Hilton. The hotel is fully staffed and the staff is exceptionally helpful. Despite the obvious popularity of the hotel among both Japanese and international travelers, the staff never seem overwhelmed or shorthanded. The swimming pool, gym, and spa are more than adequate. We opted to add the daily brunch to our booking and we were happy we did. The hotel has a very well-stocked, expansive spread of Western and Japanese brunch choices with a trained and attentive staff. The concierge gave several recommendations for restaurants, including obscure noodle houses (which we asked for). Each time, we were impressed by their accurate understanding of what we were looking for. And the beds are exceptionally comfortable too.

Overall, we highly recommend this hotel for comfort seeking travelers,",5,2013/06/30
1,REDACTED,en,2550,"Excellent hotel perfectly located in the nearby of the city hall of Tokyo. Near the shinjuku station to connection to every other part of Tokyo.

1,REDACTED,en,2551,"We stayed twice at the Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku last week. The experience was superb and I would like to highly recommend this hotel. The rooms were beautiful and very spacious by Tokyo standards. The bathrooms were small unfortunately.
Being a Hilton diamond member gave us access to the Executive lounge which was one of the best club lounges I have ever come across. Breakfast there was outstanding, and the evening cocktails and canapes came with a cocktail barman who could make you anything you felt like having. The martinis and margaritas were very classy. We met the Executive lounge manager, Goto, as we were checking out. A very pleasant young man ideed.
Gymnasium and sauna / pool facilities were also outstanding.
I would certainly stay at this hotel again when I return to Tokyo.",5,2013/06/30
1,REDACTED,en,2552,"A good and convenient hotel:
With point-to-point limousine bus from Haneda airport to hotel. With free hotel shuttle bus running between Shinjuku station and hotel every 20 min. With a Hiltopia shopping arcade linking the hotel to Nishi-Shinjuku Metro station. The lobby is quite huge but very crowded at all times. Check-in process was quite fast. All staff have high level of English proficiency. Excellent service everywhere. 

Excellent room and lounge:
Offered two upgrade options as a Gold Hilton member (even the room is booked through third party agent) - either to executive room (renovated a few years ago) or to deluxe room (renovated in Spring 2013). Front-desk staff kindly offered us to have a look at both rooms before we chose our upgrade option. Even the older executive room is not so old, we picked the 35/F executive room because it’s on the much higher floor and offers executive lounge access. The lounge on 37/F is excellent, well-designed and spacious, with two iMac and comfortable sofa seats overlooking the nice Shinjuku areas. It serves great breakfast (changing slightly daily), great afternoon tea and mediocre evening canapés (of course lots of evening drinks) – really high quality food. 

Bathroom is a relatively small. Toiletries are excellent – Peter Thomas Roth! Slippers are quite bad though, thin like paper. Bed is great and comfortable, but not sure why I was awake 2-3 times each night during all the 4 nights. Sound-proof is good. Excellent view from room, overlooking the commercial buildings in Shinjuku. Very clean in every part of the room! 

Cannot think of improvement except for the several elevators which run from G/F to 38/F – perhaps the hotel is too busy, quite often I had to wait for 5 min+ to get in the elevator on 35/F, and another 5 min+ ride to get to G/F as it usually stopped 10 times+ before arriving G/F. Luckily we didn’t pick the Deluxe room on 14/F – I’m sure those on the lower floors will be much more frustrated by the elevators. But I am aware that 1-2 elevators were out of order, maybe the problem will be solved soon.

Highly recommended, will definitely come again.",5,2013/06/28
1,REDACTED,en,2553,"This Hilton Hotel is perfectly located in Shinjuku. The hotel has a friendly atmosphere and the rooms are spacious and recently renovated. The concierge is very helpful and the suggested dining options where great. You can start your day with a perfect breakfast from the buffet, it's diverse and fresh. To start your evening you have to visit the hotel bar, it's cosy with a good vibe. To explore Tokyo just hop on the metro under the hotel.",5,2013/06/25
1,REDACTED,en,2554,"We (4) stayed here in June for 2 nights. Large International style Hotel. Not cheap but good size rooms with stunning views. We did not book breakfast but because they messed up our booking we were offered breakfast in lieu. Our bathroom was a bit old fashioned but clean. Lifts can get a bit crowed because there are so many floors ( over 30). 
Breakfast was impressive. Restaurant on second floor was not cheap but the food was excellent.",4,2013/06/24
1,REDACTED,en,2555,"This is a typical large and soulless hotel in Shinjuku, however its location is excellent and of course the level of service is in accordance with the brand standards. Not much to criticize, the room is not very large and the bathroom even smaller but everything is rather new and the bed is good. Internet connection, as expected is shamefully expensive. Convenient, anonymous, efficient and probably not a too bad choice in the area.",4,2013/06/22
1,REDACTED,en,2556,"Stay at the Hilton was excellent. The service at the front desk was fantastic although the next day was not as great so it depends who you get. We were lucky enough to great an upgrade to an executive room on the 36 floor with great views of Tokyo. The room was very clean, the sheets were crisp and the pillows comfortable. Free tea and filter coffee and also an iron in the rooms.

Location was very good with a free shuttle bus to Shinjuku station only 5 minutes away with traffic but you can walk it in about 10. The buffet breakfast was the best we had in Tokyo with a wide variety of both hot and cold foods. The freshly made smoothies were delicious!

We took the airport limousine bus directly from the front of the hotel to Narita which was very convenient. Book at the front desk. We traveled on a Sunday and traffic was not to bad, took less than 1.5 hours.

We would definitely stay at the Hilton Tokyo again as it ticked all the boxes for a great stay.

1,REDACTED,en,2557,"What can I say, hotel and hotel staff are five star! We stayed with two kids and the room (executive suite) was more than enough to fit all four of us with room to spare. Admittedly, I did not interact with the staff on a regular basis during our stay, but for the times we did and from observing other guest interactions, they went out of their way to be helpful and accommodating. We did not eat at the hotel restaurants and can't comment on quality and service, it was more fun and cheaper to eat elsewhere. The free shuttle to Shinjuku station was real helpful, especially when it rained. I highly recommend taking the shuttle to the station and walking over to ""yakitori alley"" near the station and visit a couple of the places - truly Japanese experience. If you want to explore the city, the hotel is the perfect base - you are minutes away from all the sites, whether you need to go on the JR or Metro Line. Also, don't miss going to the Park Hyatt NY Bar for the view.",5,2013/06/21

1,REDACTED,en,2559,"I stayed in this hotel for twice in mid-June 2013. Both stays were upgraded to executive floor.

Both check in were fast. Special thanks to the concierge, which was very helpful for keeping my luggage between my stays. They were also resourceful when I asked them for directions to various attractions in Tokyo.

Rooms were great. Nothing to complain about except for one of my stays I found some pieces of hair in the bath tub.

Executive lounge is spacious. Choice of food in breakfast/evening was adequate. 

For location, it is in west part of Shinjuku. Not very convenient, but hotel offers shuttle bus running between hotel and JR Shinjuku west exit. Walking from Shinjuku Station to hotel takes around 12-15 min w/o luggage. A 3 min taxi ride costs 710 JPY. There are also 2 metro stations nearby, but still need a 10 min walk.

I'm satisfied for both stays and the service here is far better than the properties in Fukuoka/Osaka.",5,2013/06/20
1,REDACTED,en,2560,"For such a pretty hotel and a wonderful location, it is a pity that the service standard are not up to par. Whenever we're in Tokyo, we normally stay at the Hyatt in Shinjuku. This time we decided to stay at the Hilton and there were so many obvious differences in the quality of service, it was unbelievable. 

Right off the bat, we started on a bad note. 24 hours prior to arriving at the hotel, my husband called the hotel in Japan, not the 1-800 number, to verify our reservation. The Hilton rep could not find our reservation and after some time, they finally fixed it. (Foreshadowing???) They eventually confirmed our two, king sized, non-smoking rooms. 

After 8 hours plane travel from Hawaii and a 1.5 hr bus ride from Narita, we arrived at the hotel to be told that all they had available for us were smoking rooms. My daughter and I each have asthma. This would not do. Strike ONE. 

For more than 30 minutes, my husband tried to work with the front desk person to find a suitable room. The best they could scrounge up for us was two non-smoking rooms with twin beds. Meanwhile my oldest daughter was not feeling well and ended up falling asleep on one of the lobby benches as we waited. Finally, I stood up, walked over to the Front Desk and demanded the Front Desk remedy this problem. They screwed up our reservation twice now and why should we have to accept twin sized beds? I told her to fix the problem immediately even if she had to upgrade us to a suite. But to wait 30 minutes for a room was not acceptable. 

Finally, after I loudly confronted her, she found two rooms on the 20th floor where one room was ready and that we could have the second room in 45 minutes after they cleaned it. We agreed to this. They told us that they would send someone up with the key when the room was ready. It took a total of 50 minutes to finally get upstairs to a room. My question is why did it take 45 minutes to come up with a suitable solution and only after I had to raise my voice and demand for it? Since my daughter was feeling ill and sleeping on the lobby bench my patience had run thin. 

After 1.5 hours of waiting and waiting in the one ready room, we finally called downstairs for status on the second room. Well guess what? The room was ready and no one came up to bring us the key as promised. Strike TWO. 

Several hours later, we went to dinner and went back upstairs to our room. The key did not work. Sigh........... we had to go downstairs again to get the card re-keyed. Strike THREE!!! 

At this point, we were upset. When we went to get the card re-keyed, we asked to speak to a manager. We waited 10 minutes and finally the Shift Leader came to speak to us. He was polite and apologetic and told us that he would relay our concerns to the Manager. At no time did upper management ever acknowledge our complaint. 

It should be noted that during our stay the elevators were being renovated. So of the 6 elevators in the tower, only two worked. Getting upstairs or downstairs was a grind as many times the elevator was packed and you could not even get on. 

The room itself was clean. There was a nice bed with a crisp, white, comfortable duvet. They get points for this. The size was adequate, I did not feel cramped. Housekeeping did a great job. 

The workout room was great. There seemed to be an adequate number of machines. There was water, clean towels, and even ear phones available. 

The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle service that runs from the hotel to the Shinjuku Train station comes by every 20 minutes. This was useful. 

We ate our breakfast daily at the lobby restaurant. The breakfast buffet was quite varied and delicious. Service was always excellent. 

If only the front desk staff was not so clueless, our stay would have been perfect.",3,2013/06/18
1,REDACTED,en,2561,"Took the train to shinjuku station where we rode the free shuttle bus from the station to the Hilton Hotel. The shuttle comes every 15 minutes which makes it convenient for tourists. 

The hotel itself is located in a business district in Tokyo so there's not much happening at night. Also, not a lot of places to eat at around the area. The starbucks at the corner closes at 8pm! 

The hotel is a nice business hotel with rooms that are not the typical Japanese size -- the room was actually pretty spacious! We didn't get to try the breakfast buffet offered because we wanted to try different Japanese restaurants all over Tokyo. 

If you're the type of person who would like to spend a relaxing night inside the hotel rather than explore Tokyo, this is the perfect hotel for you!",4,2013/06/17

1,REDACTED,en,2564,The service at the Tokyo Hilton should be a model for other Hilton Hotels. It was equal to the service I received at the Conrad Tokyo. The Executive Lounge is a step above most Hilton Lounges in both food and service and in my opinion worth booking an executive room and not just hoping for an upgrade.,5,2013/06/15
1,REDACTED,en,2565,"I came to the hotel with minor reservations due to some comments about the smallish lobby, pool, and dated room decor. First, let me clarify - as far as U.S. travelers are concerned, the lobby is quite adequate and I would not have given it a second thought. The room did have a straight back rocket ship chair which could have been a prop in a 70's Bond movie and also had sliding panel windows but the room was spectacularly clean and comfortable. Also, the windows were marvelously large giving a truly great view of the streets and people especially for early risers. The pool is a bit smaller than the one at the Hilton Narita Airport - which probably has the best hotel pool that I have seen in 4 continents - but is quite adequate. That's about all regarding the concerns that I had heard about.

Now the good stuff - 
- Firstly, great staff. Very courteous, always trying to help and very willing to make suggestions (Ask for tea bags and creamer at 3:00 Am and you get it promptly with a smile and a bow).
- Probably either the best or second best breakfast buffet that I have ever seen (keep in mind the 4 continents remark above). Great Continental preparations, perfect omelettes 4 days in a row, great scrambled eggs, fresh fruit including ice cold litchis, great local yog(h)urt, fresh fruit juices and smoothies, emphatically the best hot chocolate I've ever had, decent breads, etc
- Rooms were quite comfortable with a nice firm mattress. quite spacious even for p90x workouts; smallish bathroom but not inconvenient.
- The GM, Jamie Mead, manages the hotel well and is well liked by this staff. He is receptive to constructive input and will address any valid issues. 
- Really nice amenities - much better quality than that offered by their American properties.
- Nice gym with a quiet section for those who are looking for some seclusion.

There is a free shuttle to the station and a paid shuttle (you can charge it to your room) to the airport. There is an underground shopping area with stores which are reasonable in terms of prices and restaurants. However, many of them are cash only i.e. no credit cards so exchange the money at a post office or bank when possible. Nice restaurants including Denny's which can be reached by walking a few minutes. Internet can be pricey but free if you are Gold or higher. 

All in all, I am looking forward to my next stay at the property and having unreasonably large breakfasts.",5,2013/06/14
1,REDACTED,en,2566,"I have stayed here many times, and it's my ""go to"" hotel in Tokyo. For me, location is fantastic to my office in Shinjuku. They do have shuttle bus service to the train station that is free, which is a bonus for me when I want to do some shopping or eat in that part of Shinjuku. A few of the staff members are simply outstanding and I would like to hire them myself, while others are simply awful. 
Some of the rooms have been upgraded in the sleeping areas, and not the bathrooms! Imagine gold fixtures, etc. The executive lounge is nice and accommodating. The wifi is spotty at best in the rooms. The food in the restaurants is mediocre and expensive. There is much better food in the area. 
The elevators are HORRIFIC! They take forever and if your are on one of the top floors, it can be very frustrating. I leave my room at least 10 minutes before I have to be in the lobby! It's that bad. 
The hotel is clean and tidy, but that's what we expect whilst visiting Japan.
In closing, I will continue to stay here secondary to the proximity to my office and because of the few staff members that make my visit enjoyable.",3,2013/06/13
1,REDACTED,en,2567,"We stayed in the Hilton Shinjuku for four nights. When we walked in, you could almost immediately tell that this hotel would be a nice one. The air in the hotel lobby has a subtle (more subtle than in typical Vegas strip hotels ;-) ) perfume smell which was nice. People at checkin were nice and English was not a problem (unlike many other place s in Japan).

We didn't have breakfast in the hotel, but the breakfast area looked very nice from what we could see. There was free fast wifi in the lobby and the business center had PCs + internet as well. We had a look at the gym and the swimming pool which was quite small but looked nice and clean. We had a room on the 24th floor with views towards the east which was very nice.

We found a very nice deal online for this hotel and for this price, the hotel was awesome. It is very close to Shinjuku station from where you can take the Yamanote train.


Tip: Visit the nearby metropolitan governement office which has a free observation deck.",4,2013/06/12
1,REDACTED,en,2568,"We picked this hotel because of an airline discount. The Hotel is a modern western, well it's a Hilton. It's a good location being in Shinjuku. There is a shuttle bus that takes you to the hotel from Shinjuku station which is bearable being in the heart of a city. 

My biggest problem was that there was no Free WiFi in the room. At 1600yen a night that isn't something to sneeze at either. 

Hotel room itself was very nice, beds were apparently quite comfortable from what my family said. I didn't notice which is a good thing. It's a busy hotel with many parties and get togethers so you can see a lot of traffic in the lobby. Of course internet is free in the lobby so you see a lot of people trying to use it down there as well.

Overall it was a pleasant stay but I may think of looking else where next time because of the WiFi charge and the hotel cost was not exactly cheap either. It is nice staying in Shinjuku though because all trains run through that station so you can get everywhere in Tokyo from it.",4,2013/06/11
1,REDACTED,en,2569,I agree with many of the spots for this property. I've stayed at Hilton's across the world and this one didn't disappoint.

We could explore very parts of Tokyo easily due to close proximity of the hotel to the subway station. The hotel offers complementary shuttle service to Shinjuku station three times an hour, which is really good.
Hotel staff speak English very well. All the staffs are very friendly and helpful. The room is very clean and provides all kinds of amenities in the bathroom.

The front desk manager was very nice n allowed us an early check-in ( coz we arrived early ) n as our flight the next day was at midnite, we requested a late check-out n was given 3pm. This was v helpful ( usual check-out is 10am ) but I doubt a late check-out is possible without staying at the executive club room. Anyway the hotel shuttle bus to shinjuku at every 20 mins is v helpful. The executive club is really good value. The room we had was the 38th floor, the bed linen of v gd quality. We slept v well. The staff at the club are extremely nice n make u feel very welcome. There are drinks, tea, cakes n breakfast at the club was good. It is nice for chilling out after shopping n before dinner or after dinner.We met an American man who told us it was his 5th visit at the hotel executive club n each visit was very good.

The Marble lounge, laid out with comfortable arrangements, was always buzzing with activity. Staff and service again was perfect.
I enjoyed the breakfast buffet every morning, a nice wide selection to choose from. Most other meals we ate out. Our last night we had a quick bite in St George's - share the Steak Frites, which was perfect for us.

They assigned us the renovated room but the shower partition was only covers a half length of bath tub and took some skill not the bathroom floor wet. Some refurbishment idea makes Me wonder. And 3 out of 6 elevators to the rooms and pool, spa was unavailable for the construction and so I asked at the check out and the bell desk, they could not give me even a ball park of schedule.

The bar at the ground floor was good as usual, not the fixed menu like other hotels in Japan. And I must confess their complementary Wasabi nuts for the cocktail is better than one the Business and First class of Airlines.

I did not see anybody brushing teeth at the washing area at the spa.

The several commuter trains are inter connected since last April, so more and more shops, restaurants and department stores in the Shinjuku area are competing - not just price, also the quality and variety. Since land dispute between Japan and China, some 30 to 40% less Tour Groups from China buys everything ""Made in Japan"", any large retail and airport, right now less you need to fight this crowd.",4,2013/06/03
1,REDACTED,en,2579,"We had a great stay at the hilton. it did take 2hrs on the shuttle bus from narita airport to get to (in traffic) so allow this time. The check in staff were warm and welcoming and concierge staff were extremely helpful and knowledgable for providing info on getting around on the trains. we enjoyed buffet breakfast each day, a nice spread. it is very busy hotel though, and often we had to wait 10mins or so to be seated so allow time. The shuttle bus to the train station works well, goes every 20mins. the only suggestion for this hotel would be to provide information on the shuttle bus timetable flyer (which we received at check in) that the bus departs from near the west exit of the station. we had a huge amount of trouble finding the bus stop, and asked about 10 locals where the 'Keio department store' that was listed on the flyer was, none of them knew or could understand our english . we walked in circles for 30mins before finally locating it. for our stay (4 nights) there was just 1 lift working, it was extremely frustrating and often meant waits of 10+ mins in the morning peak. I can understand lifts being out of order but 5 out of the 6 for such a large hotel was an inconvenience to guests.",4,2013/06/02
1,REDACTED,en,2580,"so here's my story why...
arrived at midnight at Haneda, the last regular shuttle was long gone.. had to take the special shuttle that dropped you at shinjiku station.. long walk to the hilton.. at midnight turned out to be longer than i expected... when i get into the hotel i get a room in the newer refurbished part of the hotel so thats the good part.. however the lobby is dark and grey.. kind of gives me a gotham city look and feel ... spooky.. which made me uncomfortable. somebody up there finds dark and grey sexy but i prefer warm and relatively bright and colorful decor.
rooms: smaller (compared to the hotel i stayed in my previous trips to tokyo) 
bed is comfortable (but small) 
bathrooms: New so thats always a nice thing.. but could have been better, i feel somebody has cut corners in designing the bathroom.
service can be better.. its like the front desk is full of smart alecks which kind of puts me off. and that combined with the dark and grey ambience really put me off. i definitely wont stay here if i had a choice!",2,2013/06/02
1,REDACTED,en,2581,"Prices are expensive for a room with no breakfast but well it's Hilton after all. The shuttle bus service to shinjuku station is handy. If u come back late though, it's a 10-15 min walk from the station. The concierge service was best part of all, they seemed to have 3 or so stationed at the desk n were really helpful with all our questions. Room was good; bit small but it's Japan I guess. Only downside is there's only free wifi in the lobby n not enough seats.",5,2013/06/01
1,REDACTED,en,2582,"This trip was my first to Tokyo, and certainly won't be the last. The same can be said for this hotel...
Having had not very good experiences with the Hilton chain in the past I was a bit wary of being booked in here - but I was in for a very pleasant surprise.
Executive level gave me executive treatment - from the floor manager to the girls in the lounge, everyone was polite and helpful.
Get the Limo Bus from Narita - it stops right outside the Hilton, then when you enter you are made so welcome.
It's not the gushing welcome you can occasionally get from some hotels, it was pitched just right. Also, my jetlag was minimal - probably due to the great beds and sleep quality.
Well done to all the staff.
I'll be back on November!",5,2013/06/01
1,REDACTED,en,2583,"Great stay here for three nights in the executive suite. Very large room, very clean, king bed with great linens, and awesome bathroom with a shower and tub room. Everything smelled new and had a pretty good view of the city from the room. Service was great, the concierge helped us get sumo tickets. Nice touches like an espresso machine in the room. Executive lounge was convenient for breakfast and appetizers and drinks in the evening. Some great views of the city sunset/sunrise from the lounge on the 35th floor. Location is pretty good, I never found any immediate dinner places around but everything is within a quick walk. There is a shuttle to the shinjuku station or a subway stop right beside the hotel if you don't want to make the 15 min walk to shinjuku. We used the tokyo meyro marunochi line and would get on/off at the nishi-shinjuku (stop m-7). Shinjuku is the next stop(m-8) where you can transfer to anywhere.",5,2013/06/01
1,REDACTED,en,2584,"This hotel is conveniently located at nishi-shinjiku which is close to the Oedo line and the red line. The hotel also offers a free shuttle bus to nishi-shinjiku station where you can connect to other lines as well. The room is clean and offers a great view of Tokyo. Unfortunately, during my stay I was not able to see Mt. Fuji from the hotel due to the hazy sky. 
As I am a diamond member, I was granted access to the Executive lounge during my stay which provided excellent breakfast options. They had both western style and Japanese style. I really love the coffee there, a great start of the day! At night, the lounge also provides free drinks and finger food. I am definitely happy with my stay here. The staff at the concierge were really nice and helpful as well. 

The only improvement the hotel can make is to renovate their guest rooms. Although clean and tidy, the room looks a bit dated. It was also a bit noisy at one night, I guess the guest upstairs were having a party at mid night.",4,2013/05/31
1,REDACTED,en,2585,"I stayed at the Hilton Tokyo for 5 nights as part of a business trip. The hotel, like the rest of Japan in general, was clean and efficient.

1,REDACTED,en,2586,"We used our HHonors points to redeem 2 nights stay while in Tokyo. We took the complimentary bus from Shinjuku station- bus stop 21 at west exit. As a diamond member, we were upgraded to the 37th floor next to the executive lounge. The rooms were very nice and spacious. My fav was the lounge as at 6pm we joined the pre-dinner drinks - and my wife enjoyed her Chandon. Staffs were very friendly and helpful - particularly when booking a restaurant for us prior to arrival. Only drawback was the location from Shinjuku station, but there is a metro across the street. Highly recommended.",5,2013/05/30
1,REDACTED,en,2587,The hotel was great in almost all aspects. The lounge staff is a little stiff. The lounge itself is overrun with people as well. I wish they would have just given me access to the mini bar in my room.,4,2013/05/30
1,REDACTED,en,2588,"Hotel is close to the Shinjuku Station and very convenient especially when there is a regular shuttle service between the hotel and the train station. The breakfast spread was very good, lots of healthy food selection.",4,2013/05/29
1,REDACTED,en,2589,"I have stayed in Tokyo on many occasions and in many different hotels. Shinjuku is the busy buzzing centre of Tokyo and when you find your way around you will know what I mean. I have stayed in the Hilton on several occasions over the past couple of years and this place is up there with the best of Japan's top branded hotels. 

I like the space I was always given, a large room that was a great plus amongst Japanese hotels that are usually very small in comparison to western standards. Clean and immaculate with good daily service. The Gym was modern and adequate with a good sized pool next door. I had a tattoo on my upper right arm that I simply covered with tube grip bandage and this was not a problem. Many hotels in Japan will simply ban you immediately from using facilities with tattoos. So I was thankful to the leisure staff team for there compromise and letting me swim. Food was great, breakfast was very good, although I ate out most of the times I stayed here. There was free wi fi in the lobby or business lounges but charged if needed in the room. This seems to be a Global Hilton policy not just here in Tokyo. I personally believe like many other hotels I frequent around the globe, Hilton group should make the Wi Fi complimentary in the rooms. Traveling business men and women will empathise with this. The British themed St George's bar is on the ground floor near lobby. Its quite a chilled out place that has jazz style live entertainment on many evenings, with food and an array of beverages.

There is a Metro station entrance across the road, ensure you have a map or one of the many great telephone apps if you don't know Tokyo. The Concierge desk are extremely helpful, polite and knowledgable, so ask for there advice. Most of the staff had very good English and were still very understanding and encouraging when I practiced my Japanese (Nihongo). Taxis in Japan are immediately available but are very expensive in Japan, the concierge staff will assist you in ensuring the drivers no exactly where they are going. Airport Limousine bus service is excellent as is all public transport in the area.

I, personally, have nothing but good to say about this place. The staff were always helpful, polite and proficient in all that I asked of them. This is clearly a very busy place (by japanese standards) and one should be forgiven sometimes if the concierge are not immediately there at the click of the fingers due to them already at full throttle dealing with the large amounts of customer demands. Credit to the staff from an experienced observer who can tell when working people are quite clearly giving their all during very demanding busy periods of the year. So much so that I believe some of the other negative reviewer comments are unwarranted in their comments whereby as such their comments would be equally the same in any other hotel under the same circumstances.

In summary a great friendly efficient hotel that is reasonably priced in comparison to the hotel competitors. There were many staff here I have met over the years and would if I could single them all out for their great service; so apologies for not doing that. However, Two that I have met on every occasion and are like friends to me are Kaori Hayashi San and Azusa Seshimo San, two ladies who have shown exemplary professional service during all my stays and always managing to make me feel uplifted even during my bad business days, a challenge in itself, well done.",5,2013/05/29
1,REDACTED,en,2590,I spent two days here and it was a very good experience. The staff was nice and spoke good english. The food was great and the room was first class. The room was very classy with amazing furnishings and a very comfortable king bed. The location was nice for me as I only had a short cab ride to the office. It was very nice to finish a hard days work and relax in a nice hotel.,5,2013/05/28
1,REDACTED,en,2591,"I stayed in Tokyo for both working and visits over the week-end, and the hotel was perfect for both purpose. 
Starting from the check-in the service is very great. Rooms are very clean, with modern design, nice cosmetic products in the bathroom. 
Wi-Fi is available and operational everywhere, and complementary if you are part of the HH program. 
Breakfast is awesome, with a nice combination of western and Asian dishes, fresh pancakes and fruit juices, with a very nice juice and coffee bars.
I had the chance to try the hotel bar, cocktails are nicely maid, you will find an interesting whisky selection, the atmosphere is really cozy and the service is even better: one waiter even offered us to complementary go buy cigarettes at the outside vending machine as the hotel was not selling any. 
The location is really convenient for visiting the city, with nearby metro station and great shopping area at walking distance. From the higher floors (I was in 23rd) the view is really great.
I’ll return!",5,2013/05/28
1,REDACTED,en,2592,"On our recent visit to Tokyo we used the Hilton Tokyo in Shinjuku for a week's stay exploring all this great city has to offer.

While we were disappointed that no rooms on the executive level were available - meaning we were also unable to access the executive lounge, that was really the only negative (and not much of one at that!) 

The morning breakfast buffet is outstanding - with a great mix of Japanese/Asian and Western dishes - and a fantastic assortment of fresh fruit and juices. 

Special thanks to GoTo in guest relations, who made a point to get to know us and see if he could offer assistance during our stay. We coordinated the purchase of sumo tickets through the hotel - which was a seamless and easy experience, and appreciated how easy it was to connect through the basement of the hotel directly to the subway line - for easy travel within the city.",4,2013/05/26

The room had an amazing view of the city with large glass windows! The only criticism I have is the concierge was always way too busy to be used, I had to wait often more than twenty minutes to get service which is disappointing as the staff were lovely and had great suggestions. I would definitely staff here again on my next trip to Tokyo.",4,2013/05/24
1,REDACTED,en,2595,"My husband and I spent a whole week at the Hilton Shinjuku both on business and pleasure. We had some concerns about the service and the breakfast because of previous reviews. However, being Hilton Honors members we chose the Hilton over other nice properties in the area. We must say we were extremely pleased with our choice. The service was exceptional from every department. After a VERY long trip from Orlando, Florida (17 hours in the air) we arrived tired and cranky. The front desk was courteous and quick. The breakfasts were extraordinary... American (eggs, bacon, waffles, pancakes, fruit bar, bakery bar etc.) Japanese (miso, rice, fish, seaweed, kelp etc.) Juice/Smoothie bar (delicious healthy concoctions of fruit, vegetables and the sorts) and of course a variety of both teas and coffees got the morning off to a good start. The servers were considerably better then expected and really highlighted ""Japanese Hospitality"".
However, the best thing about this particular hotel has got to be the concierge staff. Since we both travel extensively to foreign countries we rely heavily on the knowledge and support of the 
people behind the concierge desk and in this department the Hilton Tokyo excelled. For example, we were told by a different hotel's concierge staff that there was no ""Dressage"" in Tokyo. The Park Hyatt staff was at least aware of the riding stable but was convinced that there was NO public access. After returning to our hotel we asked Aoki-san to look into the matter. After a quick search on the net and a phone call she produced completely different information. We are pleased to share that she alone was absolutely accurate. A foreigner can get a riding lesson in Dressage at the Tokyo Riding Club, and do it in English! This is just one example of how accurate information can change the course of a trip and we owe many thanks to Aoki-san for doing a great job every single morning. Whether business or pleasure we recommend this property for its helpful and knowledgeable staff.",5,2013/05/24
1,REDACTED,en,2596,"I stayed here on my last 2 days. It was a bit more expensive than the hotel I came from, but it is very nice. The rooms are great and the hotel bars and restaraunts are very good. Great location to the Imperial Palace, Tokyo Tower and the coolest electronics store I have ever seen, 8 floors of nothing but state of the art technology. Beds and bath were top notch",5,2013/05/24
1,REDACTED,en,2597,"My wife and I stayed here during my business trip to Tokyo and we were not disappointed. The Hilton Tokyo is an amazing place, especially if you hold Diamond status or are staying on the executive floor. The rooms were typical - perfectly appointed and very quiet but what really made me happy and will make us stay here next time is the executive lounge. Just amazing, from the full buffet breakfast to the evening food (which was more than enough for a full dinner if you're looking to save money). The evening food consisted of snacks, cheese, several hot items and unlimited alcoholic beverages - yes, you heard me right! As much as this made us happy, what really got me was the apple juice! Yes, the apple juice. For some reason the apple juice in Japan is incredible. I had a glass at almost every meal or time we stopped in. We'd grab some waters in the morning and evening and I'd always have an apple juice as well. 
Overall, this was one of the best Hilton's I've ever stayed in.",5,2013/05/23
1,REDACTED,en,2598,"We stayed for 3 nights at this Hilton, we had a nice room with a good view on the 25th floor, spotlessly clean and very comfy bed and pillows.
Personally if in Tokyo again we would probably stay in a different area to have more life around in the evenings however this hotel was very close to the main station and local subway so travel was very easy.",4,2013/05/20
1,REDACTED,en,2599,"This is the fourth time I have stayed at this hotel and it is still as good as the first time I stayed. Even though the hotel was very busy (I always stay during Golden week), the staff always run a very slick operation. The only gripe I have is that as the hotel is being refurbished half of the lifts were out of action, so there were queues for the lifts at peak times, which was frustrating.
The breakfast buffet is amazing and the staff never rush you, which is just as well because I always make sure I have a hearty breakfast!!
There is just one more point I would like to make...can you please make wifi available in all rooms free of charge!!!",4,2013/05/20

The Executive Lounge provides a second-to-none service; the hotel fitness centre is terrific (though the pool isn't quite long enough for my liking - but you can't have everything) ; the internet connection is great, and the staff extremely friendly and helpful throughout the hotel.",5,2013/05/16
1,REDACTED,en,2604,"This is my second visit within three months and needless to say the service at the Hilton Tokyo is absolutely first class. I arrived this morning via overnight flight and although I had requested for early check-in, I knew it will be really a blessing if i get a room at 8:45 am in the morning. The lady at the reception was extremely customer oriented and made every single afford to get me a room and by 11:30 am, I was already comfortably in my room. 

The booking I made did not seem to reflect properly in the record but once again, without any hassle and within minutes, everything was sorted out. In fact, the room that I am check-in might have cost more but very efficiently, I was assured that the original cost that was in my reservation will be honored and no additional charges will incurred.

During my last trip, I stayed at the King City Executive Suite and was given the same room this round however, the room still needs a bit of fixture especially with the ""compact"" bathroom that could do with a face-lift. I guess renovation might still be going on but it would be great to stay in a renovated room for this trip. At least the service has made a great difference and the team at the Executive Lounge is extremely helpful. Looking forward to the next few nights in this great hotel.",4,2013/05/15
1,REDACTED,en,2605,"As this was my first trip to Japan I was not sure what to expect and what not to expect from a Hilton Brand hotel. The room was OK (34th floor), the check-in at the Executive Lounge was also smooth and we got a room despite our early arrival at 11am. 

I was however a bit surprised to find such a small gym in a hotel targeting business travellers. Very cramped inside and no offering of a bottle of water as I normally get at Hilton / Conrad in Beijing, Shanghai and Bangkok. 

The lounge was also very small for the number of guests using it. Again compared to the cities above there was often very cramped inside, very noisy with especially US-guests having meetings or loud discussions in the lounge. Friday and Saturday evening is was completely full 1 hour into the cocktail time. Vouchers for drinks and food in a separate area of St Georges Bar was given and downstairs was actually more quiet and relaxing.

The most annoying part of the stay was that 3 out of 6 elevators where out of service. Apparently for refurbishment. It meant going from Lobby level to 34th or simply from 37th to 34th could take a very long time. I heard many other guests complain about this.",4,2013/05/15

The breakfast buffet is terrific, it wasn't included in our room rate, but we found it well worth the expense. The dinner restaurants in the hotel are extremely overpriced.

The hotel met all our expectations and as it was winter and cold outdoors we were able to connect between buildings through the maze of underground passage ways. All the office blocks have an array of restaurants open in the basement levels with great food.

The Executive Lounge is the best I've experienced at other Hiltons and similar hotels. We ate there most of the time.

Regarding the city - very clean. The down side is Narita Airport is 2 to 3 hours away. Take the bus (pay in advance) to get to the hotel. There isn't any benefit to a cab and it will cost you $200 American per person. The traffic is terrible - hotel is great - the women in the Executive Lounge even better! Bring one home.",5,2013/05/10

The Conrads is obviously newer Hotel, both are located in Shinjuku district. Service at this hotel is excellent, everyone speaks English. We stayed at the junior suite and it is newly renovated and nice. The hotel itself is older and you can tell by the elevator. Breakfast service is great, they have free Wifi at the lobby. There are many pilots and flight attendants stay here. There is a bus to the local Shinjuku subway station and there is also another subway stop right outside the hotel door. Skyline through out window is great, we stayed at the 28th floor. Would definitely return in the future.",5,2013/05/10
1,REDACTED,en,2614,"For first time visitors, the Tokyo Hilton was a fine base from which to explore Tokyo and surrounding country. It is convenient to Narita transportation [airport busses stop right in the driveway and Shinjuku train station is 1Km away. We used the Narita Express train]. Visitors would be smart to use the bus unless they know their way around Shinjuku.

The Hilton Hotel sits amidst the skyscrapers of the Shinjuku district. This is a spotlessly clean area of modern buildings. Outside and in common areas, the Hilton fit this description. Our room was surprisingly large, very quiet, and had all the executive amenities expected from the Hilton brand. The view was outstanding. The only physical area we thought they might improve was the condition of some of the fixtures in the bathroom where years of high occupancy have started to show. It is also worth mentioning that Internet is expensive – around $16.50 per day. 

English was no problem. The front desk and baggage storage employees were very friendly, eager to communicate, and quite helpful. We looked for, but did not see, an activities planning desk. We would have found such an activities desk helpful to answer some basic questions about sightseeing in Tokyo and surrounding countryside.",4,2013/05/08
1,REDACTED,en,2615,"This hotel is huge but service is a bit impersonal. Always crowded in the lobby but check in was efficient. We booked two rooms but on different floors. The higher floor is refurbished but the lower one is old with old fittings. 

We stayed 4 nights during winter and the free shuttle to shinjuku station runs infrequently ( every 30 minutes). So if you miss the shuttle the walk from station is quite far and a bit unbearable especially during cold winter day. The area around the hotel is very quiet and is surrounded by office buildings. Department stores such as Takashimaya and Isetan are on the opposite site of the station exit. If you arrive by shinkansen remember to look for west exit. We made mistake by exiting through southern exit and walked a long distance to the hotel (one hour in cold windy evening).

I would not stay again in this hotel even though the price is quite reasonable. The location is its major drawback. If I visit Tokyo again I will stay in hotels around Shibuya station.",3,2013/05/08
1,REDACTED,en,2616,"We stayed in Hilton Shinjuku in January and now I beleive it's not the best time for visiting Tokyo. There was too cold and too windy, more than in weather forecasts. 

One of the Hilton's conveniences is its transport accessibility. There is a direct bus line from Narita, a shuttle bus to Shinjuku station and an exit to subway from the lobby. But it's far enough from central Tokyo, it took about a half our to get to Tokyo station.

Actually I have nothing more to say about good or bad things in this Hilton. Hilton Shinjuku as standard as standard hotel could be. When you check in you will get a standard room, standard breakfast, standard service, etc. 

But why they made worktable's stems so cruelly hard and wide-sticked?? We hurt all our toes! And there was not a Hilton duck in a bathroom.

Yes, I know that's nothing important and Hilton Shinjuku is OK, but... Actually it's absolutely not about the Hilton amenities! It's about ""Where is Hilton's magic?!""

And may be I'm too critical, but I wonder why Hilton Tokyo was so boring, so ordinary? And ... where is the duck?)",4,2013/05/08

We were on a standby upgrade which sadly we didn't get as that would have been the icing on the cake. As we were out of our room all day we didn't want to pay for wi-fi but as soon as we entered the lobby we were all frantically connecting before either leaving on the shuttle or returning to our rooms! 
In the next block was a Starbucks which we used for breakfast a couple of times and a little supermarket which was great, the children loved the Japanese sweet selection.
The shuttle to Shinjuku station was great, always on time and super convenient.
Our room had lovely Japanese touches despite being a global chain. We loved the traditional robes, screens instead of curtains and china tea pot. The staff were lovely.

Our room was excellent with a terrific view and the bed and bath hugely comfortable and sparkling clean. The concierge desk helped us in every possible way and were knowledgeable in the extreme.

1,REDACTED,en,2622,"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. At first we were given a room that look so outdated with such an old looking bathroom that we asked to be allocated another room. We were told that no rooms were available for the first night but we could move the next day. The new room we were allocated was much better - I believe they are in the process of renovating some rooms.
Hotel is ok, nothing special. You have to pay for WiFi which is a bit ridiculous as everywhere else we stayed in Japan for the following 2 weeks (even in small village hotels), WiFi was included in the price and available in the room.
Buffet breakfast is good but arrive early because queues can be long for getting a table. The first morning, I asked for warm milk for my coffee at least 3 times and never got it. The next day when I asked for it, I got cold milk. I don't think it is a language problem, I just think the waiters are so busy with breakfast service that they can be unattentive at times.
The hotel is less than 10 minutes walking from Shinjuku station. There is a shuttle that goes from the hotel to the station but walking is so much easier that we never used the shuttle during out stay.",3,2013/05/04

1,REDACTED,en,2626,"We stayed at the Hilton Tokyo for a week with 2 children aged 11 & 9. We chose a junior suite as we could fit 2 rollaway beds in the room for the kids. We still had adequate space to move around the room. The view was great from the 28th floor. The beds were extremely comfortable and the room was very quiet. We used the shuttle bus a lot and it was very efficient. You just need to take note of the departure times, as they only run every 20 mins. Used the swimming pool once, but it was really only a lap pool with 2 lanes. One for lap swimming & one for playing. The staff were extremely polite and helpful. We arrived on a very early flight, and by the time we arrived at the Hilton it was still too early to check in. The staff were extremely helpful and stored our luggage for us, and gave us an exact time that the room would be ready (1pm). We just went back into Shinjuku for an early lunch. Please note that when we booked we contacted the hotel directly and were advised that 2 rollaway beds could be put in the suites for free. This made the cost reasonable compared to 2 standard rooms. Since then they have changed policy and it now costs 7000Yen per extra bed,per night. This would make it very expensive for families.",4,2013/04/29

1,REDACTED,en,2629,"We spent 5 nights at the Tokyo Hilton while my husband had business in Tokyo. Overall it was a great stay and I would definitely go back.

Our room was very nice and quiet- we were on the Executive level. We had a lovely high view of the city. The Executive Lounge was wonderful and the staff was very attentive.

The location of the hotel was great for us- plenty of places to eat nearby and it was so easy to get around the city from this location. We used the metro and found it very easy. 

This is a VERY busy hotel- it is large and was always full. The lobby could be overwhelming at times, but we could always find someone to help if needed. We ate one night at the Italian buffet in the hotel and although the food was good- the price was ridiculously high. Not out of line for other hotel restaurants, though.

My only negative was the elevators. They are refurbishing the elevators and trying to get down to the main level from the 36th floor at busy times was difficult. We had to catch a 8:00 am tour and got to the elevators at 8:45- by 9:00 we still were not able to get down- every elevator was filled to the brim. We ran to the Executive lounge Concierge who was wonderful and took us down the back service elevator- we were still not down until 9:10. 

Breakfast at both the main restaurant and the Executive lounge was wonderful and the gym is outstanding.

Definitely a big hotel in a big city- but all in all a great stay!",4,2013/04/29

And by that matter we had to spend more time to disturbed the peoples at the reception desk! Plus if you want to have wi-fi in the lounge lobby , you got to drink or eat (10$us for a coffee!).

The staff in the executive lounge were fantastic - so very friendly and very accommodating of our limited Japanese speaking skills. The umbrellas on our one rainy day were a great touch and highly appreciated. 

The spa and fitness centre was an interesting experience - it was great to try the traditional Japanese way of bathing without having to venture too far out of my comfort zone! I only wished I'd discovered it earlier into my stay. 

I hope to return soon and use some of my hhonors points!",5,2013/04/25
1,REDACTED,en,2634,"This is the first time I have stayed at the Hilton and normally stay at the Okura for business. The bus from Narita Airport was easy to find, usually efficient, quick and stopped only a couple of times on the way. I arrived too early for my room and had to use the gym facilities to take a shower to prepare for my day. The locker room was small and compact and the shower facilities a bit lacking. With others using the facility, it was not easy to manage a suitcase is such tight confines. 

The room was clean and adequate with a comfortable bed. I did have a room service meal one night and did not really enjoy the food. 

Breakfast was quite manic in the mornings and always very busy. A couple of mornings I had to line up for nearly 5 minutes before I could get a seat.

Even though it rained the entire 5 days, I was always able to get a taxi out side. The only issue I found with the taxi spot was it is situated next to the smokers area outside the hotel and had to walk the gauntlet each morning.

Overall, good value and I will certainly be staying with the Hilton on return later in the year.",4,2013/04/25

1,REDACTED,en,2636,"We stayed at the Hilton, Tokyo for 4 nights with a baby. We chose this hotel as we often use our HIlton Honours and thsi was a great choice for busy and expensive Tokyo. We had a free upgrade (always a bonus), and were given a fantastically huge suite on the 18th floor (these rooms are brand new and fully renovated). The suite had all mod cons and excellent tolietries etc.
By far one of the best breakfasts we have had with an excellent buffet breakfast, with a wide range of western and Asian dishes to suit all tastes. We often packed sandwiches and fruits and yoghurts for the rest of the day too..(Please note, there are no highchairs at this hotel so if you have a baby, then pack a travel one).
There is a metro station beneath the hotel which proved really useful when travelling around Tokyo (we didn't use a taxi, but loved hopping on a train and exploring the fabulous city).
We stumbled across a really interesting flea market one Sunday morning, it is next to the hotel, so check it out (opposite the green tower where Starbucks is located). 
We also made great use of the free shuttle tfrom the hotel o the Shinjuku which was really convenient. Also, grab a map and make sure you know the basics of where you want to go as some places simply don't speak English.
The hotel staff was impeccably polite and courteous throughout.

I traveled with my wife and two sons families. We were there to celebrate our one son's wedding. I used honor points for the stay and arranged accommodations for my son and his new bride. The staff was very excited about the new couple and arranged their room on the executive level with sweeping views of the city. 
Our room was a king bed room on a high floor and was very impressive. The room was large by Japanese standards and very contemporary. Everything was in working order and the room was clean and inviting. 
The staff of this hotel were very accommodating and went out of their way to make sure that everything was perfect. This was our first trip to Japan so I had quite a few encounters with the staff asking questions and making requests. I always found employees were genuinely interested in making sure that the stay and advise would make our stay enjoyable. I was very impressed with the professional and personal care we were afforded while staying at this facility.",5,2013/04/21

Restaurants/Cafes to pick up something quick to eat are nearby on Ome Kaido Ave. Room was very clean and comfortable and service was excellent. The Executive lounge has a variety of appetizers in the evening. One of the nights we were there the Executive Lounge was at capacity, so the staff made a duplicate set up in a private room off the bar.

It has something for every taste, and you can get a 1000 Yen discount if you pre-purchase it when you check in. Even if you don't, I thought the price was still reasonable.

I was also able to admire the beautiful night scene of Tokyo from my room. Just Beautiful. The only drawback is the use of internet in the room which is chargeable.

Being simply Silver, the Twin Exec was disappointing. Decor moderate, bathroom super tiny and my view was average. The Exec lounge is always important to me as I don't venture out alone often in the evenings. This one has great views, a good assortment of food(evening and morning) and beverages. Free Wifi on the Exec floors is a huge bonus as well.",4,2013/04/18
1,REDACTED,en,2647,"We stayed in an Executive room from 10-14 April.

We appreciated the fact that the hotel gave us a non-smoking room as requested previously via email due to allergies. We also appreciated that the hotel provided a roll-out bed for the third person, we were 3 adults sharing without being asked - the room was a little cramped it was true after the addition of the third bed but this was more than compensated by the fact that the beds were all very comfortable.

Reception was efficient albeit a little slow but I think that this was due to so many people checking into the hotel at the same time. This was also a problem with the lifts, which was made worse by the fact that 2 were out of action due to maintenance.

We had to go to Tokyo SkyTree urgently and concierge was able to assist very effectively - plus everyone that we came into contact with spoke fair to excellent English, not always the case in Japan.

The rooms were immaculate, again with the correct number of towels and toiletries provided and replenished every day, again not always the case in Japan, especially for triple share. Housekeeping I think did a great job.

Location was excellent, in the Shinjuku area of Tokyo - very close to Tochomae subway, albeit a little far from main stations like Shinjuku, although a periodic shuttle was provided from the hotel to Shinjuku free.

The only small issue that stops this hotel from being perfect was that when I asked for our flights to be re-confirmed for me the lady at the bell desk was perfectly willing to oblige - by calling the airline concerned from 9am and then handing the phone over to me to re-confirm myself. I'd ask the question of her at around 7am on a weekday.

She advised me that it seemed that the airline re-confirmation office was only open from 9-5pm (for Korean airlines) and thus it was only possible to do any sort of re-confirmations during that time. 

Unfortunately due to day tours it was not possible for me to be at the hotel during those hours, thus I was prepared to perform the re-confirmations myself. I was a little surprised that I'd be expected to re-confirm myself in essence since this was a service advertised by the hotel. 
The assistance from the bell desk seems to be just ringing the airline concerned - which to be frank I could have done myself.

I ended up ringing the airline myself on another date (around 10pm from my mobile) and was advised by the surprised airline that their re-confirmation line are opened 24/7. Perhaps the lady who assisted me was not trained about this - at all times she was most willing to help to the best of her ability. Perhaps training in this area can be improved, unless I was expecting too much as far as this service was concerned.

It is definitely worth it to reserve an Executive room if you can since Executive Lounge access is included plus their excellent breakfast. The Lounge itself was small and thus it may be necessary to go early to ensure access to the Lounge because it does get very busy sometimes.
Internet was also free for Executive rooms, not the case for Standard rooms.

I did not eat at any of the restaurants at the hotel, there were plenty of nearby eateries that seemed to be cheaper.

In summary I'd definitely stay at the Hilton Shinjuku again - service was excellent and staff also spoke very good to excellent English.",4,2013/04/17
1,REDACTED,en,2648,"For our two-day stay, we took the very convenient AirportLimousine bus directly to the hotel front door from Narita. On a Sunday afternoon the trip was slightly less than the advertised two hours. We considered the express train, which would have saved some time, but would have required getting from Shinjuku station to the hotel somehow, and with a lot of luggage, the train is not a great option. The return trip to the airport on a Tuesday afternoon took about an hour and a half.

From the moment we arrived at the hotel, the service was generally excellent, as one would hope for from a Hilton hotel, and as one would generally expect at high-end Tokyo hotels. Check-in was quick and pleasant, and the front desk clerk was happy to allow for a late check-out on our day of departure. The concierge was helpful and efficient in booking our return to the airport. The one exception to the service being excellent was in the lobby restaurant during breakfast (3600 yen per person for the buffet… yikes), where the servers seemed overwhelmed, and it took quite some time to get our bill, even after giving our room number twice to the same person (once before we sat down and once when we finally were able to flag someone down).

The room was very good, not excellent. My guess is that we were in a room that had not yet been refurbished, but I’m not sure. Everything was clean and in good working order. Decent drawer space, although not great. In-room safe was a good size and easy to use. The bed was very comfortable. Quite large flat screen TV at the foot of the bed, where it belongs (but where not every hotel puts it). The desk provided a good working area.

Bathroom was fine, although not particularly large. Shower in tub had adjustable shower head (nothing special) and a hand sprayer. Toilet had standard Japanese attachment on the seat. Everything was fine, just not excellent.

In-room wi-fi was fast and reliable, although we had some issues with having to log in (and pay the daily rate) more often than we should have. However, a quick discussion at the front desk before checking out resulted in the appropriate adjustment. Wi-fi is free in the lobby; I see that other reviewers reported slow speeds but at busy times; when we tried it (at an off-peak time) it was fine.

Hotel’s location was fine for us, but might be very good instead of excellent for some travellers. It’s about a 15-minute walk to Shinjuku metro station and shopping area, and we enjoyed the walk, but some may not like having to do that in order to get to a busy area (there’s very little right around the hotel), and you may not want to depend upon the hotel’s periodic shuttle to and from the station. Alternatively, it’s only about a 5-6 minute walk to Nishi-shinjuku station, which is on just one line, so it’s closer but may then require a transfer depending upon where you’re going. Both stations are accessible underground from the hotel, which is very convenient especially in bad weather.

Check-out was quick and smooth.

No real complaints, and I happily give the hotel a “very good” rating.",4,2013/04/16
1,REDACTED,en,2649,"Pros: * A nice, slightly Asian feel to room-reasonably priced upgrade on 
early arrival:)
*Free shuttle bus to station & good casual dining/bars in that area too:)
*Proximity to gardens - saw end of cherry blossom in early April:)
*A couple of places nearby with reasonably priced breakfast-
we liked Dendy sp? (near Starbucks) as over-looked park, fresh mango etc:)
*Lovely indoor pool - deck chairs with a view too:)
*Most of the staff were very helpful (see below)

Cons: *The female concierge was helpful but there was a male who gave 
incorrect information which could have resulted in us missing a
main attraction - the nearby garden. He said ""closed on 
Mondays"" (it was open that Monday 15 April) & ""blossom finished"" 
- it wasn't! We have beautiful photos to prove that. Fortunately
we checked at the tourist information office or we would have
missed this on our short stay in Toyko. This staff member needs
some professional development about importance of checking his 
facts. His attitude - rather disinterested - needed improvement
too but at least prompted us to check the validity of his 
information.
*Breakfast in the hotel is expensive - maybe not for Japan but definitely
compared to many other hotels in Asia, Australia & Europe.

1,REDACTED,en,2650,"This cherry blossoms reason we chose to stay at the Hilton Tokyo again because of its location and value for money. The hotel operates a shuttle bus to/from JR Shinjuku station every 20 minutes and this is the convenience we cannot live without in Tokyo! In addition, there's a subway line right under the hotel connecting you directly to Ginza. We checked in very late and because of this reason (not sure) we were offered an upgrade to a recently renovated room on a smoking floor. We LOVED it. The renovated room is very clean and modern. The bathroom in particular is very chic and classy.

Wi-Fi is still not free. If you really need access to internet it's cheaper to rent a portable Wi-Fi hotspot even if your stay in Japan is short. Breakfast is good but very crowded. Gym is sufficient and open 24/7. The concierge can provide you with umbrellas should it rain outside. By and large we are not disappointed with our second time stay here.",4,2013/04/15
1,REDACTED,en,2651,"Let me preface by saying I've been a Hilton Diamond member for seven consecutive years; therefore, I almost always stay at a Hilton property and have that as a frame of reference. I recently completed a 13 night stay at this Hilton property and have stayed twice before, as well as two previous stays at the Conrad across town in Shiodome...

Overall, I really like this Hilton; the front desk, executive lounge, concierge, gym and cleaning staffs are all friendly and accommodating in a typically deferential and polite Japanese manner. The executive lounge is spacious enough that it never felt too crowded (a pervasive Hilton issue these days, it seems), the food selection was excellent and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Moreover, the hotel is clean, the beds are comfortable, the rooms are modern and nice and the common areas are kept up nicely.

Regarding the location, I love nishi-Shinjuku; directly north of the hotel is the Nishi-Shinjuku metro stop on the Marunouchi Line; just south of the hotel is the Tochomae stop on the Oedo Line. Both of these lines - as well as a hotel shuttle and your two feet - will take you to the Shinjuku Station nearby, which then opens up a whole new world of travel options (busiest train station in the world.) Additionally, a host of great food options await in close proximity to the hotel, including the Hiltopia shopping and dining experience directly beneath the hotel. Finally, Shinjuku Chuo park is literally 100 yards outside the front door; it's great for a stroll, jog or sit to enjoy a sunny Tokyo day.",4,2013/04/14

The Hilton is superbly located with direct access to the closest metro station Nishi-Shinjuku via a small shopping mall from the foyer to explore what Tokyo has to offer. There is a direct airport shuttle bus door to door from Narita airport. Book from the desk at the airport (travel time approx 90mins) and book at concierge for your return to the airport.
There are plenty of friendly english speaking staff eager to assist. 
We booked a King City View Executive Suite for three adults as we required a third bed. The beds are very comfortable with fantastic pillows and free wifi. The room was spotless with a fantastic city view.
We were able to leave our main luggage for a few days with concierge when we went to Kyoto before we checked into the Hilton again two days later.
We had access to the executive lounge. We never had to wait to be seated and the staff kept the tasty selection of nibbles well stocked. I have no hesitation in recommending The Hilton Tokyo.",5,2013/04/14

We have a standard room, and this easily accomodates us. Our room is faultless and we feel very comfortable here. Check in this afternoon was great and the young lady from Moldovia(?) assisted us and gave some great recommendations to assist us with our stay here.If this young lady is representative of Hilton's staff, then Hilton is a very lucky company indeed. Wifi in the room is great (and despite being USD18 for 24hrs - which I personally do not find to be expensive at all) however the wifi (free) in the lobby is slower than the backroads of Tibet (maybe because there were so many people there at the time.
We have never stayed in a Hilton hotel before today and you can rest assured it will be our hotel of choice in the future. Hilton understands that if the kids are kept happy then mum and dad will be thrilled.

The location was convenient with the quick access to the subway, and the complimentary shuttle to the nearby Shinjuku train station. If you can stomach the bill, the morning buffet was a great way to start the day.",4,2013/04/09
1,REDACTED,en,2656,"I booked a room for a non-smoking junior suite, but when we arrived, there weren't any rooms so we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite. It was very luxurious and new since it was remodeled recently. The only thing that was not very convenient was the small bathroom compared to the big rooms. We got a good deal on the breakfast buffet and WiFi so it wasn't an outrageous price. But the buffet was quite delicious so it was worth the money. The staff spoke English very well. The limousine service was great since it was a reasonable price. There are many restaurants on the 2nd floor and they have a 24 hour room service. The elevators were slow at times, but I think that after they are finally finished with the remodeling, it will run better. All in all, we enjoyed our stay at the Hilton. Even though it may be a bit expensive, one can find good deals. It is in the heart of Shinjuku so this is also a plus.",5,2013/04/09
1,REDACTED,en,2657,"We checked into the Hilton Tokyo on Thursday Mar 28, even though it was 1100pm, the staff was courteous and friendly. Our room was very nice, was only refurbished three weeks ago, according to the front desk personnel. The hotel has a very convenient shuttle to Shinjuku JR station, and also easy underground access to the Marunouchi subway line. For the price of 20925yen, it was a bargain. The bathroom was unique, with a large shower and tub, sorta Japanese furo like. Very nice! Would certainly stay there again.",5,2013/04/08
1,REDACTED,en,2658,"Good english speaking staff, I would rate it excellent except my checkout experience wasn't so good..Check in was flawless! 
Room was spacious, clean and comfortable. A bit dated but comfortable. 
Breakfast buffet was expensive but it was good!! 
Room service was good but not sure about charging $10 for a can of soft drink. Go downstairs to the carpark and you will find a drinks vending machine. If not cross the street and under the Hyatt there is a family mart!",4,2013/04/08
1,REDACTED,en,2659,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights upon our arrival in Japan, before flying to another city for business. It was a wonderful hotel with a very helpful and friendly staff and a great breakfast buffet. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We took the train from Narita to the Shinjuku station and then took the shuttle to the hotel. We did have a difficult time finding our way out of the station, but a very kind soul led us to the bus stop. This hotel was a great first stop on a wonderful trip to Japan.",5,2013/04/08
1,REDACTED,en,2660,"My first trip to Tokyo alone and I chose Hilton Tokyo because of the Airport Limousine transfer (JPY3000). The bus stopped right in front of the lobby, which was great as it started to rain on the way to the hotel. Better still, this was the first stop of the bus going back to the airport, so you get a sure ride and won't miss check-in time. The bus passed by Shinjuku station to pick up passengers, which only allowed a few passengers as there was a long queue. There's more to like about Hilton: very fluent English-speaking front desk staff, helpful concierge, free shuttle service to Shinjuku station every 20 minutes, plenty of choices for breakfast. I am not jumping up and down on the size of the Queen Deluxe room, although the bed is comfortable and you will get a good night's rest. The bathtub was tight, even for Asian standard. No complimentary water in the room and no internet as well.",4,2013/04/08
1,REDACTED,en,2661,"Pros
-Perfect location: one top of two subway stations, part of the airport limousine bus line, easy to walk around-Shinjuku shuttle makes everything even more convenient.
-English speaking and extremely helpful staff
-Big and comfy beds/pillows
-Great buffet and drink selection in the Executive lounge

Cons
-Even though we stayed in one of their suites, it was an outdated room/bathroom which surprised me considering the price we paid.
-Really small bathroom considering it was a suite
-Could hear upstairs neighbors a night or two

Overall, I would really give it 4.5 stars because the Executive Lounge really needs to be bigger and have more outlets for computer ports. Hopefully when they finish the renovation (which we saw or heard none during our stay) all the rooms would be nicer and I would give it 5 stars then. Overall a really fantastic hotel which we would stay in again. We had such a nice feeling the entire time and were sad to leave!",4,2013/04/07
1,REDACTED,en,2662,"Stayed here for my honeymoon & yes, everyone was super friendly & helpful. Unlike most parts of Tokyo, front staff at hotels speak English so that calmed my fears. We had requested a king-sized bed but due to the hotel being at full capacity because of all the rugby competitions & various other events, we were given a queen but the front desk sent chocolates & wine up to our room (SWEET!).

Room was recently remodeled & shower door only covered half of the tub, which was just a teeny bit odd & made the water from the showerhead spill out onto the floor every single time we showered. I didn't understand the concept but was told that it was a modern touch to the bathtub...flat screen TV with mostly Japanese channels with a handful of English-speaking channels...bed was comparable to ones at other nice hotels except the pillows were a bit too firm for me (as I'm used to memory foam ones). The shoji paper sliding door partition was a nice touch that replaced traditional draperies. I got a kick out of the toilet, with its water-spritzing features, which are everywhere in Japan but seldom seen in the U.S. There are complimentary toothbrushes & toothpaste that is part of the freebies in the bathroom. I wished that more U.S. hotels would have these items as standard ones along with the shampoo & conditioner.

Very convenient location with free shuttle service that runs every 20 mins (super convenient & VERY punctual) early in the morning to around 9pm at night from the hotel to the large Shinjuku train station. There is also a train station right outside the hotel as well. We walked everywhere & used the rail & subway systems...just let someone at the info booth know where you're going & they can tell you how much to pay & which # train to hop on (simple to navigate; do not be scared). Also, if you did not pay enough or too much, they have a readjustment station so that you can either pay more or get a refund.

Only downside to the hotel was that they were renovating/remodeling when we stayed there so only 2 of the 6 elevators operated at one time which required waiting of up to 10 minutes (the trick is to just go up & then come down...do NOT just press the down button & hope you'll get on...by the time it comes down to you, it will be filled with all the people on top levels trying to come down as well). One time there were too many people waiting so I just took the stairs down (going down is always easier than going up). Also, there was construction noise from the other rooms during the afternoon hours.",5,2013/04/05
1,REDACTED,en,2663,"The hotel is easy to get to by catching the subway to Nishi Shinjuku and walking out of exit 1 and turning right and walking for 200m. You can also go to Shinjuku station and get a free Hilton shuttle every 10 mins. There is not much touristy stuff right near you, but a short train or 15 minute walk and the options are endless. The hotel is in a business district, but accessibility made this a non issue.

We were warmly welcomed by the check in staff and they went above and beyond. It's always nice to get more than just ""passport and credit card"" fromcheck in staff. I commend them on their exceptional customer service.

The rooms are contemporary, large and comfortable. We arrived back in the middle of our room servicing one day and the staff member was so gracious and sped through her work (which she didnt need to as we weren't fussed). She was delightful and extremely courteous. Again, I commend the hotel on training the room staff for exceptional customer service.

I would have given this hotel a perfect rating except for a few small issues which normally I would deal with, except that this is a large international hotel that should not have these issues. When we first arrived we needed a good coffee and saw the lobby had a barista so we headed there. The waiter who was European approached us and we asked for 2 Machiato's. His response was a curt 'it's to on the menu'. As I saw a barista I suggested that they could probably do it for us and he again said, not, it's not on the menu. That irritated me so much I just got up and walked out. I've thought about this and I know under normal circumstances that would be petty and irrelevant and have just dealt with this, but this is a Hilton and a Europen waiter should have plugged his brain in and sailor led it out. Maybe he had a bad day, maybe I did, but hat was bad form and I've written this so the Managment knows how one little thing can become an irritant.

Anyway, to put it in perspective, the hotel is fabulous, all other staff memebers were exception (we ate one dinner in one of the restaurants as well as breakfasts) so I would definatley recommend this hotel",4,2013/04/05

It's only a 10 minute walk or a short (free) shuttle ride away from Shinjuku Station and a ton of Tokyo city action, but it feels like an oasis of calm in the midst of all of the hustle and bustle. It's a wonderful property in great condition, and it feels like a nice luxury hotel. The rooms are nicely sized (for Tokyo) and the staff is very friendly and accommodating. The meals are a bit expensive so you may not want to make it a habit to get the $36 breakfast buffet.",4,2013/04/02
1,REDACTED,en,2666,"Lost my canon rebel after a long day of travel and the concierge was able to track it down for me in 5 minutes. Knowing I didn't speak Japanese, they wrote a helpful letter for me to bring to the Lost & Found Station.

1,REDACTED,en,2667,"This was our first trip to Japan, and first impressions count. On arrival after a long flight, we were efficiently checked in on the 37th floor and given a superb room with fantastic views. Breakfast had every type of offering you could think of, and the hotel had recognised it was an anniversary trip with gifts in the room. A nice touch! Unfortunately, while exploring Tokyo on our first morning, my wife had a bad fall and injured her leg. On returning to the hotel, staff recognised that we were in trouble and litterally rushed to assist. They helped us contact our travel insurance company and proceeded to search for an English speaking doctor, which was near impossible on a Sunday afternoon. However, the hotel is perfectly situated near to a hospital and one of the concierge staff volunteered to come with us to act as an interpreter. This became essential, as few of the nursing staff or doctors spoke english, and all the forms were only in Japanese! She stayed with us way past her shift, till my wife had been seen to and we returned to the hotel. That is service! Over the next day or so she and other staff assisted in cancelling tours before our medical flight home. A great hotel is more than its rooms, its decor and location, the helpfulness, courtesy and patience of staff, when your in need, makes this hotel in my mind better than 5 stars. Special mention must be made of the help from Tomoko, Shinji & Miss Kim, all who should make their manager proud, but all the staff were fantastic. We will be back to enjoy the comfort that this hotel offers, and I fully recommend it to all.",5,2013/03/28
1,REDACTED,en,2668,"I'm rating this a great hotel for business travel. It is close, but not too close, to the Shinjuku station, which is very lively. The hotel was being renovated in March 2013. As such, there was one really nice recently renovated half and another half that had seen better days. I did not experience any inconveniences during my stay as a result of the renovations. In additional to the typical breakfast juice selections, the hotel breakfast has a fresh squeezed juice and smoothie shot bar, which is unique compared to the many other hotels that I've visited around the world. I've found firmer beds to be the norm in Japan, which is the case at this hotel as well. I believe that it is a local preference. The hotel is very convenient to the Tokyo Metro and has taxi's at the ready around the clock. I highly recommend this hotel as a business traveller.",4,2013/03/27

They provided us with shower facilities in the fitness suite and took our luggage up so we could change our clothes. When we returned from our tour we had been upgraded to a suite, so a huge bonus. The room was spacious, simply furnished but very comfortable. The enormous bed was extremely comfortable too. Breakfast was superb and service was excellent throughout. A great place to be based when in Tokyo.",5,2013/03/22
1,REDACTED,en,2673,"If arriving into Shinjuku train station, take taxi at west end exit to Hilton hotel - less than 10 mins ride about Yen 1,500. There's a free hotel shuttle to station and back at designated times.

Taxi from Hilton hotel to Shibuya is about 30 mins and costs about $2,500.

Hilton hotel Shinjuku to Narita airport - book and pay for limousine bus at hotel reception to ensure a seat. Takes about 2hrs to airport and costs Yen 3,000. Staff speaks excellent English and will give you the timetable and advise best time to depart. Rooms from 8 up to 38 (37 is executive lounge). Big hotel with heated indoor pool, 2 gyms on 5th floor, sauna and massage centre. Free wireless internet in lobby area. Had to get a taxi one morning and asked the guy at the door (in uniform), he just ignored me as he was on his mobile phone – grumpy old man! This is very rude. So I had to ask another guy. This younger guy was helpful. This is a big hotel and I have been in Japan for 3 weeks now and have found the smaller hotels much better, more personalised service where they give a damn about you. Here I am just lost amongst the many guests. The room is so far from the lifts as hotel is big. The other hotels were not only smaller but they also had free wifi in the rooms. Here you pay more and no free wifi. Check in reception staff very good though. Check in 2pm, check out 12 noon.

Room – English tea, coffee, sugar and milk provided. Conditioner also provided. Water pressure and hot water not great. No free internet in room. Toilet flushes warm water when you sit down. Buttons to play with – adjust strength of spray for front or back private parts. Nice big magnifying mirror in bathroom. Lifts do not make a sound so you need to look out for the flashing light on your floor. Very comfortable 4 pillows and bed. Bathroom small and glass panel in the way of taps but decent size bathtub.

Breakfast/lunch – on ground floor. You can choose between breakfast or lunch. Great selection of Western and Japanese choices. There’s an egg station. There’s also a healthy juice station. I chose breakfast but on departure day, I chose lunch (after checkout). Excellent lunch spread too (Western and Japanese).

Vicinity – cherry blossoms right in front of hotel and across the street, Shinjuku Central Park with a shrine at one corner. Denny’s is just to the right of hotel. Reasonable western or Japanese choices and free wifi too. Had a salmon pattie with rice, egg, avocado, salad and choice of free drink for Yen 840. Not much else around as most of the action is on other side of Shinjuku station hence location not great for the tourist, but for business it’s fine although it leaves little dinner choices and not convenient. After a long day at work, the last thing I want to do is wait for the shuttle, take the ride to find something quick and simple then have to wait for the shuttle time again to return to hotel.",3,2013/03/20
1,REDACTED,en,2674,"A great choice for a visit to Tokyo. Very good hotel as Hiltons go internationally, with nicely appointed rooms and all of the amenities and services you expect from a Hilton. Food and drinks in the hotel restaurant can be pricey (USD$10 for a latte), so be sure to consider any specials they offer you when you check in to reduce the costs of breakfast or other meals. Wifi is free in the lobby but not in the rooms. The closest subway station is the Nishi-Shinjuku station with the Marunouchi running through it - you can pretty much get anywhere from there by transferring to other lines, but keep in mind that the trains that run through this station are not JR lines, so if you buy a Japan Rail Pass, these trains aren't covered. The nearest station with a JR line is Shinjuku, but that is a pretty good walk (20-25 minutes) if you are looking to avoid the 160 yen fare to get from Nishi-Shinjuku to Shinjuku. Anyway, I included all of the details about the trains because I was most interested in access to-from this Hilton so wanted to share. Overall, it is a great hotel and I will definitely stay there again.",4,2013/03/18

1,REDACTED,en,2676,"We had a fabulous short break in Tokyo in November 2013 and stayed four nights at the Hilton Tokyo on the Executive floor. We really were treated to the best customer service and food/drink treats. We have tried a number of the Hiltons and Exec Lounge extras, but the Hilton Tokyo so far is the best. The evening appetisers were delicious, as were the cocktails and bubbly on tap. Breakfast was excellent and plenty of choice and afternoon tea snacks lovely too. We were lucky enough to have excellent morning views of Mount Fuji from the Exec Lounge which is right at the top of the hotel high above the city. Excellent shuttle bus service to/from Shinjuku if you didn't want to walk, although walking and accessibility is another plus for this hotel. Good shuttle bus to/from the airport too. Beautiful hotel, great access, and lovely people working there.",5,2013/03/17
1,REDACTED,en,2677,"This hilton is similar to many we frequent, yes, we've been to better, but overall, the initial impression was good. We were on floor 29, rooms and hallways all renovated, very contemporary...we quite liked it. The king bed with the new sheets and pillows were great, and the shower had lots of pressure even though the bathroom in general looked a bit tired. The view was also great. The lobby seemed to always be busy, but had a very sleek feel to it. Customer service was great, always conducted with a smile.

Now why did I give only a 3/5? Well, for starters, it really annoys me when no drip coffee is offered in the room. I know it's Japan, but it should be standard for the price of the room. Also, like 99% of the other guests have already stated, it's stupid to have to pay 1600 yen per night for wireless, what a scam! Also, there are no English newspapers offered, let alone left every morning under the door like others we've seen. A small annoyance was the check in lady... Many real high end hotels will address you by your professional name....so normally they would address my wife by doctor. She did not, and called her Ms even though we are married lol.

Last, my wife and I were shocked that even though there were onsens available (I've done several throughout Japan) and a lap pool specifically for laps, there was nothing available for us to share a hot tub. I'm sorry, but I was not in the mood to share a small tub with 6 other naked old men. One hot tub should be standard.

The Hilton Shinjuku also has it's location parked right next to parkland (Shinjuku Central Park).

1,REDACTED,en,2682,"We stayed in February 2012 for 3 nights. I am a Hilton Diamond member and have stayed at hundreds of Hilton hotels around the world. This one is incredibly dated. Given its high prices its simply not worth the money. The first room we had was VERY small had a very old capsule style bathroom. We were told at check-in that there were No Diamond upgrades to the exec rooms available. Upon checking on the website we found they had plenty of room! So upon complaining we were moved to an exec room floor. This room was much better (slightly bigger) had better (newer) furniture and a reasonable bathroom. But we shouldn't have had to do all this to get our entitlements.

The lounge is CRAZY at canape time and breakfast! Yuk. Don't bother

There is no option to eat the breakfast in the lobby under Diamond privileges which is a rarity in this day and age. The lounge breakfast was poor no fresh cooked eggs. :(

I wont be back and neither should you go. 

Check out the Conrad in Ginza its MUCH MUCH better",1,2013/03/11
1,REDACTED,en,2683,"I checked into the Tokyo Hilton late in the evening after a flight from Hong Kong. 
The check-in went smoothly, which was welcome.
That, however, was the highlight of my trip. (I actually kept a list!)
Yes, the rooms are large - quite large - for Tokyo or any other major city, but the hotel is stuck in the '70s. From the wallpaper to the carpeting to the lobby. This hotel screams living in the past.
The bathrooms, on the other hand, are teeny tiny, with virtually no place to put your things. The blow dryer they provide is so weak it would have taken me 3 days to dry my hair with it.
When I went out at 7am in the morning to get a cab to work, there wasn't a single person around to help me. There were a lot of people waiting for the Airport Limosine Bus, but nobody at the front door. I didn't know where the cabs were, so I asked for help. 
The hotel is far away from the business center of Tokyo, which makes it a bad choice for business. 
I found this out the hard way, as it is more than a 3,000 yen trip to the Tokyo Station area. There is a reason it is cheaper than hotels closer to the business district & to the shopping in Ginza!
So, I stopped by the concierge desk on my 2nd of 3 nights to find out whether they paid for cabs into town, as other major hotels do to win corporate business, and had to deal with someone who barely spoke English. I just gave up and left, and then she chased me in the lobby to hand me a letter. It was from the sales rep for our company, but my question is why then? Why wasn't the letter delivered to my room? What would have happened if I hadn't stopped by?
Now, let's review housekeeping: 
They didn't bother to throw out the candy wrappers that were left on the desk. Clearly these weren't meant to be saved for anything. 
They didn't bother to throw out the plastic lids they put on the glasses in the bathroom, even though the glasses had other things in them (my toothbrush in one and my make-up brushes in the other). 
They didn't bother to throw out the plastic lid they put on the glass on the mini-bar, which I used for some wine. I dropped a french fry at night, and I couldn't find it. Needless to say, I found it the next night - after housekeeping had supposedly cleaned my room (vacuum much?).
I wanted to order wine from the room service menu, and after a 20-odd minute discussion, I found that they had none of the red wines on the menu. None!
The room service bills don't separate out the embedded service charge or the tax -- which I've never, ever seen before. It is just 1 price, so the bills shows a considerably higher than what is on the menu because it includes everything without a breakdown.
I set my work wake-up calls when I checked in, so they came.
The night before I left I called down for a 3am wake-up call with a follow-up at 3:15am. 3 am came & went, and the phone didn't ring. I got 1 call at 3:10am and another at 3:30am. Good thing I had a back-up.
Checkers, which offers both food & wine buffets (not sure whether the Friday & Saturday 'seafood buffet' is worth it at 61,000 yen) says it is open until 10pm, with the last seated at 9:30pm. I waited at least 30 minutes for my food (I ordered from the a la carte menu rather than opt for the buffet, but that was still unacceptable). Then I watched as they took down the food and wine buffets starting at 9:45pm, so if you are late, you are SOL. 
(Tip: Water from the mini-bar is 310JPY, but only 200JPY at the Chequers pastry shop.)

The list:
Shower pressure: Surprisingly good for the 22nd floor.
Front desk: Check in & check out were good. If you call, you're in trouble.
Bed: Average.
Sheets/Bedding: Average.
Towels: Larger than average, but only average for softness & absorbency.
Phone service/attendants: There is a real problem with them understanding you if you speak English. 
Room size: Above average.
Room service: Aside from the fact that none of the bottles of wine were there, it is OK. It is limited as to time. Not many appetizers or sides. Based on the hotel's Chequers restaurant, which has a bigger selection.",3,2013/03/09

Pros:
• Classic 5 star property
• Excellent concierge, Excellent service
• 7 minute walk from Shinjuku station
• They define the pursuit of excellence here

Cons:
• None 

ProTips: 
• Upgrade to an Executive room and stay on the executive floor with nightly cocktail bar and fine appetizers at Happy Hour as well as Executive check-in bypassing the chaotic lobby.
• The sauna here is an exception to the usual ‘no-tattoo in Japanese saunas ‘ rule. They understand that a high number of guests from the West have tattoos and are friendly and accommodating.

This is a great hotel with highly trained and efficient staff. Expect the best here. We spent a week and a half here using it as a base to explore the city and found it to impress again and again. The service is great. The location is a short walk from Shinjuku station and if you absolutely need to dine in the options are more than palatable. This place is what you’d expect from a Hyatt property and we wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again. The experience on the executive floor was extremely pleasant. The view is amazing and on a clear day Mt. Fuji-san is clearly visible in the morning.",5,2013/02/27
1,REDACTED,en,2689,"On a trip to Tokyo, I stayed here and also a very large local brand closeby. Both get mixed reviews. The bottom-line for the Hilton is that the rooms are large (by Japanese standards), the location is good, but the property needs maintenance and I got tired of being nickle and dimed on everything.

Location: Right next to the Nishi-Shinjuku station or about a kilometer or so from the main Shinjuku station. Also right next to the Shinjuku Park (1km loop around) and the government buildings. Plenty of restaurants nearby.

Rooms: I was upgraded to the junior suite, which was nice. However, I noticed the wallpaper was peeling at the seems, the vinyl furniture was well worn (showing through in many places), and overall just needing an eye for detail from the maintenance crew. Compared to the local chain, this hotel was, however, more modern. Compared to other Hiltons around the world, this one ranks near the bottom for the quality of the property.

Price: Unfortunately, this is where things fall apart. The basic room rate gets you a room. If you want breakfast (which they push upon registration), you'll have to fork over $20+ a day. Also, if you booked here based on the great reviews for the executive lounge, be aware that you must be Gold or Platinum to gain free access. Otherwise, be prepared to pay handsomely (I was quoted $80+ a day!). Now if you want internet, guess what? You're right, yet another outrageous fee. You can, however, go down to the lobby and get 2-3 hours of free wifi down there.

Bottom line: I would only recommend staying here if you get the breakfast, lounge, and wifi bundled with a good rate. Otherwise, look at the other hotels within walking distance that are better values.",2,2013/02/25

The property in not new, but very well maintained. I found the prices in the restaurant to be exorbitant, but one can eat elsewhere if he so chooses. The gym and pool area are very nice.

1- small lobby with many crowds. Not many chars to sit freely unless you are willing to pay for drinks. 
2- I was shocked to learn how much they charged for my local ( not international calls) calls I made from my room. It did not say anywhere how much their surcharge on local calls. You won't know until you check out. Be careful.
3- they charge 10 times more for a small can of Coke Zero ( there is no Diet Coke in Japan anymore) Be careful! There is a 24 hour grocery store within 5 min walk. Get your supply there.",2,2013/02/24

The down side is the open plan area to eat in, with a draughty front door and reception area right by the eating area. Trundling trolleys going by doesn't make for enjoyable eating. Restaurtants in the hotel very expensive. Close enough to Shinjuku station for getting around Tokyo and a free bus to the station every 20 minutes was well used especially by locals who go in to reception and then go straight down into the shopping area.

Bathroom is basic but perfectly functional and comes with a Japanese squirty loo. Wifi is good. For what I pay with the bonus of the Honors points, it is very good.",4,2013/02/22
1,REDACTED,en,2695,"My husband and I stayed at the Hilton Tokyo during the first week of January, 2013. The rooms are spacious (especially compared to other Japanese hotels) with great views of the city. There is an underground tunnel connecting the Nishi Shinjuku station to the hotel; however, it's a several-block walk underground through a near-empty section of the subway. The underground connection is certainly nice, but don't expect the convenience of dashing straight onto the train or walking immediately into a busy section of the station. The Hilton has a free shuttle bus to the Shinjuku station but if you just miss the bus on the half hour, it can feel like a wait when you're anxious to get out exploring the city or waiting to get back to your room after a long day. We had an early morning departure flight and had timed out exactly how long we needed to get to the subway and to Tokyo station to catch the NEX so we were frustrated to find out that the underground connection to the subway was closed in the morning (there were no signs posted about the times and no one could really tell us what time everything opened). There's not much immediately around the hotel - the Hyatt is across the street, as is a Denny's (?!?), but after a fifteen-minute walk around the hotel we gave up looking for an interesting neighborhood and hopped the shuttle to Shinjuku. One of my pet peeves is paying for wifi - (we knew this when we booked so I can't complain too much!) but the reason I mention it is that we really relied on the internet a LOT on our Tokyo trip for subway routes, restaurants, etc., and so the daily room wifi charge added up. Overall, the Hilton met our expectations - great room with excellent service. We were aware of the ""cons"" I've mentioned above when we booked and after staying at a few hotels in Japan with very small rooms, we wanted the view and comfort that we knew Hilton could offer. However, our travel style is most suited to hotels that are steps from the subway and/or in a neighborhood that is fun to explore. We tend not to spend too much time in our actual room and eat only maybe 1-2 meals at the hotel during our trip. We have no complaints about the Tokyo Hilton (the service really was excellent), but we will probably not stay here again on our next trip to Tokyo. Our bottom line is that we're willing to stay in a smaller room and experience some language barriers during check-in if we're in a more convenient location to explore the city.",4,2013/02/15

The hotel also has a great shuttke bus every half hour that took guests to Shinyuku Station ( FREE)

1,REDACTED,en,2698,"The Hilton Shinjuku is a typical business hotel with a lot or traffic. I could not see any particular reason to give it 4 stars, so I give it 3, although it should be a 3.5. It is in a good location in Shinjuku, about 10-15 minutes to Shinjuku station. Service is okay but slow due to the large amount of customers. It is old and probably needs a little renovation. One tremendous lack of taste that I noted was that there was no complimentary water in the room. Additionally, the service at the front desk is not all that attentive.",3,2013/02/10
1,REDACTED,en,2699,"If the difference between the Mandarin Oriental and the Hilton Tokyo is a half a star there is something drastically wrong with the way things are rated. 

The overall check in process was fine until what we were told was an upgrade to a better room (because of our gold status) was actually a downgrade. We booked a king bed non-smoking and were told they had an upgrade for us on a floor with executive lounge access. We entered the room and it was -on an smoking floor - had a double bed , not a king - was cramped and extremely dated - and the bathroom was disgusting 
We called downstairs and they tried to tell us that nothing was available to switch us to that night after asking 3 times for the managers email address they then mysteriously had a room to move us to. This room isn't much better. While it has a king bed the carpet is made of cheap felt that's worn the couch is worn as well And the leatherette has a hole in it that someone tried to paint over to make it less noticeable. There are scuff marks all over the floor moulding 

and then there is the Bathroom. You can't use the shower normally because the water sprays out of the tub and floods the floor. The bathroom is so dated and grimy that its not worthy of being in even a 3 star hotel.

Then there is the minibar - coca cola is 550 yen pricey but fine.... DONT Go to the buffet and order one thinking it will be priced similarly because its not, it's a whopping 950yen. Seriously. 

Do not stay here thinking that its a 4.5 star hotel, because its not and your wasting your money.",2,2013/02/10
1,REDACTED,en,2700,"I made a stop over in Tokyo on my way to China to meet friends for a dinner in central Tokyo. Since I am a loyal HHonors Diamond member, this hotel being in the heart of Shinjuku was a natural choice. Narita Airport shuttle had a direct stop at the hotel.

The hotel is solid in most areas, e.g. room, facilities, restaurant service, etc. as many others have reviewed. So I won't repeat here. From my experience, there were 2 areas that can be improved upon:

- Check in: While there was a marked check in line/area designated for HHonors next to the general check in line, it was not in operation at the time of my check in, even though there was a long line of 5-6 parties and no staff inquired if anyone was a HHonors member.

- I had a reservation at the hotel for the airport shuttle in early morning. While the shuttle bus was by the entrance on time and the shuttle bus driver already got all passengers onto the bus, it took 10-15 mins before the hotel staff came out to exchange paperwork with the driver and confirm the passengers boarded from the hotel. The shuttle thus had a late departure. 

I would like to reiterate that the aforementioned feedback should be deemed as a tune up point, not a turn away point. The hotel is great all around. I will always go back to the hotel when I visit Tokyo.",4,2013/02/09

On arrival we requested and received an upgrade to a mini suite on the 26th floor (I would highly recommend doing this by the way). From our nicely decorated, comfortable room we had a beautiful view of the city. In the early morning hours and later that night we got the thrill of a lifetime; a rumbling sound and the feeling of the ground moving under your feet. We looked outside our window to see buildings swaying. We saw people walking around like it was just another slight inconvenience. The longest of the two earthquakes we experienced lasted about 90 seconds. Fortunately, there didn't appear to be any damage. The only slight inconvenience that we had was that the elevators were shut down for about an hour.The staff at the hotel were very calming and professional.

1,REDACTED,en,2706,"I stayed in this hotel for four days on the 21st floor. The room was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was a bit out of date, but entirely functional, and when we're talking about Japanese toilets, that includes a few buttons for bum washes, if you're interested. The service inside the hotel is excellent, very much up to five star standards. The breakfast is very good, but can be expensive (¥2,500) if it's not included.

The hotel itself is a 15 minute walk (at least) from Shinjuku Station. There is a shuttle that runs from 8:00 to 21:40. At other hours if you're in a hurry, you're taking a ¥710 cab ride to and from. As my meetings were everywhere but Shinjuku, this wasn't entirely convenient, but the costs of other major hotels outside of Shinjuku were nothing short of outrageous (starting at ¥27,000). Try to avoid booking last minute, because rates only go up from there, into the stratosphere.

I was staying for three days and am often staying hotels that are deemed 4/4.5 star. While I stayed there i stayed in a twin share room with my gf. The overall stay was dissapointing to what I was expecting and at best would give it 3.5 stars. When I checked in they did not have a non-smokers room so I was forced to stay in the smokers room level, which stunk of cigarettes. The bathroom was small and outdated, and the concierge was not particually friendly (perhaps the language barrier, I am not sure for her bad demeanour.) The lobby area only has a handful of chairs to sit on which are usually occupied, so if you want to sit and wait you have to do so in the restaurant. Furthermore if you want wifi you have to be in the lobby to have free access, if you want it in your room you have to pay for it which is poor considering at most hotels it is complimentary. On the plus side, the room had a great view over the city, the bed was very comfortable and large.

The receptionist at check-in is not sure whether Diamond members can eat the full buffet breakfast at St George's Bar and suggests I enjoy the complimentary continental breakfast in the Executive Lounge. But I keep my composure and after entering my suite dial concierge and re-ask and they profusely apologize stating of course as a Diamond Member I can enjoy breakfast in the main restaurant. Ten minutes later the chief concierge knocks on my door, bows deeply, and presents my breakfast voucher.

Luckily I held to my guns as the Executive lounge was a real mess - people everywhere, food haphazardly placed on bench-tops; after a quick Asahi Beer, I am out and to the gym.

The gym is state of the art. Excellent facilities with a tennis court, indoor pool, and über relaxing 'ofuro' Japanese bath, spa, and sauna. Heaven.

Breakfast is Hilton standard - excellent and plentiful, served by smiling, 'can-do' staff. It's always a pleasure dining at a Hilton!

According to the staff renovations are limited to 12-5pm, a bit more realistic is 9-6pm, still somewhat acceptable as long as one doesnt need/ want to rest during this time.
Besides that, the staff are lovely. F+B of good quality , prices as to be expected in Tokyo however in close vicinity are convenience shops, a 24h supermarket, starbucks and various restaurants.

1,REDACTED,en,2712,"I have been to Tokyo countless of times and had been staying in hotels in Ginza and Shinjuku districts, and I have to say my experience in Hilton Shinjuku has been rather abysmal. I don't really write reviews so one can imagine how horrible the place was to make me voice my opinion. I felt in general the staff was polite (something you expect out of Japan anyways in the first place) but not hard-working and not willing to go out of their ways to serve guests (something rather SURPRISING for me) Here are the reasons:

1) Housekeeping

Actually housekeeping was not bad, and every day the room was cleaned impeccably. However, one day the bulb in our toilet was broken, so we called hotel to fix it, and they said they'd come fix it while we went out. When we came back from dinner, we saw a card saying that ""the problem was fixed,"" but the bulb apparently was still not working. We called again and had someone come up again, this time we were able to tell them that the problem was in fact not resolved as stated on the card. The housekeeping then said they thought we mentioned the TOILET was broken....find it a little bit hard to believe that they misheard.

2) Breakfast

Servers too busy trying to clean up vacant tables than to serve dining guests, even when nobody was waiting. Also, when asked for cappuccino, regular coffee instead came. When we told them we wanted cappuccino, they answered back saying that my father had asked for coffee instead, even though my father was with us the whole time and did not say a single word. Making up excuses for themselves I smell?

3) Concierge

We had asked for the specific type of envelope from the concierge and wanted more of the same kind after an hour or so. The concierge then reluctantly said they ran out, but when she went in a check she quickly came out with a stack of them. We then asked if they have glue to help seal the envelopes, she again said there is no glue, which is very hard to believe considering it's supposedly the Hilton. She finally found a single glue stick all the way in the other end of the lobby atrium to grab us a glue stick.


4) Others

The hotel also comes with a complimentary shuttle service to the Shinjuku Railway Station, but it's very crowded usually with locals and commuters from nearby offices, and once we were actually unable to board the bus and had to take a taxi instead. The same thing happens on the other way back; we see a lot of commuters using the bus to reach the hotel, enter the hotel, then walk back out to the streets to their real destination.

Anyways, overall for the same price and class, there are bette choices out there nearby like the Keio Plaza and Hyatt Regency. I have stated at the Hyatt Regency recently and I generally find it less crowded, more exclusive, and staff there more hard working and understanding.",2,2013/01/26
1,REDACTED,en,2713,"This hotel was absolutely wonderful! All of the staff were very polite, helpful, and accommodating! Our room was very comfortable and extremely clean. The bathroom was very nice, with lots of counter space and good water pressure in the shower. We were lucky enough to be on an upper floor so we had a great view of the city. The breakfast cost extra but was delicious with lots of different options, we ended up eating too much every morning because we wanted to try all of the good food. One morning when we got to breakfast there was a line but it went quickly and all of the other mornings we arrived to breakfast earlier and there was no line. They offer free WiFi in the lobby and there are several places to sit there. You have to pay extra to get it in your room. There was one morning we were having trouble with the internet and called the front desk, almost immediately someone came up and fixed it for us. The location is excellent! You are within walking distance to lots of restaurants in the area and there is an underground tunnel that takes you directly to two train stations. There is so much to do and see in Tokyo that we didn't get a chance to use the pool or exercise room so I can't say what they were like. At the airport we were able to buy tickets for a hotel shuttle bus that took us to the hotel. Though it was possibly a little more expensive than taking a train or bus it was nice to go directly to the hotel. Through the hotel we also booked the same shuttle bus for our return ride to the airport. Also, we took several sightseeing tours with JTB Sunrise tours and they do hotel pickups at the Hilton Tokyo; that made this a very convenient hotel to stay at. We loved this hotel! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Tokyo and we will definitely be staying here again when we come back to Tokyo!",5,2013/01/26
1,REDACTED,en,2714,"A little bit a way from Shinjuku station - about a 15 min walk. You can get a subway train to very close though. It's on the quiet side of Shinjuku away from all the fun and shops. 
But the hotel was excellent, the staff really could not be more helpful and the Excecutive Lounge spoil you to pieces. Great view, great selection of drinks during the free drink time. Breakfast was outstanding - nice Sweedish musli, great fruits and lots of hot stuff. Best breakfast I've had in Japan. And they serve Champers with the breakfast - the real McCoy too - think it was Moet. 

You can take a local free bus to the hotel from the station if you have luggage. But I'd say by the time you found the bus stop and waited on a bus you would be far better with a taxi. It's not far so I would guess less than a 1000yen (£7)

The only thing i thought was a bit off was the price of drinks at the bar, possible one of the most expensive beers i have bought.",4,2013/01/20

The furniture in the bedrooms were in poor condition said king suite and we had to king single beds pushed together.
It also said free wireless but d not say it is not free in the room it is only free in the lobby for 3 hours but in the room we had to pay $20.00 Aussie dollar a night. Breakfast is quite expensive but nice and we had to pay $22.00 Aussie dollars for a 5 year old and 6 year old to eat. Service was very good the staff were awesome also. The bus they have is fantastic it comes every 20 minutes and takes you to the train station.

1,REDACTED,en,2725,Near 2 subway stations. Helpful staff! I needed an interpreter urgently and the concierge somehow arranged one for me! A bit in the middle of the business district and so not too close to any 'action'. Everything was consistent with the Hilton. Breakfast was super!,5,2013/01/18

1,REDACTED,en,2728,"A special promotion gave me two days for the price of one and I've never been more pampered in my life.

The amenities of the executive floor were almost too good to leave. Exactly what I needed!

Ok, the thing is, I visited some other true five star hotels, in totally different price ranges, and I'll admit this isn't really at the same level. I mean I with I could have had my ""Lost in Translation"" Park Hyatt experience, but that isn't something I could ever afford...

I don't know if there will ever be a promotion like the one I had; it really couldn't be beat, but it would be a nice stay even at full price.

I used their services to have baggage shuttled to another hotel, and when a bag was damaged (damage was moderate) they bag was fully replaced for me. Exactly the service I hope for when I'm pampering myself. (I stayed in August 2009, but I'm finally writing reviews)",5,2013/01/14

1,REDACTED,en,2730,"Last dec (2012) We stayed at the Hilton shinjuku for 8 glorious nights. Airport limo bus stopped at hotel so it was very convenient getting to hotel. We arrived very early and was pleasantly surprised when they gave us the keys to one of the rooms. They also managed to give us connecting rooms. The rooms were big by Tokyo's standard, very comfortable! Clean and bathroom looked like newly renovated with excellent shower system. Breakfast was part of the package and it was an excellent spread with even detox and power smoothies. My kids looked forward to breakfast every morning!!!!! Room service was great. One first night we asked for extra towel coz my little girl was sharing the room with us, and for the rest of the stay, housekeeping made sure we always had 3 towels and even 3 toothbrushes in the room.
The location was great with subway nearby tho the JR station was a little of a walk away. Nearby there is a 24 hour supermarket so getting snacks was easy and many restaurants so you will not go hungry.
One comment for room is that there was no drawers for us to unpack our clothes... So we had to live out of our luggage which was a little inconvenient since we were there for 8 nights.
All in all it was good stay!",4,2013/01/09

1,REDACTED,en,2732,"I stayed here not long after staying at the sister hotel, Conrad Tokyo, which is a different world entirely...

We stayed in a Japanese-style room at Hilton room and it was quite old and dated. We were also given a smoking room to start, despite specifically asking for non-smoking as well as it being on my HHonors profile...

Apart from being old and rather dull compared to the Conrad, our other issue here was things to a long time to happen. We waited quite a while for check-in at ground floor, eventually realised there was an upstairs check-in we could use, waited again there for quite a while (but at least with some complementary orange juice that time).

Final slowness we found hard to deal with was we had arrived here after a long trip and my young daughters needed to sleep immediately. We informed the check-in staff and requested the futons be layed out and beds made up ASAP. It took a long time for the (non-Japanese) staff to arrive to do this, at least 30 minutes, and they also took a remarkably long time to make the beds up once they arrived.

The room size was good, but based on the room age and slow service I wouldn't return here based on this stay.",3,2013/01/08

Breakfast was superb, and the hotel is well located for sightseeing. I will stay again next time I am in Tokyo.",5,2013/01/07
1,REDACTED,en,2734,"We spent a few nights over New Years at the Hilton Tokyo; the Tower Suite we booked was spacious and tastefully decorated, although the carpet was showing a bit of age and the bathroom was your basic Hilton bathroom, no extra frills. Water pressure in the shower was outstanding!

Shuttle service to Shinjuku Station was a money-saver and a life-saver, especially when everything in the immediate area of the hotel began to close for the holiday! This was a fantastic amenity and one we really appreciated!

Concierge staff was top-notch and really went out of their way to help us find local activities, make bookings and plan excursions. They are truly experts on the local area, and their guidance made our stay really incredible!

My only complaint is that we were turned away from the Executive Lounge on three different visits, due to it being full already. Once there were 15 other guests (rooms-- probably 30+ people) on a waiting list for entry. Lounge access is one of the most important benefits to me as a Hilton Diamond member, and one which I actually go out of my way to spend more money with Hilton each year to secure. So being unable to actually enjoy this benefit really disappointed me. I understand fully that lounges are not unlimited capacity, but based on my experience as well as other Trip Advisor reviews and feedback from other guests overheard on our stay, it seems like the Hilton Tokyo is in need of a larger lounge, or a smaller number of rooms that bring Executive Lounge access. It was really disappointing to visit the lounge four times and be turned away three of those times.",4,2013/01/07
1,REDACTED,en,2735,"Have just returned from two weeks in Tokyo, staying at the Hilton Tokyo. Located in Shinjuku, right next to the Nishi-Shinjuku metro station, it is very easy to access the hotel and the city. The airport limousine service stops directly at the hotel which is very helpful.

The quality of the rooms I had were good - a decent size, well furnished and immaculately clean. As an HH Diamond member I was fortunate enough to receive complimentary room upgrade, access to fitness centre and access to the executive lounge. The fitness centre is small but has a good selection of well maintained equipment. The executive lounge was located at the top of the hotel so had good views. The breakfast options and light meals accompanying evening cocktails were good. The selection of ""snacks"" during the day didn't really exist on the couple of days I dropped in. On a couple of occasions, the executive lounge was full during the pre-dinner time frame between 17:00 and 19:00, so we were turned away and had to wait to be called later when a table freed up. In my mind the executive lounge should be available when eligible users wish to use it - so either the lounge needs to be made bigger or the number of invitees should be reduced.

Service was good, with all staff I interacted with displaying a very friendly, helpful and professional image. Whilst not as ""glamorous"" as other hotel options, the Hilton offers a solid product at a reasonable price. I would happily base myself at the Hilton Shinjuku on future visits to Tokyo.",4,2013/01/06
1,REDACTED,en,2736,"On a family vacation to Niseko Japan (Hilton no doubt)the family wanted to spend a few days in Tokyo.
We wanted to be central and being a HH Diamond chose the Hilton.
I can't say enough about how helpful, professional and competent the hotel and their staff were. from allowing an early checking, to helping with directions, to making even my children feel welcome. The rooms are functional and tasteful. It's hard to find any faults on this trip.

Well done Hilton, you once again differentiate yourself.",5,2013/01/05
1,REDACTED,en,2737,"We got the limousine bus from Narita straight to the hotel which is very convenient, if a bit of a long journey. It took close to 2 hours which is a bit painful but even getting the fast train, the subway and then the hotel shuttle would have taken almost as long so there's no way round it.... except to fly into Haneda airport which is closer.

When we checked in, we were informed that they had a special deal on: breakfast and internet for ¥6,000 per day as opposed to the ¥8,200 it would normally cost. We hadn't really planned to take up the offer because we object as a matter of principle to paying for internet anywhere in this day and age but it was over the New Year period so we accepted.

We were looking forward to checking into our room as we arrived very late but what a let down. It was so dated and basic that we might as well have been in a Holiday Inn (see photos) - and it only had a Queen bed despite the fact we'd ordered a King. I phoned down and was told that they were full and that they could move us the following night. It was only when I continued to complain and object that they managed to ""find"" a room for us. 

We were moved to a higher floor, to a renovated room which was worlds apart from the original room we'd been given. I can't say it's a top of the range high tech renovation but it's certainly a massive improvement - see photos. That said, it was virtually impossible to get out of the shower and as an aside, I think it's completely objectionable to charge the same rate for rooms that haven't been renovated.

Anyway, the next morning, we went down for breakfast only to find that there was a queue of over 30 people and that we had to wait to be seated. It was frankly like a zoo and without doubt the least enjoyable breakfast I've had in a long time. There were way too many people milling around so people were bumping into each other, there were long queues at all the food stations and many of the buffet items had run out. I have to admit it was less frenetic the 2 subsequent mornings but it really was a miserable experience that first morning.

When we got our bill for easy check out, it was also wrong - they'd charged us for the special internet & breakfast deal as well as internet on top. A small error that was easily rectified but added to the list of other issues we'd already had, it just didn't sit well with us.

However, that said, to be completely fair, the hotel wasn't actually bad. It was a pretty standard chain hotel and the plus points were:

* It was in a good location (for us) as it was max a 10 minute walk from Shinjuku. 
* There is a free shuttle for those that don't want to walk from Shinkjuku.
* There's an underground walkway that links it to 2 metro stations and various other spots.
* The staff were amazing.
* There is at least free wifi in the lobby area.
* There were some good restaurants very close by in the I-Land building next door. 
* There was a grocery store less than 5 minutes walk away.
* There was a Starbucks and Denny's across the street although we didn't try either.",3,2013/01/02

The location of the hotel was great for sightseeing (Subway on door step) and a short walk we were in a shopping/entertainment district.

1,REDACTED,en,2740,"Excellent staff and service at the Hilton Tokyo. We had two rooms at this property. Both rooms were clean, had comfortable beds and nice linens. The bathroom was great with a good shower and extra toiletries. The room had a nice tv with a variety of international channels. 

There is s a charge for the Internet in the room, but free in the lobby. They have a business room off the lobby that is complimentary and has Mac computers that are maintained and efficient. 

We took the Train from the Narita airport to the Shinjuko station. The hotel has a shuttle bus that runs every 20 minutes. You need to exit the station from the WEST entrance. It is a bit confusing if you don't know the station. The shuttle bus picks up in front of the Keio department store , which is at the west exit of the station. Take bus #21. 

The Friendly Airport Express bus picks up about every hour. We took it to Narita airport when we left. It was 3000 yen per person. We thought it was easier than the train and it dropped us off at the front door of the Airport. 

We had a light dinner at the lobby restaurant the night we arrived. It was very expensive. Two medium pizzas, 5 beers and a coke was. 16,000 yen. It was not worth the money, but we were tired. Most people seemed to take the shuttle bus to the station area where there are many restaurants. Not many restaurants in the immediate area.

I don't remember his first name but I think he was Mr. Tsai who was curteous and helpful. First we got lucky and was able to check in early because our plane arrived in the morning. I asked if we are getting a room on the executive floor with lounge access but was told that they are all full that day and the only room available on that level is just a regular room. Instead, Mr. Tsai suggested that we take the junior suite which is much more spacious but without lounge access. He said if we will be out around town anyway there is really no need to use the lounge. He gave us several drink coupons (and ask for more if needed) to the bar in the lobby and also access to the free breakfast buffet the next morning. He was right! We were out all day and didn't even have a chance to use the drink coupons. The junior suite was indeed very spacious and comfortable with an excellent view. Breakfast buffet was great with plenty of choices even though it was kind of crowded.

I managed to get a good rate at this hotel though the airline that I work for.

The Hilton Tokyo is a good, centrally located hotel that has excellent, and very understanding staff. The only downside is the cost of the WiFi for the day.

The room was larger than average in Tokyo, with 2 lovely soft, comfortable beds with a choice of pillows. I had such a nice sleep here! And the toilet is the most amazing toilet (when you stay here, you'll understand!!).

There is a Tokyo Metro station directly below the hotel in the shopping mall, which is handy to get to everywhere in Tokyo.

Check out was smooth and easy, and the reception staff suggested getting the limousine bus to the airport as it would be easier with baggage. All in all, an excellent hotel in Tokyo.",4,2012/12/26
1,REDACTED,en,2745,"This is my 2nd trip and 2nd time staying at the Hilton Tokyo. This time I traveled with my infant child and they were very accommodating in that respect. They provided a crib for our entire stay which is a great help to us.

The positives: 

The Executive Lounge is one of the best. I love that it is open all day and is very helpful when I am working and my wife is at the hotel that she can go get a snack and relax. I feel the staff tried very hard to accommodate us and work around us having a baby with us. I am a Hilton Diamond member and I stay at this Hilton because of the lounge. They staff also went to great lengths to try and accommodate some foods/snacks for my wife who couldn't eat dairy.

It has a great location relative to Shinjuku. 

The executive floor rooms are fantastic and we definitely did not have any complaints with the room. Our first night we were not able to be in an executive floor room and the staff, after asking, found a way to move us onto the executive floor after the first night.

The negatives:

My child has a milk allergy right now.. which means while my wife is nursing my wife can't have milk..or milk products. We understand this can be difficult in Japan to avoid but it is possible. We did explain that she can't have milk, butter, whey, anything dairy. We even have a sign written in Japanese that says this so there shouldn't be any confusion. The staff did try very hard I felt to accommodate this. However at least 2 times she was served food that did in fact have dairy in it. Primarily margarine (which after asking..and confirming with the staff who talked to the kitchen. does have dairy in it) Also she was served a sandwich(two different times) where the bread contained dairy. As I said they did try hard but it just seems like it is such a common allergy problem that understanding that margarine that contains butter/whey..is pretty much milk. No real harm was done other than a child with a tummy ache for a few days..which isn't fun mind you. I don't know if the fault is with the serving staff not asking the right questions or cooks not understanding what dairy free means. It could of been a real problem for someone that has a more serious food allergy. But maybe people that do are more careful and ask more questions? I think we tend to think if we say no dairy that they understand and food items the staff claims are ok to consume are indeed ok.

The nice to of haves?? 

We found that the hotel did have a few activities such as Christmas hula dancers/singers in the lobby on a couple of evenings. I guess the negative part is we only knew of this as we walked out of the hotel for dinner. Something may of told us about these things in our rooms but we didn't see it. It would of been appreciated if when we checked in, knowing we would be there a week, to have something like that made known to us. 

We will still go back to this Hilton as long as the lounge is there anyway. With any luck my child would of outgrown the allergy thing and my wife can eat all those yummy things she wanted to eat but couldn't while she was there.",4,2012/12/25
1,REDACTED,en,2746,"We stayed here our first night in Tokyo, then had to move to another hotel for business. We were supposed to stay at other hotel for 7 nights, but after 3 nights, we moved back to the Hilton. It was convenient to everything, but more importantly, it was more comfortable for us because of its Western style. (We try to stay at Hilton hotels when we travel outside the U.S. and this hotel did not disappoint.) Considering our long stay in Tokyo - 10 days - this hotel was the perfect fit for us. 

The hotel is beautiful, clean, and offers all the amenities of a Hilton in a large city. The staff were very friendly and always asked if they could assist us. We used the Executive Lounge (2 rooms - the largest Exec Lounge we have ever seen), which fortunately, served Western-style food in addition to Japanese food, although their scrambled eggs were more like a curdled soup than scrambled eggs and the bacon is served almost raw. Fortunately, they also offer a large selection of fruits and cereal as alternatives. The evening fare in the Executive Lounge was hit and miss for American palates. If you plan to use the Executive Lounge, plan to go early, as this place is always packed and sometimes you will have to wait in line for a table.

All in all, this was a great place with great service.",4,2012/12/24
1,REDACTED,en,2747,"Returned again to the Tokyo Hilton in December and was not disappointed. I find this hotel to be a convenient hop from the airport on the Airport Express even though it is a bus vs a private car. It is also a short walk underground to the subway just off Shinjuku so getting around is fairly straight forward and the concierge will help with instructions, tickets and directions.

The hotel is usually quite busy so book early, I find it quite full but reasonably quiet for all the business they have. The exec lounge is a good place to work and catch up on things while traveling. On a clear day you can see the mountains and get a great sunset from there.",5,2012/12/19

The rooms are clean and the beds are very comfortable. I would recommend staying on one of the top floors, the views are AMAZING! The restaurants in the hotel are good. There is a little something for everyone. I would probably stay here again. The only downfall is the noise, between the elevator and the kids running around above me I did not get much rest. It was very very loud. Do not book through Priceline or websites of the like, they give you a crappy room. However, overall it was a good experience.",4,2012/12/14
1,REDACTED,en,2750,"The Hilton Tokyo was the first of three hotel we visited in Japan. 
The hotel is located roughly 15 min from the Shinjuku station and a free shuttle bus is departing the hotel every 20 minutes which is quite convenient.
The hotel itself is quite large, there must be hundreds of rooms and the lobby is always busy.
If you are used to Hilton hotels around the world, you won't fall from your chair, it hasn't been ""japanized"" very much and the room is fairly similar to what you would find in Sydney, Shanghai or Singapore.
As we had booked an executive room, we checked in on the 37th floor which is always nice, efficient and friendly staff up there, we were upgraded to a junior suite on the 34th floor, great views and the room itself was quite large (small bathroom though, and the usual Crabtree and Evelyn amenities were unfortunately replace by another brand).
I would strongly recommend you pay the extra few dollars for the executive floor; not only for the view but, also for the lounge itself which is very handy, comfortable and will serve you great cocktails before you head out for dinner in busy Tokyo!
The staff are really nice and don't mind going the extra mile to help you find what you want. It really was a great time.

I have only one negative comment to make but it's a BIG one, and I will not rate the hotel 5* because of that: we are in 2012, in a 5* hotel, in the middle of one of biggest cities in the world, the Queen herself is tweeting daily and they are asking us to pay ¥1500 per day for wifi in the room?? You can't be serious! You get free wifi in bloody motels on the highway these days!!

Mr Mead, I see that you are usually personally answering to all reviews on tripadvisor, please read this and do something! The result is that your lobby and executive lounge are full of iPad holders, not enjoying the great service but sending freaking emails to their boss and wives!

Walking is easy to the station too - less than 10 mins. And if you are too tired/have too much stuff from the shopping in Shinjuku, taxi is about 700/800 so it's affordable.

we stayed there with our kids who thoroughly enjoyed their time - cute balloons at the reception, thoughtful service at breakfast (one of the service staff cut up my daughter's food into smaller pieces), and the indoor pool and onsen/toiletries - looked forward to taking a public bath!

we got upgraded from 19th to 24th floor (standard to deluxe) which was really appreciated as the furnishings were updated (modern/clean contemporary style that's reflected in the website photos), and the room was spacious. I think I would have been a bit miserable if I stayed on the 19th floor as even the lift lobby seemed of an older style (peach tones/80's decor).

other tips: go to the tokyo metropolitan govt building nearby for a free panoramic view of the city or just right across is the sumitomo building where the top floors have restuarants - try 52nd floor senya restaurant for teppanyaki (great views, food and service).",5,2012/12/06

Excellent beding, good supplies in the bathroom. Very clean. Friendly staff. There is a shuttle leaving every 20 min to/from Shinjuku station. Got a breakfast/internet package for 40,000 Yen (original about 52,000 Yen). The selections for the breakfast are very good, even if you are only interested in cereals. If you want to save money, walk several blocks to the east, there are plenty of options, local stores as well as convenience stores such as 7 eleven or Family Mart. Those convenience stores are different from those in US. They provide good choices at good prices for fast food and drinks of good qualities. Can be heated at the store. This hotel is about 20-30 minute walk from Meiji Shirine. There is a small park, Shinjuku Chuo Park, close to the hotel. However, it seems to be the home for homeless people.

1,REDACTED,en,2758,"I recently spent 4 nights at this hotel. I was on an executive level floor and enjoyed my stay. The staff was fabulous which seems to be consistent with other Hilton properties in Asia (and generally better service than in the US). The room was comfortable, nice size. The breakfast, tea and happy hour in the lounge were quite nice. A variety of food to appeal to multiple cultures. 

The gym was nice, several pieces of cardio equipment and a 2nd level which wasn't obvious should the first level be full. Weights (machine and free) were also available. One nice touch was the separate stretching room. I had it to myself every time I wanted to use it. 

The hotel has a shuttle that goes to/from the Shinjuku train station 3x/hour. Definitely use this if you have luggage. As an alternatively the station is about a 10-15 min easy walk.

Both the executive lounge and lobby area have business centers with computers.",5,2012/11/24
1,REDACTED,en,2759,"I've been to Tokyo a few times and stayed at various hotels through out the amazing city. Being a Diamond member of the Hilton chain and having my business in Shinjuku, i decided to stay at the Hilton Tokyo. I arrived on a Sunday to absolutely fantastic staff! The folks that work at the Hilton Tokyo are some of the most gracious, helpful and courteous hotel staff I've had the luck of meeting world over.The breakfast buffet was really good and accommodated various different ethnicities. Having said this, the hotel itself (with exception to the lobby and the 53rd floor lounge) was rather dated. The rooms are spacious, especially from a Tokyo city perspective, however they are dated...they're not what you expect when you think of a modern Japanese hotel. They're more typical to a north American hotel room (which may be good for some folks) vs. the modern gadget filled hotel rooms you imagine and i have experienced in Tokyo.

So if you're looking from a business travelers perspective, this hotel simply meets the needs (especially if you're working in Shinjuku), but i don't believe it really gives you a full appreciation for some of the neat modern amenities that other hotels in Tokyo have to offer.",3,2012/11/22

A few examples of this was i couldn't find an ATM that would except a my credit card to get cash out, one of the staff members walked me to a machine that would work and waited while I made the transaction. Another time we left the room in mess to get out as early as we could, one of the room cleaners picked up all my daughters stuffed toys sat them up neatly ready for her to play with.

1,REDACTED,en,2768,"Stayed in Hilton Tokyo in the Shinjuku area when in town for a business trip. The hotel location is convenient in terms of access by the airport shuttle bus, as well as the Narita Express train, although the location of Narita itself makes it time consuming to go back and forth.

In terms of Tokyo it's well connected with a subway station in the basement, however, subject to location of meetings etc. it is recommended to think through Hilton's location relative to this. My business was East and South West respectively and a fair bit of time was spent commuting.

The hotel is top tier, and I will definitely stay there again. In particular the service level is top quality throughout the hotel, from the bell boys you encounter upon arrival till the reception staff upon check out.

The hotel is fairly old but seems to be recently refurbished, and the interior decoration of both common areas and rooms is state of the art, and has all the facilities.

The club lounge is an experience in itself, and highly convenient during the day for business purposes. The evening coctail and snacks session is unique in its class, and I must commend the staff for making an extra effort as well.

The gym is well equipped and convenient as such.

The onlyd drawback if anything would be the beds/ pillows; they will not get a top score but then again, that's a highly individual thing.

The hotel has everything you need at an acceptable rate in Tokyo, and I will definitely keep it as my first choice for both business and private purposes when going next.",5,2012/11/10

1,REDACTED,en,2770,"We stayed at the hotel during a very busy tourism season in Japan (fall color), and in fact this was one of the few places that had rooms available for three nights. Although typically expensive for a Hilton in a large business-focused city, I was happy to find a three night stay package price that knocked about 20% off the cost. The location was in a major business and government area, but it is convenient to get anywhere from nearby metro stops and Shinjuku station, one of the busiest and best connected train stations in the world. The hotel runs a quick shuttle bus to the station every 20 minutes, although the walk to the station is easy. There are some nice local spots to visit, most notably a fine and uncrowded city garden park (Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden). You get to the garden by crossing to the east side of the station area via the underground mall (use Google maps to see the huge mall area and the exits to the street from it). We also went to Takaosan, a mountain area attraction west of Tokyo and a quick trip on the Keio line train (be sure you take a limited express not a local!). If you are interested in sampling local food, be sure to check out the basement food vendors in the major department stores like Isetan (east side of station) and Odakyu (west side). For airport connections, a convenient bus service (Airport Limousine) comes to the hotel. Finally, I note that there are plenty of comments on TripAdvisor regarding the rather spartan rooms (we had a King Deluxe), and it is undeniable that you can get larger and more luxurious ""standard"" rooms in other Hiltons. It easy to find bad hotels in Tokyo, however, and I stayed in another business hotel there that was not much cheaper but was amazingly bad compared to this hotel. I suppose one could opt for a suite to get more space, but the point is that if you really take advantage of the locale and many sights in the area, all you really need is a comfortable bed in a clean hotel with an excellent staff, and this hotel has both,",4,2012/11/09

However, as a leisure traveller, its location is not too convenient, even though it offers free shuttle to and from Shinjuku station. Also, there is lack of sitting area in the lobby.

1,REDACTED,en,2773,"My husband (a Diamond Hilton Honors) member and I stayed here for a total of 4 nights over 2 stays, using points. We always try to stay at Hiltons on our vacations because we enjoy the perks – i.e. the Executive Lounge and the free upgrades. We used to live in Asia, and one thing that was great about Hilton hotels in Asia, is that they are so luxurious. This was certainly NOT the case here. 

There are some positives. The location was great. 2 subway lines connected to the hotel (although a bit of a walk). It’s even walkabout from Shinjuku Station (although maybe not with luggage). The shuttle to Shinjuku station was very much appreciated. And the food and drink in the Executive Lounge for cocktail hour was great. Most of the people who work there are great – they genuinely wanted to help us (with directions, dinner recommendation and reservations, etc). I read other reviews where people said that the staff were unfriendly and unhelpful – that could not have been further from the truth for us (with the exception of the lying – explained below).

However, there is so much more wrong with the hotel than right. As I said, my husband is Diamond – which is Hilton’s top bracket in their loyalty program. When we checked in for our first stay, we were upgraded to a “Deluxe” floor – not the executive floor. We knew that that the hotel was very busy, and upgrades are only offered if available, so we didn’t think too much of the smaller than usual upgrade. However, when we got to our room, we couldn’t believe how basic it was. We were wondering, “if this is a deluxe room, what is a standard room like?” To put it in perspective, a couple of weeks ago, we spent a night in the Hampton Inn in South Oklahoma City. I would put this on the same level of luxury (all the way at the bottom). I see in the manager’s response to reviews that he refers to the hotel as a five star property. I have no idea where he gets that from, but our “Deluxe” room was the equivalent of a three star room in the US. When I think 5 star – I think luxury. Now the size of the room was actually fine – I wouldn’t complain about that at all. However, the bathroom was tiny! I didn’t have room to leave any toiletries in there (my husband had room for just his). The furniture is cheap looking, cheap feeling, and there are no decorations. There is not one thing about that room that says “luxury”

After 2 nights, we left for one night, and then came back for another 2 night stay. This time, they told us that there were no King beds, and they had to put us in a Queen bed on a “Deluxe” floor. We asked to be upgraded to the executive floors (since the hotel was not full this time) and were told that they only do a 1 level upgrade. I find that so disappointing. One of the best customers that Hilton has, and they won’t even give an upgrade to the executive floor – when there is space available. Every other Hilton that we have stayed in has upgraded us as far as possible. But this so-called “5 star” Hilton doesn’t even make an attempt. So we headed to our room. It was shocking – absolutely worse than the Hampton Inn we stayed at a few weeks after this. I cannot believe that Hilton would even allow rooms like this in the Hilton brand hotels. The walls and furniture were cracked and the TV had to have been over 10 years old. I can only assume that this was a standard room and they lied about it being Deluxe. We called the front desk to complain, and they moved us to a King room that was more to the standard of our first stay. I really don’t appreciate the fact that the person who checked us in flat out lied to us about the availability of the King Bed. I also can’t believe that they thought it was OK to put us in a room like that. I feel so bad for the people without status who pay hundreds of dollars a night for a room like that – with no chance of being upgraded. We used points and still overpaid for our rooms. I’m so grateful we didn’t actually pay to stay here.

Another problem was the executive lounge. Breakfast was just not very good. Yes, I am complaining about a free breakfast, so maybe I should just stop – but we had stayed at 2 other Hiltons on our trip (Osaka and Seoul). On both those hotels, we were permitted to eat in the main restaurant (for free), which tends to have a much better selection. That wasn’t an option here. So while breakfast wasn’t terrible – it just wasn’t very good. The other problem was something that another reviewer had identified earlier, and management’s response was along the lines of “that doesn’t ever happen and won’t happen again”. Well that was wrong! We went to the lounge one evening and were told that there were no tables, and that we could return to our room and they would call us when one was available. This bothered me because another guest had made management aware of this on TripAdvisor, they knew that the hotel was full, and they did nothing to proactively address this problem. They even sat single people at tables pushed together (where they could comfortably fit more than 4 people). I was very disappointed in the poor management around this.

Overall, this hotel is very disappointing. As a diamond HH member, the benefits are nowhere near what you get at other Hiltons. This is not a luxurious hotel by any means - although according to the responses on tripadvisor, management thinks that it is (which is very worrying). I would not recommend this hotel.",2,2012/11/07
1,REDACTED,en,2774,"I stayed two nights in early October, very happy with my accomodations. As a Hilton member, I was upgraded to 35th floor, Executive Level. This allows you to eat breakfast, afternoon tea, cocktails and a light dinner, affordably. Would recommend booking these floors, even with the higher initial cost, these perks are worth it... unless you are on an expense account, then do as you please.

All employees were very courteous, requests for services such as laundry and pillows were quick and frieindly. Shuttle bus to Shinjuku station is complimentary, and quick. Recommend visiting this area to get more of a local feel... the hotel is located in a business park environment, not a lot of local flavor in the area.

1,REDACTED,en,2776,"Staying in the Tokyo Hilton in Shinjuku is always a pleasure. I stayed here for the first time nearly five years ago, and I make sure I book myself here whenever I visit Tokyo on business trips. On this last visit my company screwed up the booking and when I came to check in I found out the room had been booked for the wrong date. The receptionist was very calm, offering me a suite on the 36th floor for one night, then arranging to move my things to another room for the second night.

Staying in a suite was a real delight, witih more space than many Tokyo apartments, and access to the exclusive business lounge. Even the ""normal"" rooms are great though, with plenty of space to stretch out and all the features you would expect for the Hilton.

I also found out that staying in this Hilton is very convenient for taking buses to and from either of the two airports, and for the multitude of half- and full-day tours that the city has to offer. The concierge and ground floor staff are also very helpful, and can help you to get onto any of the available buses or trips.

The staff were attentive, courteous, polite and efficient without being overbearing. 

The only thing that i could criticise it for is £11.50 for a half of lager, yes i did say HALF. but that may not be fair as drinks prices in every establishment throughout the trip were horrendously priced. Don't that put you off, its well worth the trip.",5,2012/10/27

We couldn’t find the hotel shuttle bus from the west exit of Shinbuku station and ended up getting a taxi from the station until we got our bearings.

To get the shuttle bus you need to go up a level and go left when exiting from the station, round the corner and look for bus stop 21. {Its easy to find when you have done it once}

Check in was a painless process and people at reception spoke very good English.

We were offered a room upgrade to a deluxe room on the 32nd floor on arrival for 3000 Yen for our first stay of 1 night. We already had breakfast included in our rate. 32nd floor was a good option as it was room with a great view.

The room itself was very spacious and had a big TV, mini bar/fridge. Also very clean.
The bed was nice and comfy and provided a good sleep after our long trip.
The bathroom was very clean and had a shower over the bath. Although a general criticism of all similar arrangements; why does the shower screen never seem to stop water going onto the bathroom floor? 

Air conditioning is very quiet and the room itself was very quiet for such a large and busy hotel.

For alternative breakfast, SB is right across the road from the hotel next door to another well know American eating establishment.

The staff of this hotel all work together in serving you, the customer, the best way they can - First Class service. 
The location of the hotel is pretty much in Central Tokyo. It is easy access to the subway which is very efficient. We would take a 5 minute walk from the hotel to the Nishi Shinjuku subway station to go anywhere in Tokyo. They also have a Hilton shuttle bus to and from the hotel to Shinjuku Station. The best way to get here from Narita is by Bus - a cost of 3000 YEN ($37) each way/person. It takes about 1 1/2 to 2 hours to or from Narita. Also take in the Tokyo Government Buildings (North and South Towers) close to the hotel - it is free to go to the 45th floor and get some excellent views of Tokyo. Tourist information is also located on the bottom floor of this building. There is good shopping in and around Shinjuku station.
The restaurants in the hotel are very expensive. Perhaps if they were to lower prices slightly they would have more customers. There are lots of choices in and around the hotel especially in the Shinjuku Station area which is very modern. Recommend JoJoEn restaurant in the Odakyu Halc on the 8th floor.

1,REDACTED,en,2782,"Reviewing a Japanese hotel is always going to be difficult, due to the fantastically high levels of service you receive here compared to pretty much everywhere in the world. Trying to think of negatives is difficult as I found pretty much everything to be first class.

The only minor gripe I had was that the restaurants and bars in the hotel are shockingly expensive - although this is similar in other large hotels in the Shinjuku area. A 5 minute walk from the hotel you could find a similar restaurant or bar where the bill would be less than half the price. 

The hotel is located nearby to the Nishi-shinjuku and Tochomae stations on the Marunouchi and Oedo lines connected via underground walkways so getting around Tokyo from here is very easy. Alternatively a free shuttle bus to Shinjuku station departs outside the hotel - although to be honest it's only a short 10 minute walk anyway. 

Standard rooms are good sized for Tokyo and are clean with large comfy bed and recently refurbished bathroom. Breakfast was very nice with both Japanese and Western style buffet options (and the service was very good).

Overall I really enjoyed the stay here - and perhaps the only 2 things that 'might' put me off staying again would be the high cost of the hotel restaurants and bars (£10+ for a bottle of beer!) and the fact that it is a very 'westernised' hotel so you won't get the 'true' Japanese experience. Other than that it was excellent!",5,2012/10/24
1,REDACTED,en,2783,"My wife and I stayed only 1 night at the Hilton Tokyo, so feel free to ignore our review as it is only based on that experience.

We were recommended the hotel by our travel agent as a luxury 1 night stay before we left for Narita Airport the next day. Yes the hotel is located in Shinjuku but it is on the western skyscraper side and therefore out of the way of most of the things Shinjuku has to offer. We took the hotel shuttle bus from the train station so can't comment on how long a walk it might well be from there.

Check-in was routine and we were advised that we could have a room on a high floor which had good views. We had requested a double room but all that was left on arrival was a twin room. For 1 night we weren't too bothered so accepted anyway. The room though was very dated and while still clean and functional, was really in need of a renovation. I say this in comparison to the two other hotels we used in Japan - one a budget/boutique hotel also in Tokyo and the other a 4-5 star place in Kyoto. However, we paid a premium price for a luxury 1 night stay and the room was a disappointment in that regard.

One other problem when compared to other hotel experiences in Japan was that there was no free wi-fi or internet connection included in the room rate. Unlike the 2 other hotels we stayed in where these were included in the price, the Hilton charged over 1600 Yen per day per device! Now I don't have that much of a problem paying a bit extra for wi-fi, but considering the price of the room, in a hotel aimed at the luxury market, this extra charge was quite excessive. The other hotels we experienced on the trip also provided complimentary water bottles each day, which was very convenient and one of those little things you expect for the extra price of the room, but the Hilton charged. Now these things might seem pretty petty to some, but considering the Hilton is supposed to be a luxury hotel, the premium price we therefore paid for the room, and it's dated fittings, well I don't think it is good enough.

To summarise, even though we only had 1 night at the Hilton Tokyo, I would not recommend others stay there until the rooms are renovated, and management reconsiders the excessive internet charges and the few other minor things needed to make choosing a luxury hotel over other less expensive though perfectly nice hotels worthwhile.",2,2012/10/23

Keep in mind this is Tokyo, so two small and average twin beds is maybe typical, but the rooms are great overall, excellent shower (we were not even staying on the executive floor). The maid even properly arranged our yen coins left on the counter, lol.

As others have written, the only problem is the location to Shinjuku station. We either walked it which is doable, 10-15 min, but in Tokyo you do so much walking already that this can be a hassle. We never took the free shuttle, but a Taxi ride is roughly $10. 

There's a Denny's right across the street which is convenient for foreigners who don't want Japanese food or McDonald's all the time. 

I'd recommend this hotel because with a Hilton you know what you are getting, but there are many alternatives which may suit your likings more in Shinjuku, and other districts of Tokyo, in terms of better location and pricing. Can't go wrong though here.",5,2012/10/15
1,REDACTED,en,2788,"If your planning a trip to Tokyo look no further, this is the place to stay, wonderfully busy lobby but enough clerks to check you in fast . Nice rooms, great staff and a fabulous breakfast. Also there are some wonderful restaurant around and the one in the hotel is very good.",4,2012/10/12
1,REDACTED,en,2789,"This is a standard Hilton, getting a bit dated on some of the standard floors, but with newly decorated Executive floors.

We'd booked an Executive Floor King via Expedia. On arrival we were told they were overbooked for executive rooms - we got the impression this was a very common occurrence (probably because you get breakfast/snacks/drinks included in the Executive price, which makes it a fairly good deal vs. basic room + breakfast charge). Instead they offered us a Junior Suite on 33rd floor (34-37th floors are executive). To be fair we were very happy with the suite which was smart and newly decorated, though the bathroom and TVs were a little dated.

I'd recommend Executive floor access if you have a little extra budget - this includes: 
-breakfast buffet (choice of cooked English, Japanese, and continental (toast, large range of pastries, fruit, cereals)
- free wifi in your room
- free access to pool/ gym facilities
- all day you can help yourself to coffees / teas/ water/ juice, and there are also other slots like afternoon tea and cocktails at various other times. Even though we knew the Exec floors were overbooked, we never struggled to get a table even at breakfast. 

Location: a 5-10min walk from Shinjuku station (Hilton offer a shuttle bus but this probably takes longer than walking!), also less than 5mins from Tochomae metro station. Immediate vicinity is all highrise office blocks - a little anonymous - though these include plenty of office-worker-type restaurants/cafes which can be handy. 

Overall, we thought the hotel was good - the reception and concierge staff were helpful. The pool area is presentable but pool itself very small and overlooked by those working out in the gym.",4,2012/10/06
1,REDACTED,en,2790,"This hotel is located in what seems to be the business district of Tokyo, very quiet and almost spookily empty during the weekend but close to the municipal government building (free viewing deck on the forty-something floor!) and very hand for the underground and trains. Perfectly good check in etc, friendly staff, and an excellent and interesting room! Ask for a Japenese Suite, they're excellent! Roomy and you sleep on a futon on tatami mats. You need to leave your shoes at the door and put on a kimono and slippers to get the full effect of course! My wife and 2 sons (11 and 8) loved it, plenty of room, nice view, and lots of fun. Very good breakfast and we didn't have any queues (although we did seem to get showed to another breakfast room not quite so publically on view which I can only assume is because we looked a bit scruffy. Fair enough as the food was the same). The concierge booked us a great restaurant and we had a lovely time here.",4,2012/10/03

Our room (twin junior suite) is very nice very comfortable and a very good size. The only criticisim I would have with the room is that the bathroom is a little on the small side & given we are in Japan the tv is a little outdated but these are minor things and would not stop me from highly recommending this hotel. To anyone reading the more negative comments below I would strongly urge you to disregard them. I am very particular about the standard of hotels I stay in and this goes above and beyond my expectations.",4,2012/10/03
1,REDACTED,en,2792,"I expected the best from the Hilton Brand, but got the worst!

I am sure Conrad Hiltons vision of a comfortable hotel away from home would be shattered by this place.

This hotel is unfriendly not just in the staff but also the layout.

The lobby of the hotel is arranged so you have nowhere to sit without buying a very expensive drink.

I cant understand why when you are paying top dollar for a room they charge for WIFI at a stupid amount, for a WIFI service that is very poor!

The breakfast area is the most dangerous I have every seen with two small steps to get to the sitting area. I can see why they have arranged it like they have, to stop people who have not paid getting in, but it makes a crowed area.

The staff are not friendly and on leaving the receptionist asked if I had enjoyed my stay, when I replied no he said ""oh good to hear that"". They don't listen.

I guess Hilton are run by bean counters who have lost the customer care approach.

Wont be doing Hilton again.",1,2012/09/29
1,REDACTED,en,2793,"I stayed at the Hilton Shinjuku with my mother for 3 nights in July 2012.

Everything was so nice and clean, check in very prompt and efficient and the room was great with a lovely view and comfortable beds.

My mother & I had the delicious buffet breakfast every morning (one of the best!) and had the buffet for lunch one day aswell.

The only minor hitch was when I complained to the manager about the concierge staff giving me the wrong information about whether the Imperial Palace was open or not (i'd checked the internet first then decided to reconfirm with the concierge). They told me the wrong information so when we arrived there after walking miles to find it closed, I couldn't help but vent with front desk.
Well I was really surprised with what happened next. The manager called me and apologised and rectified the problem by offering to pay for our taxi to the Fish Market AND giving us both unlimited subway passes. 
I thought this was so kind & generous and I would definitely stay here again the next time I come to Tokyo.
When I came home after the holiday, I emailed the manager to thank him for his kindness, I mentioned that I loved the creme brulee from the buffet and then I get an email from the Head Chef with the recipe! 
What a great hotel! They really go out of their way to please their guests. 
Underneath is a subway station so really easy to get around. If you go to Tokyo - you simply must stay at the Hilton Shinjuku!",5,2012/09/29

1,REDACTED,en,2795,"The ‘Hilton’ brand has been debased by being applied to rather too many provincial mediocrities. This is a proper ‘Hilton’, as they used to be; five stars, prime location, lots of uniformed flunkies, attentive service, extortionate f&b prices, etc.. The décor & furnishings are either timeless & classic or old-fashioned, according to your point of view. The occasional slight blemish to the furniture & fittings could charitably be said to add to the patina of the hotel’s heritage but no such charity can be afforded for the dangerous missing bolt of high-tech office chair in our room which rendered the back liable to collapse at any time. My main complaint, however, is that only one comfortable chair is provided in a room that is sold for occupancy by two people; exactly where is the second person supposed to sit comfortably? I expect better of a self-proclaimed ‘luxury hotel’. 

At only thirty-eight floors this is one of the smaller buildings of Shinjuku’s sky-scraper district. The hotel is well located for visitors to Tokyo. Two underground stations on different lines (different networks, even) are close by and Shinjuku station, which is only half-a-mile away, is served by a shuttle bus every twenty minutes. This is useful if travelling via the station with luggage, but the station is such an incoherent sprawling mess (being actually half-a-dozen entirely separate stations, all operated by different companies, all on different levels and cobbled together in a remarkably inefficient manner) that visitors with luggage and/or visitors unfamiliar with the place are well advised to avoid it. Painless door-to-door transfers between the hotel and both Tokyo’s airports are provided by the oddly-named ‘Airport Limousine’ coaches.

The ‘Executive Lounge’ provides good facilities until it becomes overcrowded, especially in the evenings. This is perhaps unsurprising as the one lounge has to service no fewer than five floors of ‘Executive’ rooms. 

Diamond Hhonors members should note that this property ignores Hilton’s much-vaunted suite upgrade policy by restricting upgrades to rooms even when suites are available.",5,2012/09/25
1,REDACTED,en,2796,"Stayed here in September 2012. The hotel itself provides the usual level of standard expected of a Hilton hotel. Prompt check in and good service when required. The breakfast buffet is varied, fresh and the service received here is prompt. 
Fitness center is good and there is a pool, tennis court, sauna etc. Generally the facilities across the board are good.
The rooms are OK although a little tired in some ways. The bathroom is a little small however it is probably your stock standard hotel room size. The bed is actually excellent with nice sheets. 
TV includes local channels as well as CNN, BBC, and a couple of Fox channels. 
Internet (Wifi) was included in my room price however its around $22USD per day without which I believe is excessive these days. Really it should be free, especially in a business hotel. 
The location is good for Shinjuku with an underground tunnel direct access to 2 metro stops and walking distance to Shinjuku (10min) station itself. 
All over a very good hotel. I have also stayed at the Park Hyatt which is much better but with a matching price!",4,2012/09/24

Rooms are spaceous, clean and everything is available. As a sivler meber WiFi is free. Breakfast is a little pricy, but there is a Roayal Host on the way to the Shinjuku Station. Can only recommend this hotel.",5,2012/09/22
1,REDACTED,en,2799,"I stayed here twice.
Check in poor. Long wait. Not enough seating in reception area.

Breakfast poor quality - particularly the international breakfast - scabby bacon, German sausages and not much choice. Long queue to be seated for breakfast every day even though tables free. Lots of staff but everything took time.

Staff attitude was not great throughout the stay. I complained twice and neither time was is resolved.

Wifi in the lobby area is expensive - even if you have in-room wifi you have to pay for lobby wifi.

Rooms decent enough but bathrooms aged although not to a poor standard. 

Overall I was disappointed with this hotel on both occasions. From a service point-of-view the staff need training and I'd recommend they visit some of the cheaper hotels who appear far superior. I'd stay here again simply because I'm a gold member and would need the stays but certainly it was nowhere near the luxury I expected from
Previous stats in Asia. In my opinion the (Western) manager needs to get his finger out and sort the place out. At best it's mediocre so got the price I'd recommend people stay elsewhere.",3,2012/09/18
1,REDACTED,en,2800,"We are usually in LOVE with Hilton properties...we travel a great deal (we are actually ""Diamond"" members, so we stay in them a LOT!) but this was one stay that would have been improved with some better customer service. 
The good points - The property was lovely and had all the amenities that we could ask for. The Executive lounge was very nice and had a great view. The appetizers in the evenings were a nice touch. The room were were in at first wasn't great (very small and dated) but they had an opening a couple days after we arrived and since we are Diamond they did upgrade us (we had to push a bit too...) but the second room was lovely and had great space. It was in a good location for the Metro stations, and within walking distance of a bit of shopping. 

The not so good - from the time we arrived it seemed that much of the staff was ""put out"" by helping us. I know that the culture there is different, however it didn't seem them were terribly interested in answering our questions, or helping us figure out even easy things like what tours might be available while we were there. They have us two brochures - and seemed to only have the two...both by the same company (Gray Lines Tour Company.) I don't know if they get a portion of the proceeds or if they aren't interested in offering information on other options. The people WERE always POLITE. But not friendly or really helpful. They gave polite smiles and seemingly the bare minimum in assistance. As we have been served SO WONDERFULLY in both London and Paris in the past year, this was a great disappointment. The hotel one stays in does set the tone to some extent on the stay in that city/destination. We only had one person who was really kind and honestly seemed willing to help - and we thanked her repeatedly!! (And expressed our appreciation to the manage in hopes that he would recognize her and others would catch on too!)

If we ever go back to Tokyo - I might look into other options...but then again I might not. We do get points for staying with Hilton!",3,2012/09/18

There are no welcome amenities during yor stay and no room upgrades. In summary, not the best Hilton experience.",2,2012/09/16
1,REDACTED,en,2803,"The hotel itself is quite unremarkable. My guest room was dated, and the lobby area is miniscule and not very appealing. However, there are several really good reasons to stay here, so let me highlight them:
1) Outstanding staff. Everyone in the hotel was helpful, knowledgeable and well trained. After a 13 hour overseas flight, I was whisked off the bus, then to the front desk, and into my room in less than 5 minutes. Every question I asked was answered quickly and efficiently. Management has done a great job in keeping service here to a high level.
2) Great location. Close to the heart of Shinjuku, it's a 10 minute walk. Getting here from the airport is a breeze, with the Airport bus for about $30. It's a 90 minute ride and drops you at the door.
3) Good gym. The gym here is much better equipped than most hotels in Tokyo. You should be able to get a top notch workout on the good assortment of equipment.
4) Impeccably Clean. My room was spotless.
5) Good selection of restaurants close by. You don't need to break the bank eating out in this area.
Overall, I found this hotel comfortable and easy to get around in. I do understand they will be renovating soon, so hopefully it will get the aesthetic updates it really needs. I will look forward to staying here next time.",4,2012/09/15
1,REDACTED,en,2804,"I decided to book Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku by reading reviews from tripadvisor.com. So, to thank you all the reviewers and tripadvisor.com, I am helping to review my recent, super fantastic stay at Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku! :)

My family and I stayed at the Hilton Shinjuku Tokyo for 5 days, 4 nights during the first week of September 2012. The service was awesome from the start! Even though our plane arrived extremely early in the morning at Narita Airport, so we got to Hilton some time before 9 am--front desk staff was very welcoming and offered a super early check-in. Well, we paid some additions for a room upgrade, but the room was available immediately! We were also upgraded from originally 32nd to 37th floor, from a total of 38 floors. That was cool because the executive lounge was right on the 37th floor! We also received a complimentary box of Hilton chocolates less than an hour after we got into our room! That was so nice! Thank YOU!!!!!

The executive lounge is awesome! The lounge offers refreshments and snacks all day. You can expect to have a full breakfast and dinner at the lounge, no extra charge for guests staying in the executive room. Staff at the lounge were very friendly and helpful. Love the chocolate drink... a lot! I think I had over 10 glasses in 5 days!! Thanks! ^-^ 

My birthday happened to fall on that week. In the evening of my birthday, I was surprised to see a thoughtful birthday greeting with a complimentary chocolate truffle cake in my room when I got back from shopping! It was from one of the Hilton staff. He just made my birthday even more special! I hope he got my thank you gift though. I asked someone to give it to him. :) 

The room was quiet, barely heard any noise through the door or the wall. Everything was clean and tidy. Housekeeping staff were friendly and dedicated to their work. Oh, but you need to inform the hotel though if you want your bed sheets changed. It is the environmental friendly approach by the hotel to save water, but if you inform them, they will do it right away! The beautiful origami birds placed after bed turndown service were very nice touch!

Although the hotel is not located exactly in the middle of Shinjuku busy streets, they offer shuttle bus service leaving the hotel three times every hour to Shinjuku Station, where you can take JR trains, Keio trains, etc. Very convenient. Unbelievably punctual! The bus capacity is over 40 passengers a trip. There were always available seats, all the time. 

Make sure you make all your necessary requests before checking in, and you will pretty much get everything! Really! Oh, our trip got postponed by a day, so I contacted Hilton Tokyo through their Japanese website, with google auto-translate, for a slight change of stay dates. It took them only couple days to change it and emailed me back, while all my requests remained the same. So, I did not have to redo all my bookings. That was fantastic!

Leaving the hotel was also very convenient. You can buy airport limousine bus ticket from front desk or executive lounge staff. The ticket costs Yen 3,000 per person, exactly the same price as buying from their office at Narita Airport. The airport limousine bus picks you up from the front gate of the Hilton and drop you off at your airport terminal. Hilton bellboys helped us with our luggages. They ensured the proper baggage loading and everything. Oh, a complimentary bottle of water was offered by Hilton to every limousine bus passenger before hopping onto the bus. How thoughtful!

Thanks a lot ++++++ to Hilton and Hilton staff for making this trip one of the nicest vacations ever! It is definitely in the top 3 for me! I won't have any second thought about where to stay if I'll ever get to go back to Tokyo again! It's definitely Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku! <3 <3",5,2012/09/14

The hotel has a range of restaurants on the 2nd floor: one Japanese, one buffet style, one Chinese, one French. All very expensive, so only use as a last resort. The breakfast buffet is very good - a full range of Western and Asian dishes.

The best thing about the hotel is the staff - all friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. They help to make an otherwise average business hotel a little bit special.",3,2012/09/11
1,REDACTED,en,2807,"The hotel is fine. I have stayed all over Japan. The rooms were nice enough, the service was good. The staff was friendly and attentive. That covers the basics.

However, the ridiculous internet fees drove me to distraction. Internet access costs $20 a day for starters. Ok, that is common all over the world- irritating, but common. Let's not forget that we all pay $30 A MONTH at home for the internet. $20 a day is $600 a month. So, we are getting nicked when we pay 20x a home based fee to use a hotel's internet. Think about it.

All that would still be standard at the Hilton Tokyo if that was the extent of their internet fees and I wouldn't say anything. But, alas, that's not all, if you want to use a second device you can pay the $20 AGAIN. That would be $40 a day for internet folks if you have more than one device (who doesn’t?). How about that? I travel with my laptop which is essential for business and my Ipad to read the paper, catch up on the world at home, etc.

Hilton folks- I am 6,000 miles from home and the Ipad is a nice way to read the paper and connect while being away. But, NO I am not going to pay $100 for five days use of the Ipad and another $100 for the laptop. So, while I stayed at your hotel, I just had to skip the leisurely paper reading part of my morning. Thanks. And, no, there is no free internet connection in the lobby, there is a charge for that too- $10 for 30 minutes if you are so inclined. Here’s a thought; I paid your $20 a day for internet access, so in my book, at that already hyper inflated price, I should be able to use the service I paid for regardless of what I want to connect with.

As I see it the Hilton Tokyo internet policy is simply about gouging people. And, I don’t like it. Yes, I can afford $100 extra to read the paper. But, no I am not going to pay it. So, that issue clouded my entire experience at the Hilton Tokyo where I will not be returning.

Hilton management, you can skip the standard response to my post, “glad you liked everything else, etc, etc.” Instead, if you want to actually do something about my complaint, talk to the powers that be in your organization and take a stand against your ridiculous internet fees.",3,2012/09/09

1,REDACTED,en,2809,"This was my first time in Tokyo and the Tokyo Hilton was an amazing introduction to the highly efficient, professional and polite way that the Japanese do business. The hotel was clean and what you would expect from Hilton. The concierge and hotel staff all speak English. The elevators show you which elevator is coming first - a nice touch. There are no chimes on the floors with sleeping quarters. The rooms all have the toilets with bidet attached, very common in Japan. I think I had a standard room and it came with nice amenities including toothbrush, razor, comb and the others you would expect. The lights are very logical and easy to use so you always have lights in the right place. There were two complimentary bottles of water, refreshed each day. The sun is so bright in Tokyo and the shades are very nice letting in natural light but blocking the heat and then having a layer to block all the light at night. 

The Breakfast buffet was divine. Western and Japanese cuisine in the buffet. And if you get the buffet, espresso drinks are included. The service is great. Otherwise, the restaurants in the hotel proper are VERY expensive. 

There is a complimentary hotel shuttle to the Shinjuku station. The hotel is in the heart of the business district. There is a small shopping and dining area, Hiltopia, in the basement. There is a fabulous and reasonably priced, not cheap, Indian restaurant, Ashoka that is very convenient and just downstairs.

Concierge was very helpful, shuttle bus to and from Shinjuku station really helpful and runs both ways every 20 mins. Great location for getting around Tokyo. Subway is easy to navigate.

Shinjuki is the heart of the city of Tokyo- fabulous shopping (a huge Yodabashi Camera, 109 Department store, Tokyu Hands, Takashimaya and more), restaurants (a KFC and McDonald's if your kids are looking for a taste of home), karaoke, theaters are so very close to the hotel. Harajuku, Omotesande Dori, and the Meiji Shrine are just 2 train stops away!

The bathroom was small and a little dated but very clean with nice amenities from Crabtree & Evelyn. A bathrobe and slippers are also provided. Wifi worked well throughout the hotel.

I was traveling with a team of coworkers and we had the breakfast buffet every morning. With many different dietary requirements across the team, the breakfast buffet was the one meal of the day where everyone could find something they liked. The buffet has American, European, and Asian breakfast items and it was great to choose between familiar items as well as trying new things.

in terms of facility the hotel provides all the services a frequent traveller asks for (gym, pool, fast internet, laundry service...), i missed a real SPA area though. however it's a good Hilton standard facility.

breakfast was very good, but it had mainly western food which was a bit of a pitty. i experienced the breakfast area to be noisy so I appreciated the executive lounge access. might have been a temporary issue though...

to sum it up: for someone who knows Hilton hotels well and doesn't want to experiment go for it. for people who like to add the cultural touch should go for a Ryokan",4,2012/08/18

I booked an Executive room, and it was worth the additional cost. The daily buffet breakfast and evening cocktails/light snacks were delicious. Not to mention the executive lounge, which offers a breathtaking view of the Shijuku. Even though I dined alone, I never felt uncomfortable. I found the hotel staff- from the front desk to housekeeping- to be warm, attentive and very professional. All in all, this was a great hotel in a perfectly convenient location. I'll be back ! !",5,2012/08/16
1,REDACTED,en,2820,"My husband and I decided if we were going to visit Tokyo, we wanted to do it in style and booked a King executive room for four nights. Large lovely room with pillows I want to take home with me and everything thoughtfully provided. However, the highlight was opening those sliding window covers and swooning over the view of Tokyo that goes on forever. Night or day, I would never get tired of that view. Staying on a high floor provides that sweeping vista view you want in such a large city. The Club/Executive lounge is fantastic and we loved visiting the Lounge for breakfast (the Bircher muesli is the BEST), cocktails (heads up- bartender makes a mean margherita and delightful mojito) with food (our dinner it was so good) or mid afternoon when all we wanted was an icy cold drink and comfy seat. Hands down, best staff and I wish 
I knew their names; but rest assured they are all brilliant. Book it and you won't regret it!",5,2012/08/15
1,REDACTED,en,2821,"Stayed here for 5 nghts with my wife and son. Had booked two rooms and was as a Hilton Gold upgraded to EF. Much appreciated! No free breakfast in the restaurant, I guess that was because of the two room upgrade to EF. Rooms were adequate in size, very clean, free internet, with interesting view and quiet. The executive lounge is a big plus: tasty breakfast,high quality pastry, snacks (light meal) and drinks. Of the four Japanese Hiltons we stayed at this was by a small margin the best.
The first nights the internet was real slow, but after an upgrade it became pretty fast.
Location is convenient. We did use the shuttle on a few occasions, but the walk to Shinjuku station was an easy one.
The airport bus to Narita is very convenient.
When back in Tokyo we will certainly return.",5,2012/08/11
1,REDACTED,en,2822,"We stayed there in late June for 5 days. We chose Hilton as it said it was 5-mins from the metro. However its quite far from Shinjuku central district (JR) and it takes at least 15 mins walking distance. Would definitely recommend for business, but for families/couples/friends I suggest somewhere closer to Shinjuku central, where all the shops and restaurants are. Although the facilities are quite aged, the rooms are more spacious than most hotels in Tokyo so there is always give-and-take.",4,2012/08/11
1,REDACTED,en,2823,"I stayed one night at the concierge level at this hotel. The hotel is large though the room was smaller than other Hiltons Ive been too for that category (it is Tokyo of course). The last renovation was probably around 2007 and its beginning to show some wear and tear in the room which was still more than comfortable however. 
The executive lounge, should you have access to it, was excellent, a great spread for night drinks and food, and good breakfast. 
The gym is cramped and was full, the equipment has been updated though I feel the gym for a large hotel like that should be twice the size it is. It also smells a bit too much like the pool which is right next to the fitness center.
The hotel offers a shuttle bus much of the day to Shinjuku which is a good option if you want to avoid the 15 minute walk or so in the Tokyo summer. 
I would not hesitate to stay here again.",4,2012/08/08
1,REDACTED,en,2824,"We have stayed here before and really enjoyed it ,so it was an easy choice to come back again.But this time it was even better.We arrived very early after an eleven hour flight expecting to leave our luggage and go out sightseeing but we were shown straight to our room.What a pleasant surprise instead of being told to return at three.The service in the Hilton is impeccable making you feel very pampered. It is next to a metro station, Nishi Shinjuku on the Marunouchi line and there is also a free shuttle that runs to Shinjuku station every twenty minutes. If you are arriving at Narita you can get on the Narita express and then get the shuttle at Shinjuku station west exit. We also bought 'Special 2 day open ticket' at Narita airport for the metro.These were 980 yen each and you can buy as many as you need. They can only be used on the Tokyo metro but made it very easy to get around. Meals at the Hilton are expensive but they had a special offer on for breakfast and that made it good value. There is such a good choice for everyone and the food was beautiful. We had booked a basic room but there was plenty of space even though we had an extra bed and every thing was kept spotless by housekeeping. Housekeeping left bottles of complimentary water every day. Try it and you won't want to go anywhere else.",5,2012/08/06
1,REDACTED,en,2825,"We arrived late evening at the hotel to find that we had to stay in a smoking room but that it had been deodourised. Although we were staying on the executive floor so had breakfast included, we were offered free breakfast downstairs instead as compensation where it was freshly cooked and a huge choice. This would normally have been $50 per head and turned out to be the better option.Checkin was quick, checkout was a different matter as they were busy but a staff member chatted with the people in the queue keeping everyone happy.
Rooms were spacious and the internet fast.
The executive club was fantastic, the best we have been in. Seemingly like one big happy family. We made many acquaintances there and were sad to see people moving on. Afternoon tea there was good, but could have done with some savoury nibbles rather than all sweet ones. Evening drinks and canapes were a revelation. A fantastic, different selection every night and it just kept coming. 
Eating in the hotel is very expensive but we had no choice on our wedding anniversary night as a typhoon was blowing through but it is Tokyo after all.
The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to Shinjuku station and although only being a ten - fifteen minute walk was very welcome after a day of shopping.
Al in all an excellent experience and the staff were probably the best we have come across.",5,2012/08/05
1,REDACTED,en,2826,"We arrived late at night at the Hilton Shinjuku to be informed that there were no non smoking rooms and they had deodorised a smoking room for us. Due to that, we were offered free breakfast downstairs. Although we had breakfast on the executive floor this was a better option, freshly cooked and would have been $50 per head if purchased.
The room was clean and spacious and the internet connection fast. 
Executive floor afternoon tea was good, though perhaps some savoury snacks would have been nice as not everybody has a sweet tooth.
The evening canapes in the executive club were a revelation. A different freshly cooked selection each evening and although it was our first time here it felt like one big happy family. We made many acquaintances who enjoyed a good laugh. Overall, by far the best executive lounge we have been in.
There is a shuttle bus that takes you to Shinjuku station but it is only a ten minute walk anyway but is appreciated if you have had a heavy days shopping!
Eating in the hotel is expensive, we had no choice one night when a typhoon blew through but then it is Tokyo.
Overall a very satisfying experience and probably the best staff overall we have encountered in a hotel.",5,2012/08/05
1,REDACTED,en,2827,"I am in the airline industry and decided to spend my most resent vacation in Tokyo. The staff was very accommodating , kind, and courteous . The rate was fantastic considering we stayed in a ""king deluxe"" room. The breakfast buffet was always delicious . 

The hotels proximity to the subway made daily excursions drama free. I do recommend purchasing the day pass for 1000 yen, you can hop on and off the train all day. 

Thanks to everyone one for making my first stay in Tokyo a memorable one.",4,2012/08/05
1,REDACTED,en,2828,"We stayed here on our last night in Tokyo and thus had experienced a wide range of hotels in Japan. What struck me most is how western it was, busy, a lot less human touch than many if the other hotels. Check was efficient though they forgot our breakfast vouchers which we had to sort out the next morning during breakfast. Felt like we were back in New York! That's no to say it was bad, it's a really good hotel, good clean modern rooms. Great facilities and excellent breakfast as expected from a Hilton. If you are staying on business you can't go wrong, if on holiday you might want to think twice, do you really want to experience Japan then if so try some of the other hotels. If we had stayed in this hotel at the beginning of our trip to Japan I am sure we would not have loved Japan as much as we do today. The hotel is well positioned for business and the concierge helped with many a small thing for us. Tube is close though expect 5 minute walk. Caught the bus back to the airport from the hotel which did simplify things. If I return to Tokyo for business this is where I would stay, on holiday nope there are better options that give you that lovely indescribable Japanse warm feeling.",4,2012/08/05
1,REDACTED,en,2829,"The Hilton was an okay hotel, but nothing too special. 
When I went there, we had booked a supreme room. I was quite disappointed- I thought the rooms were a bit bare and the bathroom was small. (Women--beware!) The room itself was an okay size-- but more alike to a Standard room.
The staff were alright. 
Breakfast was European-styled, but it remained the same for the three days we stayed there. Bit boring, and not much variety. 
I would give it maybe a 7.5/10 :)",4,2012/07/31
1,REDACTED,en,2830,"We have recently stayed in another Hilton Hotel in Japan and that made us realised how good Hilton Tokyo had been. We haven't written a reveiw right after our last stay but I guess I have to come back and give the praises again. 

We have stayed in the Hilton Tokyo for a couple of times and every time, their service delighted us as always. The staff, particularly at the Executive Lounge, had been so helpful and polite. They can help you with all sorts of questions and will not send you away until everything is resolved. Even sometimes we noticed that they were really busy, they still manage to put up their smile and professionalism for every visitor. 

We like this modern Hilton Hotel at the heart of Shinjuku and will come back again soon.",5,2012/07/30
1,REDACTED,en,2831,I have stayed this hotel couple of times when at Tokyo for business. Hotel is very nice and rooms are comfortable. Service is excellent and I like the Hilton breakfast. Tried both membership lounge as well as normal restaurants which are both very good wit nice breakfast selection. Location is good with easy access to Shinjuku station. There is free shuttle to station every 20mins or so. For airport (Narita) hotel is easy to accessed via bus which stops right at the hotel.,5,2012/07/27
1,REDACTED,en,2832,"Although it was 12 years ago, and no doubt the hotel would have had one or two up-grades since then, the Shinjuku Hilton is a ""class act"", as you would expect. Located in the nerve centre of Shinjuku, one of Tokyo's most intense districts, which features ""the busiest train station in the world"" (!), the Shinjuku Hilton was my home for 26 weeks. The class of room that I had was not ""large"" but it was adequate. Visitors to Japan need to understand that the concept of ""space"" is different in Japan than in the western world. However, my room was, of course, comfortable, quiet, and secure.

And so, everything at the Hilton runs in ""perfect"" mode. Everything (as per in Japan generally) runs according to ""system"". Which means.... everything gets done right, but it means that things can ""feel"" a bit sterile and robotic. Which is what happens when living in a 5 star hotel for a sustained period of time, often.

As an employee of the hotel (I was working there, at that time, as an entertainer) it happened that I had some problems that required me to take a week off. Normally this would be unthinkable. But because the GM was such a nice guy, a decent guy, and had faith and good-will invested in me, a large problem was reduced to ""no problem"" and we sorted things out easily. Moral of the story: it's always down to the people, or ""the person"" you happen to be dealing with. 

Summing up, my experience at the Tokyo Hilton in Shinjuku was 10 out of 10.",4,2012/07/26
1,REDACTED,en,2833,"I stayed at this hotel several times for both work and pleasure. The staff is so welcoming and friendly! If you are a Hilton gold or diamond member, be prepared to be treated great! Since it is a very large hotel we have always been upgraded to a beautiful room and best of all is the executive lounge. It has great snacks all day, beverages all day, and in the evening the serve free appetizers and drinks. You have a fantastic view of Tokyo since it is at the top of the building. The rooms have been upgraded (I have stayed in the old rooms too which were very dated. The new ones are high tech and modern. I can't wait to go back!",5,2012/07/23
1,REDACTED,en,2834,"My family stayed in Hilton Tokyo for 4 days. Could not have expected any better. A surprised comfortability around every corners of the hotel. The staffs were well mannered and properly equipped with decent English communication skills. As a gold member, complimentary breakfast is included. The eggs were good. No doubt about the food In the morning that was good, but also the smoothies that were served and brought upon to every single table. It enables every guest with easy shuttle bus services.",5,2012/07/21
1,REDACTED,en,2835,We stayed 4 nights at the Hilton Tokyo and could not have asked for a better stay. The staff were very helpful to assist us with train connections on some tours and our room was very comfortable. We stayed there on our way home from a 4 week tour of Europe and enjoyed being able to relax and reset the body clocks before returning to Australia. It is close to the large train and bus station and there is a bus that connects you to the airport and a free shuttle bus to Shinjuku station or within 15 mins. walking. Shinjuku has everything and more for a good touch of Japanese life. Breakfast buffet has the best selection of food you could ever ask for - we really did not need lunch after this.,5,2012/07/20
1,REDACTED,en,2836,"As a regular visitor to Tokyo and a great advocate for this hotel I continue to be impressed with the quality of service being provided by the excellent staff at all levels within the hotel.
The focus on staff training is very apparent and is clearly adding to the guest experience when staying at this property. 
I would also recommend the value provided by upgrading to executive level of accommodation as the lounge facility and the extra food and beverage is great value .
The other bonus is the proximity to major train stations and department stores. A pleasant 10 minute walk .
So when in Tokyo enjoy the experience of the Hilton Shinjuku You won't be disappointed",5,2012/07/19
1,REDACTED,en,2837,"It may seem far from the sprawling Shinjuku station, since they offer shuttle service to and from the hotel, but we found if we missed the shuttle, it was a 15 minute walk, so not too bad. Also, easy to get to Harajuku and Mieiji-Jingumae from the hotel. The Asakusa shrine was subway ride across Tokyo, though. The rooms were very clean and had modified Japanese toilet/bidet combos. Very minimalist in style with shoji screens for the window rather than sheer curtains, which I thought was a nice Japanese touch. Very good executive lounge with nice breakfast and an excellent cocktail hours (2 hours actually) with free cocktails and nice hors d'oerves. Excellent gym and nice area with walking distance to many good restaurants.",4,2012/07/19

Firstly there appears to be so many of them - someone welcomes you in traditional dress on the driveway, another smiling member of staff opens the electronic doors for you, bowing and welcoming you (and that's even before you get to the front desk) Breakfast buffet one of best ever experienced anywhere - take your pick of cuisine types available and of course with efficient smiling staff. Coffee reasonable but not great. Barman one of best in Tokyo - recently win major comp - stat for a cocktail and live entertainment. wifi not so reliable but Manager assures will be rectified by September. Gym change rooms feature hot and cold bath. A must!

The staff could not have been more helpful checking in, and the concierge staff worked diligently to help me with a lost JR Rail pass. As a Diamond member, I was upgraded to the Executive Floor, with my room being a few rooms down from the lounge. My room was surprisingly large for Tokyo, with a firm but comfortable bed, a great view of Tokyo on the 37th floor, and good climate controls. The lounge was wonderful with a nice variety of food and drinks. The staff was fantastic. I wish my stay would have been longer than 2 nights, and I'll certainly return.",5,2012/07/17

1,REDACTED,en,2846,"Stayed at the Hilton for 4 nights at the end of Feb, then back again for 1 night before leaving Tokyo.

I'd love to just ramble on about everything we did in Japan here but will try and keep this as specific to the hotel as possible :)

Context - first time Australian visitors to Japan, 27/25yo, brief trip to Hakuba in between stays at the Hilton. Haven't stayed at a Hilton before. 

Impetus for the trip was to see my first UFC, and wanted things to be as hassle free as possible so happy to spend that bit extra to stay somewhere that seemed like a pretty safe bet, according to most of the reviews here.

From the moment we walked into the hotel lobby I knew I was going to enjoy my stay - there were a handful of UFC fighters hanging around the bar (turns out the whole UFC organisation was staying there the same time as were). Made for a fantastic atmosphere in the hotel the whole time we were there.

Getting There---------------------------
- Easy. We caught the Narita Express straight into Shinjuku, then got a taxi to the hotel (not yet having our bearings, knowing where the shuttle bus stop was or how easy it is to just get to Nishi Shinjuku station under the hotel),

Location----------------------------------
- Fantastic!
- Nishi-Shinjuku station is underneath the hotel (+ short walk), we tended to use this far more often than using the hotel shuttle bus to get into Shinjuku (which is also an excellent service). A 160Y ticket will get you into Shinjuku we could use our JR pass to get most places from there.
- Heaps of places to eat all around the hotel. There's a good volume of Western style restaurants right near the hotel (Dennys, Royal Host) for those in need of something more semi-familiar.
- There's a 7-11 a short walk away so very handy if you just want to grab some food to have a quick breakfast in the hotel room before heading out for the day. Also has ATM, though it didn't like my card!

The Room--------------------------
- Stayed in a standard room - great, no complaints at all, good size, nice view.
- On our last 1 night stay we got upgraded for free. Upgraded room is really just the same room, slightly better furniture, and on a higher floor.

The Staff---------------------------
- Very friendly, very helpful (aka Japanese). All spoke English.

The Food
- We didn't eat at the hotel. Checked out the menu's, a little pricey (the Japanese and French restaurants in particular). Plenty of other places to eat.

Shopping----------------------------
- We didn't shop at any places around the hotel. There's a bunch of shops underneath the hotel but we'd only pass by them in the early morning and late at night so were always closed.

Other Amenities----------------------------
- Sorry not much help here, didn't use the spa/gym etc.
- Wifi to the rooms is pretty pricey, we just used the desktops in the lobby a couple of times (also v pricey). Free wifi at Denny's next door though limited to socmed.

I'd like to think for my next visit to Japan that now being much more comfortable with Tokyo I'd be able to find somewhere cheaper, but I'll probably be back to the Hilton, it really is an excellent spot.

Also, have to say - great smelling lobby.",5,2012/07/08
1,REDACTED,en,2847,"Spent 5 nights here - arrived on British Airways from London Heathrow into Tokyo Haneda and took the convenient shuttle bus tot he Hilton. The location of the hotel is good - near Shinjuku station. There is a small underground station next to the hotel - very convenient.
I had to wait some time to check in (several hours as the Hotel was full the previous evening -despite requesting an early check in- this was the only negative)
The room was clean, fresh, well decorated and had fantastic views. The gym and Spa are good - although the swimming pool a bit small.
The food fantastic ! I will be back next trip - let's hope I can get an early check in",4,2012/07/07
1,REDACTED,en,2848,"Probably 4.5 stars is about right, with $500/night needed for the 5 star places, this was the sensible choice for us. Great executive floor lounge, but so popular with Hilton elites it had a waiting list on Saturday night. The Shinjuku location was very convenient - ride the shuttle bus (every 20 min) to Shinjuku station and ride the JR trains where you want to go. We only used taxi or subway one time each. Hint take the ""airport limousine"" from Narita to get dropped at the door - you don't want to take the Narita Express then haul luggage through the large, busy train station at Shinjuku. The staff spoke English well and gave very good service.",4,2012/07/05
1,REDACTED,en,2849,"The reason this hotel is value for money is due to its close proximity to the Subway station of Shinjuku. This hotel gives a feel of High Rise city for which Tokyo is well known.

The rooms are adequately sized & also retains typical Japanese house feel with sliding wooden window shades giving the feel. Rooms have Hot water kettle, bath robe, slippers which are good for a business & leisure traveller.

For an Indian traveler whether be business or leisure, Indian Food is a must atleast once a day. So this hotel is ideal as it is situated next to I-Land Commerical complex. On the lower level there is an authentic Indian Restaurant - Maharaja Shinjuku. This hotel serves set meal for lunch at a very decent price. Food is awesome.

Hotel too has a variety of F&B outlet which serves multi cusine. Breakfast spread is good with a combination of International & Japanese items. Best thing of this hotel is they have a limited menu breakfast for travellers who check out early morning.

Front office staff are very polite & very good. I had checked in late at night, but the staff was very pleasant & completed the formalities very quickly. Early morning the checkouts are in big numbers as it is more of a business hotel, so advise is to settle the bill previous night itself.

Hotel offers ample parking & also has shuttle bus stop for airport coaches to Narita / Haneda.

Shopping is not that great in this area, but there is a big electronic shop next to the Shinjuku subway station.

Overall, good bet for an Indian Traveller.",4,2012/07/04
1,REDACTED,en,2850,"To set the context, this is my first trip to Japan though I have vacationed in many countries. I also do not speak any Japanese. I checked in to the Hilton after staying two nights in Asakusa. First, the location is central and is proximal to a subway station on the metro line (two blocks). There is a supermarket about two blocks away. The modern looking Tokyo Metro Government building is two blocks away and is notable for being designed by renowned architect Kenzo Tange; also, you can go up to two observatory areas (no charge) in the building and get a wonderful view of Tokyo (there are free english speaking guides there). There is also a complimentary shuttle bus that runs three times a hour from the hotel to Shinjuku station which is a main subway station. There are also many department stores and food options in this subway/train area. I did not try the breakfast buffet but it looked good.

What sets this property apart from the others is the service. I have used the concierge service in many hotels on vacations. 

I was able to communcate with the concierge desk while still in the US once I established contact by phone (email didn't work for intial contact, not sure why). They were super helpful in helping me purchase sumo tickets in Nagoya. I was not able to purchase the tickets from the US despite using google translate and did not want to use the two internet based services which I found online because I had to pay in advance to private individuals-I felt more comfortable having a hotel do this and the commission was nominal especially compared to the internet based companies.

I rarely use superlatives, but I had truly outstanding service from the concierge desk run by Ms. Natsuko Fujiwara. I was trying to climb Mt. Fuji (and did it!) with two kids and could not have done it without their help. Two staff members, Tomoko Aoiki and Maya Kohhara in particular went above and beyond to help me. As i was trying to climb the first day of the official climbing season, there was still lots of snow on the trail and it was not certain whether people would be allowed to climb. Needless to say, this was a big worry for me as it was the most anticipated part of my trip which had required weeks of preparation back home. They helped me closely monitor the weather conditions, book the bus reservations to Mt Fuji, and asked about making hut reservations, and so much more and for not just the climb but also for my entire stay. The coordination between the staff was excellent. It's hard for me to describe this adequately in words, but I felt really well taken care of and was sad when I had to leave for Kyoto. I was highly appreciative of the care and consideration I received and impressed with the concerige desk's competence and thoroughness. My experience at the Hilton has made my trip special and memorable and set a new bar when it comes to service.",5,2012/07/02
1,REDACTED,en,2851,"Had a very wonderful stay 24-30 June 2012. Conveniently located with 2 different subway lines within a short walk. The government metropolitan building is also located next door, a great tourist attraction offering great view of the city, at complimentary access. Many dining options also available near to the hotel and a convenience store is also located 5 mins away. Else can also walk to Shinjuku train station, a mere 15 mins short walk.

The room was pleasant and clean, with housekeeping doing a good job cleaning the room daily. The room amenities were adequate that we don't have to bother the hotel for anything. The hotel team members potrayed excellent service, with dedicated professionalism, as expected of their culture. The hotel lobby was interesting, sat people-watching for 30 mins at the lobby and you can feel the buzz and excitement of the hotel (busy but well-handled). The complimentary hotel shuttle bus to Shijuku was very appreciated indeed, always on time and never late. Impressive!!!

The breakfast spread was superb, spoilt for choices and the restaurant team members were always attentive. One feedback though of the breakfast was the food tag spelt wrongly. A 'Singapore Noodles' food tag was spelt 'Singapole Noodles', no offence taken though.

Overall, had a very wonderful stay. Would love to be back if dropping by Tokyo again. Definitely recommend this hotel. Keep up the good work.",5,2012/07/02

1,REDACTED,en,2853,"Spent four nights in April 2012 and loved every minute of this hotel. Everything about this place is superb from the moment we boarded their shuttle bus at Shinjuku Station to the last day. As a Hilton Honors Gold member we used our points for the room and were upgraded to the Executive floors. The room was very nice and the service was outstanding. Our favorites were the executive lounge and lobby staff for their friendliness and help in anything we needed or just good directions in navigating the city with the trains and metro. At first the underground is intimidating but once you get a feel for it you can go anywhere. Wandering and getting lost in the underground was part of the fun with this city. Just be careful during the rush hours, the movement of people is amazing to watch. The Hilton's Executive Lounge was the best we had ever experienced. The breakfast was amazing as was the evening happy hour. It was so good we only ate meals out at lunch time! 
Would highly recommend this hotel for a visit to Tokyo.",5,2012/06/28
1,REDACTED,en,2854,"Upon entering the hotel lobby and within a few seconds of wheeling my luggage towards the front desk, a concierge approached me and said he will take care of my bags for me while I got checked in. A very pleasant surprise! After a speedy check-in, the check-in staff escorted me to the elevators and wished me a pleasant stay. Another pleasant surprise!

After entering room 3010, my first impression was that it was spotlessly clean although the furnishings were looking a bid dated. Even the dark brown day bed had permanent scratch marks on them. The bathroom was an OK size, the complimentary toiletries were from Crabtree and Evelyn, so not too shabby. Nonetheless, not long after entering my room, my luggage came in double quick time.

As I stayed in a junior suite, I was given the option to purchase the buffet breakfast at 2,500 yen instead of the regular price of 3,600 yen. Even though there was a huge selection at the buffet breakfast, the quality was only average. Hence, I only ate there once during my four night stay. Also by staying in the junior suite, I was given complimentary access to the 24 hour gym and the swimming pool that closed at 8 pm every night. Why can’t they make the pool open 24 hours, like the gym or at least close later?

In terms of service and warmth, this hotel is top notch. In the hotel lobby, concierge will stand in strategic locations to attend to guests’ queries and provide assistance. This hotel also has a complimentary return bus shuttles service to Shinjuku train station leaving every 20 minutes so it was really useful. However, I noticed most of the people who took this shuttle service don’t even stay or work at the Hilton. I don’t know why the Hilton allows this, they should make this shuttle service for hotel guests only or start charging these freeloaders. 

As I had to check my email, I went down to the business centre to use the desktop computer and internet. Very expensive! 800 yen for 30 minutes! On top of that the desktops they had were really old. The RAM was less than 1GB and the MS office was still the 2003 version. Because of the exorbitant charges, I only used the business centre internet only once for 30 mins during my entire stay.

Apart from the expensive internet charges, my right hand was almost taken off by one of the elevator doors! I was in the lobby wanting to go upstairs and was rushing for an elevator that was closing so I stuck my hand between the closing doors. This should have caused the elevators doors to open but it didn’t! I had to wrestle my right hand from the elevator jaws of death! 

All in all, I had a pleasant stay at the Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku, and would probably stay there again when I am in Tokyo again. What would make it go from ‘probably’ to ‘definitely’? Cheaper internet.",4,2012/06/26

From the frond desk, concierg, bell desk, housekeeping, restaurant and staff at the executive lounge. Will definitely come back to this hotel over and over again. Shijuku Hilton, thank you for gave us such a wonderful memories. Your impeccable service is one of the high points of our Tokyo trip.",5,2012/06/25
1,REDACTED,en,2856,"The hotel lobby is always a buzz with
several personnel to greet and assist right when you pull up to the
front door. I took the Limo Bus from Narita and as soon as my foot
stepped off the bus, there was someone to greet me and ask for my
baggage tickets. Simply great service! The room was gorgeous and well
maintained with all the amenities needed for my stay.


The Hotel is conveniently located and
at walking distance from the Metro. The hotel also offers a shuttle
service to Shinjuku Station which was always on time if you would
prefer to start at that hub or get to some food and shopping.


There is a Starbucks a half block away
for SB fans.

Hawaii, Guam, South Korea, Bangkok, Rome, Paris and Athens.",5,2012/06/25
1,REDACTED,en,2857,"Only a five minute walk from Shinjuku station. This is an excellent hotel. If you are planning a trip to Tokyo Shinjuku is a good base camp location. The trains and metro are excellent. Punctual, safe and clean. You need to be patient as it's very busy and always allow yourself time to work things out. Everybody is very helpful.

The hotel is modern and clean. Breakfast is excellent. Good coach every hour to both main airports for £25.

Stayed here on business. Would definitely use again for business or family trip.",5,2012/06/24
1,REDACTED,en,2858,"Stayed here for an overnight trip and it is definitely above the standard business hotel in Tokyo. Rooms are much bigger and modernly equipped.

Only little complaint is that it is still quite a distance if you plan on walking to or from the main subway station. Will highly recommend that you grab the shuttle bus or take a cab to the station (about 1,000 yen).",4,2012/06/24
1,REDACTED,en,2859,"Loved our stay at Hilton Shinjuku. Very easy to get to from the airport on the limo bus ( just a big bus, but drops you at the door for a reasonable price) There is also a free shuttle bus to/from Shinjuku station which is really handy. We stayed in an executive suite which was very spacious and comfortable, clean and Lots of bathroom goodies. The exec lounge is the BEST we have seen with a generous happy hour (2hours!) of great food and SERVICE. Breakfast also good in the lounge. WELL worth paying for an executive suite. The staff were delightful. Always courteous and friendly but they go a step further and actually engage in conversation and seem to remember you , quite the Nicest hotel we have ever stayed in. But the BEST was instead of chocolates on our pillow at turn down there were little origami birds and a weather report for the following day. I LOVe that :)",5,2012/06/24
1,REDACTED,en,2860,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Hilton Tokyo twice on a recent trip to Japan. Both stays were fantastic, but the second stay was the best.

Having initially booked a King Junior Suite Deluxe but before arriving, I applied for an eStandby Upgrade for a room on the Executive floors. A King Junior Suite Executive was a total of 6,000 yen. On check-in it was available and I'm so glad I did.

From check-in to check-out, every moment at the hotel was fantastic. The icing on the cake was the executive lounge. Normally, lounges have some cheap wine and basic nibbles. Not here though. Hot food, cold snacks and cocktails, all included. It almost made me not not want to leave. 

The staff are phenomenal from the check-in team, the tiny lady who delivered my bags to the room (half the size of me), to the housekeeping team who left origami cranes on turn-down. 

Shinjuku Station is about 10 minutes walk away so getting anywhere else in Tokyo and Japan in general is very easy.

I'll be back again some day...",5,2012/06/23

The location is excellent and you can catch the subway from below the hotel or take a shuttle bus ran by hotel to shinjuku station. Nice convenience store down the street for groceries etc. Laundry about 6 blocks away......concierge has a map to tell you how to get there. This hotel has everything you need. Our last stay in June we stayed on the executive level and got really spoiled. We were on floor 36 and you could walk right up to the 37th floor that housed the level with all the food and tea. I do have to say.......try not to get assigned room 3625, we were in that room and you could hear footsteps throughout the whole night until the executive level closed or quieted down......the only disappointment.",5,2012/06/20

1,REDACTED,en,2863,"Caught the airport limousine that delivered me right to Hilton. Around a 1.5 Hour drive but I noticed surprisingly, there was not much traffic on the highway from Narita to Shinjuku, and little traffic in the heart of the West side of Shinjuku station. (I actually found no traffic issues in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto). Upon arrival the staff were very Courteous, taking care of my luggage and offering a hot face towel on check-in. Had a room 20 floors up so the view was nice. There are many skyscrappers on this side of the train station. The room was tiny compared to Singapore and Australian rooms. The bathroom was tiny. Clean room with all the amenities were supplied. The complimentary bottles of water were only supplied for the first day. Had a twin bed configuration and they were singles. Gym access was included, there is not very much equipment in a small area but it is enough for a good workout. Pool is indoor. When walking to Shinjuku Station the quickest route I took was above ground, turning left as you exited the hotel and that took about 7 minutes. You could also go underground all the way to Shinjuku station with that taking 15-20 minutes. There is a 7/11 and family mart close by in the basement of the Hyatt Regency. Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building is a leisurely 5 minute stroll straight ahead leaving the Hilton and has a lot of tourist information on the ground floor and and free observatory on the top floors.",4,2012/06/19
1,REDACTED,en,2864,"Shinjuku, home of japanese hipsters, many twinkly lights, some exceptional food, crazy clothing and lots of people. Shinjuku is a super gateway to lots of the best of Tokyo, well connected by subway and teeming with the massive malls that Tokyo is awesome for. The hotel is classic Hilton, so no surprises, but large rooms which can be hard to find in a world of pods and love hotels. Also happy to be able to get a KS bed in a country where doubles are standard. For long legged peeps, this is surprisingly hard to find, and was weirdly one of the dealbreakers in staying here. Not cheap compared to other business hotels, but certainly makes returning home easy, glam and a little luxe. Look out for the fantastic Paul Basset espresso bar close by, for those who not only crave a long bed, but some exceptional coffee amidst the sweet milky vending tins.",4,2012/06/18
1,REDACTED,en,2865,"Arrived back in Tokyo at Hilton Shinjuku to a warm reception. As always, the staff are very friendly and eager to please. We stayed in executive level room which was perfectly clean & well appointed. I had the best nights sleep in the extra large KS bed & LOVE the pillows! I want to take one home! I really love the location as it central to everything - there is a short & very pleasant walk to the station and great shopping in the area. This hotel is also a short taxi ride to most places we wanted to go in the evenings so not so expensive to get around. Even though we had access to the executive lounge, we chose to eat breakfast in the Marble Lounge on the ground floor. Once again the staff are very attentive and my favourite holiday treat is the egg station. Freshly made eggs in any style & cooked to perfection! We also ate in a number of the other restaurants which were all excellent. I can't fault this hotel & I am looking forward to visiting again some time soon!",5,2012/06/13

The dining options are great as is the location if you feel like taking a walk and seeking out one of the many great eateries within 5-10 mins. Front desk staff are excellent and will go out of the way to help with all your needs and enquiries. The George's bar is great for a pre and post dinner drinks and most nights has a jazz band providing entertainment. Although located at the business end of Shinjuku it's not a long walk to the shopping areas, train station or the nightlife of the precinct.",4,2012/06/07
1,REDACTED,en,2868,"The hotel doesn't look very inviting from the outside (very few of the buildings in the area do), but the rooms are very stylish and modern-looking. I had a room in the Executive Floor, reasonable size and good bathroom. Television was large and the view from 38th floor to die for. I checked in early, so my room was not ready. I was allowed to use the gym/pool for shower and change of clothes. When I came back from meetings in the evening, my luggage was waiting for me in the room. 

Service was excellent all through the hotel, although the checkout in the Executive Lounge took quite a while for some unknown reason. (No matter, I was reading my emails and sipping coffee.) The EL was one of the better ones in the Hilton chain, good snacks in the evening, and sparkling wine was served just the right temperature. 

Would I come back? Yes.",5,2012/06/07
1,REDACTED,en,2869,"Looks like the typical 60ies concrete block from the outside but the rooms are done up very nicely and in a modern design plus extremely well sized for Japan, unfortunately they forgot to include their bathrooms in the refurb. Staff was excellent and very easy to deal with if you lack skills in Japanese, we could get to the room earlier after arriving and the concierge lady was extremely knowledgeable and probably spoke the best English we encountered on the entire trip. The hotel is located in a business area but the Tokyo gay scene is only a short stroll away which we found extremely convenient. Would we stay here again? Yes, but probably not at those through-the-roof rates.",4,2012/06/06
1,REDACTED,en,2870,"The hotel is smack in the middle of the business district - so please don't think that you are in the middle of the main hussle and bussle of Ginza or down town Tokyo...these are a good 15 minute metro ride away (on the conveniently located metro line which is a 2 minute walk behind the hotel).

The hotel is well serviced by the airport limousine bus. This literally drops you off at the door and the very friendly staff are on hand to help you with your luggage etc.

I am a diamond member, so the check in service was carried out in the executive lounge. The staff were friendly and very welcoming. The executive lounge is quite small compared with other hilton properties which was quite strange given the number of executive rooms / guests with access. However, more on this later!

The hotel restaurants were good - but expensive. The sushi restaurant was excellent quality but nearly 200 pounds for my wife and I. Yes the fish is the very best quality, however, still pricey. The room service was nearly 50 pounds for the sushi menu alone. Appreciate that hotel food is generally over priced, but even still, thought that this was a little steep.

The room was good. We had an executive suite which had a nice sort of living room feel to it and a main master bedroom. The bathroom was tiny though compared to the room...but that is being picky. Overall, good. I would recommend this type of room if you can. The room was on the 38th floor - good views too of Tokyo.

Now, back to the executive lounge - the food and drinks on offer are fine - if you can actually get in the lounge. On the Saturday evening (we were there from Friday to Monday) the lounge was so busy that a booking system was introduced. There were no tables available from 7pm. Guests were turned away as the lounge was full. When I asked to have a look, I was slightly bemused by the fact that one guest had been sat a 4 seat table and other guests were not able to use the table. Simply, not good enough. Guests were sat in the lift lobby waiting for a table which I found rather strange. To be fair, we only experiences this on the Saturday night. It is not the first time though that this has happened if you read some of the other reviews...

Overall, excluding the poor executive lounge experience on the saturday night, I would recommend this hotel as the title of my review states, it does what it says on the tin!

You cannot go far wrong at this hotel. Cheers",4,2012/06/04
1,REDACTED,en,2871,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights on a recent trip to Japan. Not sure what the actual room cost would have been because we did use airline miles to pay for the room. The hotel staff were outstanding, the service was above expectations. The front desk staff were very helpful, even though we were paying with miles we even got upgraded for free to the next level of room on the upper floors (not the executive floors). The rooms were very nice and ours even included a great breakfast buffet with the room. The pool was the only area we were not thrilled about. It was narrow, shallow, and nothing to write home about. But that being said this mostly a business hotel if I had to guess and it was set up for those who want to swim laps, not relax in the pool. So for those people I'm sure it's fine. The food in the buffet was very good but if you have to pay for it, the prices looked very expensive. When we arrived the first day we almost went to the lunch here and I believe the conversion to US $ was about $60 PP for lunch, so we skipped it. Otherwise the hotel was great, I can't say enough about hot police and helpful the staff were. The bellman and bell women were so attentive and helpful as well. There is a free shuttle that leaves every twenty minutes to the train station, you can walk to the train station but it's about a 10-15 minute walk. I don't remember there being a lot to do or see around the immediately hotel area, although there is an underground dining and shopping area attached to the hotel. When we went there most shops were closed presumably due to the time of day. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again.",5,2012/06/03

1,REDACTED,en,2873,"I've travelled outside of the country before and usually the hotel experience can be a bit of an adventure in your own personal episode of Lost in Translation (never seen the movie but the title is appropriate contextually since I'm referencing the language barrier but I'll accept the ridicule!). I recently spent almost a week in Tokyo Japan and had the pleasure of staying at the Hilton Tokyo hotel in Shinjuku. I'm usually one to wander around the city on my own but given the potential(guaranteed?) language barrier I was a bit hesitant about doing that; especially with Tokyo's huge railroad and subway infrastructure. All those concerned were completely laid to rest when I ran into Tariq Lacy. Unassuming as he was, he made a genuine effort to approach us as we were waiting for the shuttle and immediately began to build a genuine rapport with us that didn't even seem like something he begrudgingly did because it was his job. He took an honest interest in our reasons for choosing the Hilton and took the time out of his job to circle the places of interest that would pique our curiosity as well as prioritizing each location so that we could make efficient use of our time. The man was fantastically brilliant in his suggestions and it is great to put a face to such a large company like Hilton. His attitude, professionalism, ability to read people, and charming honesty is a great way to humanize what can be an overwhelming experience with a busy establishment. I truly believe that Tariq Lacy was the reason that my friend and I had more fun than we anticipated and I don't know what I would've done without his patience and understanding at my ignorance with travelling in a city that doesn't retain english as its primary language. Because of Tariq, I was able to navigate the railways, subways, Harajuku, Akihabara, Shibuya, Asakusa, and Shinjuku. I believe that he made the difference in our entire trip and he makes for a marketable and extremely valuable asset to the Hilton Tokyo staff and Hilton Hotel company. 

Greatfully,

1,REDACTED,en,2874,"We started our Japan trip at the Hilton Tokyo, and it quickly gained the status of ""home base"" for us. The first room we had was a Twin Junior Suite upgrade, and it was spacious, comfortable, and clean, with nice amenities and extras. I am a Diamond member, so access to the executive lounge was included. The Hilton Tokyo executive lounge is the nicest Hilton lounge I've experienced - the food is good, the service is excellent, and the view is spectacular. We were almost sad to leave the Hilton for the middle part of our Japan itinerary.

We returned to the Hilton Tokyo for the final few days of our trip, and it was this portion that reduced my rating from 5 to 4. This time we were in a Deluxe Twin Room instead of the Junior Suite. While it was a decent room, it was a big downgrade from the first room. The room was clean, but the furniture was a bit banged up, and the bathroom was very small, with limited features. A decent room for a short business trip, but nothing special. The lounge was once again the benchmark for the trip.

The next time I'm in Tokyo, the Hilton Tokyo will be where I stay.",4,2012/05/29

The key points that impress me and make every visit a enjoyable experience are, 
LOCATION. Convenient to Shinjuku Station 10 Min Walk or a shuttle bus every 20 mins from the hotel. For the business executive very convenient to many major corporations and for the tourist looking for a great shopping experience Shinjuku offfers the best of the international brands mixed with many Japanese speciality shops.
STAFF Exceptional service in all facets of the hotel by friendly highly efficient staff. With few exceptions English is spoken which is great for the international traveller.
FACILITIES The hotel offers a wide range of facilities including a health club with pool/spa and a tennis court. Several eating areas catering for French, Japanese, Chinese and Western Cuisine. 
ACCOMODATION May not be the newest property in Tokyo but offers a feeling of comfort and friendliness often missing in the new flashy hotel designs. On this trip we had a superb king size room with lounge etc on the 38th floor. Spotless in all areas with housekeeping staff to be congratulated on their immaculate presentation of our room. 
EXECUTIVE LOUNGE I would higly recommend upgrading to this level as the hotel offers quality accomodation together with the superb facilities of the executive lounge on the 37th floor.
An excellent breakfast with tea/coffee etc served all day plus a great selection of hot and cold food pre dinner with wine etc. Staff responsible for this facilities are professional and are very willing to assist with all requests. 
In summary this a first class property with excellent facilities. Management are to be complimented on the quality of presentation of the hotel and the attention to detail that is evident with all personnel who represent the Hilton Tokyo.

1,REDACTED,en,2884,"After staying 6 days in a shoe box hotel in Fussa, the Hilton at Shinjuku was wonderful. 
The rooms had great views and were big by Tokyo standards. I loved being able to shut the screen and make my room very dark. It allowed me to sleep in and get some much needed rest. 
The lobby is bustling with people and makes for good people watching. Loved the open lounge in the lobby. And, the staff at the lounge are very welcoming and provide fantastic service. They recognized me on day 2 and gave me my same table from the evening before. 
The entire hotel staff are friendly and efficient and will help with all your needs. 
The location is just right. I have found that if hotels are located on streets that are too busy, the street noise drifts up and can make for unpleasant nights. The Shinjuku station is only a 10 minute walk. Starbucks is across the street. Lots of restaurants and shopping nearby.

We had a wonderfully comfortable room. The king bed was very comfortable and we slept well, with no noise from surrounding rooms. The room was as spacious as one in the U.S. and we did not lack for any amenities. It is difficult to find anything negative to say except that I expected somewhat higher quality towels. Of course, food in the hotel was very expensive. For those who want to avoid the 3,675 yen ($46) breakfast, we recommend that you walk to the left around and behind the hotel, past the hospital, to a restaurant called Jonathans (a little over two blocks away -- you'll see it to the left once you pass the hospital). We had a wide choice of breakfast items including full American and Japanese breakfasts for under $10.

1,REDACTED,en,2889,"The Japanese really know how to maintain their hotels and keep the service levels good. I stayed at the Shinjuku Hilton in the summer of 2011, and now in May of 2012. I had good experiences both times. 

I stay in a standard room, which is either a queen bed or two twin beds. The rooms are a pretty basic hotel room layout, with the closet and bathroom first thing as you walk into the room. The bed area is the bigger open space, with a built in desk area and a flat screen TV. There are Japanese style screens for window shades, with a thin screen for light but privacy, and a pattern screen for complete darkness. I like the 70's-80's style leather swivel chair. Standard rooms typically do not include breakfast (2500-3500 yen per day) or Internet (1680 Yen per day). 

The rooms at the Hilton Shinjuku all have great views of the neighboring highrises and the surrounding areas. Its cool just to sit in your room and look out at the city lights at night. Tokyo has some great city-scapes at night.

The lobby lounge restaurant has the good extensive (and expensive) breakfast buffet in the morning, and drinks and food in the afternoon/evening.

This hotel is usually quite expensive but the rates were much lower last June... it was a terrific value. It is about a 15-minute walk to Shinjuku station, and the hotel has a free shuttle in case you have heavy bags. This area of Shinjuku was usually pretty quiet but there are lots of restaurant options in the surrounding buildings. Overall a very nice stay.",5,2012/05/08
1,REDACTED,en,2892,"Tokyo Hilton was much better than we expected. We stayed here for three days Apr 2012. We had executive king suite , room 3810.

Room: Hotel has 38 floors, our room was on 38th floor. Room was very large and very comfortable. It has a living room with a L shape couch and a bathroom, also bedroom with another full bathroom. Hotel is surrounded with highrise buildings, so either side of the hotel, your room will be looking at buildings. 

Executive Lounge: It was the one of the best executive lounges we ve ever seen. It has a great breakfast buffee, of course it is not as good as main breakfast buffee but it had everything you need for breakfast. Also at 6pm they serve buffee light dinner which had a great selection, you dont even need to go out for dinner. Also during the day they have all kinds of drinks and light snaks available.

Location: Hotel is in business strict but with a 10min walk, you ll be in an area that has everything you need like restaurants, shops etc.

Stuff was very kind and helpful.

This Hilton is much better quality than the ones in USA. You can imagine this hotel as five star hotel if you stay in executive room. We didnt see regular standart rooms so we have no idea how they will be. But as soon as you step in the lobby, you will see this Hilton far better than many other Hiltons. 
If you are traveling with kids, if you can get a decent rate on executive rooms, you might be saving a lot of money on food.",4,2012/05/07
1,REDACTED,en,2893,"Great welcome.We got the free shuttle bus from the station. We were upgraded to an executive room, which was small but comfortable.

We did not use the breakfast facilities.
Would recommend and stay again when visiting amazing Tokyo.",5,2012/05/03
1,REDACTED,en,2895,"Being a Gold HHonors member, I received an upgrade to a suite and received access to the executive floor with no issue. I have come across isssues with executive floor privileges at many international Hilton's but not here. The hotel lobby is always a buzz with several personnel to greet and assist right when you pull up to the front door. I took the Limo Bus from Narita and as soon as my foot stepped off the bus, there was someone there to greet me and ask for my baggage tickets. Simply great service! The room was gorgeous and well maintained with all the ammeneties needed for my stay. 

The Hotel is conveniently located and walking distance to the Metro. The hotel also offers a shuttle service to Shinjuku Station which was always on time if you would prefer to start at that hub or get to some food and shopping.

There is a Starbucks a half block away for SB fans. 

Again, this is the best Hilton Hotel I have stayed in so far. I've stayed in Hilton's around California, Hawaii, Guam, South Korea, Bangkok, Rome, Paris and Athens.",5,2012/05/02

Just a bit of a walk (I got it down to 8 mins) from Shinkuku stn, but I'd definitely stay here again. Make sure you get a high room so you can't hear the sirens as much, the hospital is right behind so there are lots of ambulances.",5,2012/04/28

Our room was very basic, nothing extra, nothing fancy, could have been anywhere in the world if it wasn't for the japanese window screens. The bathroom was the only we had in Japan which didn't have a heated toilet seat! The breakfast buffet was good with western and Japanese food. When our safety box didn't work we got immediate help from housekeeping. We paid a lot for three nights here and it was not worth it, despite geishas in the lobby Saturday night.... Next time we will find something else.",3,2012/04/28

However, we did make use of the Executive lounge which was well-stocked and enjoyed the exec. breakfast (it's on the lighter side). Hotel lobby was very, very busy but the concierge was helpful and the shuttle to Shinjuku station was great if you didn't feel like walking after a long day of sightseeing. Staff was super friendly and helpful which we found was the norm all over Japan. We took the shuttle bus to and from the airport which was inexpensive (2 hours with traffic but worth it).",4,2012/04/26

The breakfasts were excellent with plenty of choice. There is a free shuttle bus that takes you to Shinjuku station, although it is within walking distance. The airport shuttle bus also stops here which is very handy.
I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting Tokyo. We are hoping to return soon",5,2012/04/22

We have stayed at the hotel several times and have always been happy we chose it. Would definitely return.",5,2012/04/20
1,REDACTED,en,2902,"The hotel location is great, close to nearby shopping and restaurant areas. 
The room size was fine, comparing with typical Tokyo standard. The bed amenities were high quality. They really helped the sleeping quality. The room facilities are modern and sufficient. The bathroom was clean, nice, and modern. The breakfast was also great, with a wide variety of selection. The staffs were helpful as a Japanese standard.",5,2012/04/19
1,REDACTED,en,2903,"Inexpensive, luxurious and perfect for the business traveler hotel in the heart of Shinjuku.

My room was a little small, however we need to remember we are in Tokyo, and most hotel rooms are somewhat the same size. So no dislikes there. 

The restaurant was amazing. Their breakfast buffer (yet not cheap for USD37) had the largest selection of options I have ever seen on any breakfast buffet.

Will definitely come back to this property.",5,2012/04/17
1,REDACTED,en,2904,"This is my first time to Tokyo and I was stunned by how massive the city is. To be honest it will take a bit of time to explore the city that is so large and couldn't be totally covered within just a few days. We chose Hilton Tokyo simply because it was quite close to Shinjuku station and the massive Shinjuku garden for the cherry blossoms season. We weren't disappointed.

Cab ride from Shinjuku station, one of the stations that connect to the Narita Express line, is only about 700-800 yen. The walk from the station would only be about 10 minutes but the hotel has a shuttle bus service between the hotel and Shinjuku station leaving every 20 minutes. Now that's a plus that I wasn't informed before booking and wow.. this ended up being the ""killer"" feature that we decided not to move to hotels in other parts of Tokyo (to explore more).

Unfortunately there was nothing special about the normal room in particular. It was a little bit dated but it was spotlessly clean! One of the nights we moved up to the Executive Floors just to see what it was like and yes, it looked a lot more modern and up-to-date. Bathroom on the executive floor was still a little bit small.

As far as the facilities are concerned, everything was above average. The staff crew handled everything quite professionally. The concierge made bookings to restaurants a couple of times for us. Breakfast in the lobby does get very crowded at times that they have to direct you to some of their restaurants on other floors-so better get there really early or really late. The gym was very well equipped and it's open 24/7, something normal hotels don't do which is great! It's also extremely well equipped. And if you're interested there's also a tennis court.

Overall, our stay at the Hilton Shinjuku was good. Wished the standard rooms are more up-to-date. Also, more power points would be highly appreciated.",4,2012/04/16
1,REDACTED,en,2905,"...AND I really enjoyed this hotel. Hiltonian in nature, sure, but for me, their service stood out. Especially Tariq, but I'll get to him in a bit. 

First, didn't get upgraded, just a Gold so no Executive lounge or stunning Mt. Fuji view for me. Oh well, still a very nice room which was cleaner than virtually every Hilton I've had the pleasure to inspect. Beds were comfy, shower was great, tons of little bathroom goodies and effective temperature control. Even felt safe during one of the many tremors so common in Japan. 

Obviously, location was superb, with Shinjuku station mere blocks away and a shuttle bus to/fro if you just don't feel like walking it. And airport transportation is great, whether Narita or Haneda with bus service, train service, Narita Express etc. 

Other highlights include: great buffet breakfast, nice hotel smell in lobby, friendly staff with good English, sufficient gym for travelers. 

Some refinements needed: hotel floor was musty, carpet a little worn out, tv was small, hotel bar and restaurants pricey, but it's Tokyo so what do you expect? 

Finally, let me say that the concierge was great, most notably Tariq. This guy was super cool, fluent English AND Japanese. (he's from U.S.) and soooo helpful. Especially if you want to immerse yourself in Japanese culture from an American point of view. His recommendations were spot on as were his directions throughout Tokyo and beyond. Which is VERY important. 

Yes, I would stay here again and may just lay awake at night dreaming about the fantastic tomatoes every morning at breakfast. No joke, that good!",4,2012/04/16
1,REDACTED,en,2906,"I booked Hilton Tokyo through a booking website and was surprised that the price was only $220 a night for a standard guest room. The location was very convenient as it was only a 9 minute drive or 15 minute walk from Shinjuku station, I of course took the cab to the hotel as I was tired of walking and it only cost me 710 yen. Upon arrival I was immediately greeted with courteous hotel staff equipped with an umbrella as it was raining that night. The front desk was very courteous as well and provided me with maps of the local area as it was my first time in Shinjuku.

The room size and view was pretty decent. I wouldn't consider this a 5-star hotel as the price and rooms aren't up to par with other hotels. But nevertheless it's more than enough for the value and location. We went to Sizzler Sunday morning which is down the street and it was excellent. Theres also a Park Hyatt Hotel down the street which has a bar called ""New York Bar"" which was in the scene of Lost in Translation and you'll definitely want to visit there. But be advised you may have to reserve a spot ahead of time and the menu is expensive. What you'll get in return is live music, amazing view, and an amazing experience. On another note you might hear the sound of an ambulance from time to time as the hotel is right next to a hospital.

So for the price it can't be beat but it's not quite the top notch hotels in Tokyo I am accustomed to which is why I can't give it a 5-star rating. But in in the future if I'm on a budget I would definitely be staying here again",4,2012/04/15
1,REDACTED,en,2907,"Have stayed in the Shinjuku area for a number of years on business and have always enjoyed this hotel as a great base for both access to the train station as well as proximity to decent restaurants - expensive and cheap.

I returned last month after a break of several years. I was pleased with my stay as the hotel continues to improve and offers a very pleasant room, well equipped gym and a staff that is both supportive and well-versed in English. Its location is very safe and close to a number of convenience stores and restaurants within walking distance. My Diamond membership had expired a week prior to my stay (darn!) so I did not experience the lounge, but my memories were that it was actually a very good lounge.

I actually paid for the room (rather than points, which I would have preferred). The bizarre Hilton redemption scheme does not make it easy to get the type of room you would like and I had experienced a lot of difficulty with their systems (not fault of hotel). I bought a junior suite which offered a seating area and a bigger room. Of note, it was one of the only rooms I saw at a hotel in metro Tokyo that would allow 4 adults in a room at any price, and the overall price was quite reasonable.

In retrospect, had I realized that my diamond membership was expiring, I would have either bought the executive level suite or given points for the upgrade. The access to the lounge for breakfast, as well as free wireless, would have been worth the extra costs, particularly if you have more than one guest per room, or more than one wireless device. Internet access otherwise was $20 per device and breakfast was ranging between 2600 and 4000 yen, which drove us elsewhere.

Hiltopia (their underground shopping arcade) was a bit of a disappointment, but if you go across the street to the Shinjuku I-Land area there is multiple levels of restaurants that are good values, but have varying levels of English support. All cuisines are represented. Starbucks, McD, Dennys all within walking distance as are most brands of convenience stores. High end dinners available at Mon Cher Ton Ton / Seryna on top of the Sumitomo building across the street with some of the best views of the city (just bring money, lots of money).

Bedding was comfortable, bathroom clean but a bit small.

There are two reasons why this is not a five star rating. The first is that it is not on par with the five star hotels I have stayed in in Tokyo (The two Four Seasons for example) and the service response level to special requests was a little slower than I would have liked (e.g returned to the room at 2:30 pm after leaving at 4:30 am for Tsukiji and the room was not made up). So, my recommendation would be to be very direct with your requests and call to confirm things if needed.

All in All an enjoyable stay, and a good value.",4,2012/04/13
1,REDACTED,en,2908,"The Shinjuku location of the Hilton Hotel Tokyo 7 minutes walk to the station is a great plus for a first visit to this megametropolis. Also greatly appreciated is the convenient courtesy bus to the station and one to Narita airport at regular intervals. The staff are very polite and helpfull and the standard rooms are pleasant and spacious. The breakfast is very satisfactory. Their onsen and sauna is worth a visit.

Have a Junior suite, which is more than large enough for four of us.
Service very efficient and friendly and about 10 mins walk to Shinjuku station.
Irritating they charge £13 per night for wifi, but it's obviously at a premium in Japan (even in the neighbouring Starbucks its not free!)
Hotel food etc expensive as expected, but overall a decent base to travel out and about",4,2012/04/01
1,REDACTED,en,2910,"We were a party of 6 staying in two rooms for a night after our ski trip to ClubMed Sahoro. The service experience was superb from the point we booked right up to check out. As we only had a day in Tokyo, we wanted to maximise our time. So I emailed ahead to request a late checkout and asked the concierge to help us make a reservation for dinner at a popular Izakaya restaurant. Everything was perfectly arranged as requested when we arrived, fantastic! 

We found the rooms of decent size and comfortably furnished; ours were adjourning regular guest rooms on the 19th floor, the deluxe rooms are of the same size but located on higher floors. There is wireless and wired internet access from the rooms at extra cost. 

We found time to enjoy a swim in the hotel's rather tiny indoor pool which was located on the same level as its rather more impressive gym. There is a free shuttle service that leaves three times an hour for the nearby Shinjuku JR station which was a great convenience as this allows one to get to the many brand name stores around there (Isetan, Uniqlo etc). The metro is also easily accessible through an underground passage connected to the hotel. 

Staff at the Hilton were always attentive and helpful, even though the concierge managed to mess up our airport limo bus reservations (which ultimately cost the hotel an otherwise ""excellent"" rating for this review) for our departure by reserving seats for only half our party. Fortunately, they were able to solve the problem by convincing the limo to allow the children to share seats, or we might have had problems making our flight home.",4,2012/03/29
1,REDACTED,en,2911,"I like staying at HIlton Shinjuku. It is expensive, no doubt, but the location is very central - walking distance to Shinjuku station, restaurants and convenience stores. Rooms are good sized and the toiletries are all good quality - crabtree&evelyn. The staff I encountered all speak excellent English and eager to serve. The hotel was fully booked during the week I was there, and I am not surprised. I love the big windows and always look out evey morning to catch a glimpse of Mount Fuji. On a clear day, it is an amazing view. While it may seem trivial, when you enter the main doors of the hotel, it smells wonderful. I also like that the GM actually reads & responds to these reviews here on trip advisor with the intent to address each indiviudal guests comments and improve in their service and offering to customers.I think that is rare and an indication of their strong focus on customers. I LIKE Hilton Shinjuku.",4,2012/03/28
1,REDACTED,en,2912,"Had a great stay at the Hilton Tokyo. Stayed at one of the executive floors. Room was very spacious and clean, and so was the bathroom. Every staff that we interacted with was super helpful and nice, including the bellman and concierge! I think that is the most valuable asset for this hotel: they have a great team!

Got breathtaking view of Mt. Fuji from the Executive Lounge during breakfast. The breakfast spread was rather nice, with both western and Japanese options. While location may not be the most convenient, it makes up for it by having a complimentary shuttle from the Shinjuku station. If I had to be picky, I would suggest having the shuttle run until a bit later at night, for those enjoying the Tokyo nightlife.

The lobby is lively and smells GREAT! I would love to know what you use to keep it smelling so fragrant!",5,2012/03/28
1,REDACTED,en,2913,"Location was poor, pictures are nice, but in actually rooms and facilities were dated. When I got back to the States, I complained to the Travel Manager who said this hotel was the only one available due to a city wide convention, now I know why this hotel was empty.

1,REDACTED,en,2915,"I had a very high quality experience staying at the Hilton Tokyo. Every staff member I encountered was quite helpful, particularly the concierge--quite important when visiting a city for the first time as complex as Tokyo. Yes, the last shuttle departure time from Shinju-ku Station is 9:40 p.m., but two Tokyo Subway line stations are within a few hundred meters of the hotel, accessible underground. The breakfast buffet is impressive and worth at least one visit. The lobby has a modern, chic feel and is great for people watching throughout the day.",5,2012/03/12
1,REDACTED,en,2916,"I am a bit late on this review, but nonetheless must say that I had no idea Christmas was such a huge holiday in Japan. We stayed in early November and when I entered the hotel, it was breathtaking. Their decorations rivaled some of the best I have seen in New York during the holidays. 

Transportation from the airport was very easy and we used the airport bus and were dropped off at the front entrance. The train was a short walk away, though very crowded at times. If you are claustrophobic, I would enjoy the breakfast at the hotel and then venture out after rush hour.

Front desk personnel spoke English well and were very helpful, especially when I had to venture out to find bubble wrap!

The website offers two choices for the King room. Opt for the King Executive because it really is not much bigger than a standard sized room.

The bed was comfortable, closet and bathroom on the small side which is why I gave a 4 star rating, but then again this is Japan.",4,2012/03/10
1,REDACTED,en,2917,"Stayed here for 4 nights on a business trip. It's a bit off from the main train/subway station - yes there's shuttle running from Shinjuku station and back but it runs only til 10pm - so if you are out for dinner or late evening drink/shopping you are out of luck. Alternative is a good 10-15 minute walk - not terrible but just bear that in mind.
Room size's great from a Japanese hotel standard point of view - good 300 sq feet for their standard room. Nicely equipped with free water and Crabtree & Everlyn toiletries. Don't expect spectacular view from the hotel in the skyscrapper district but view from higher floors can be quite nice on a clear day. 
Service's okay - as one reviewer mentioned, language's never a problem. Called belldesk and housekeeping for several occasions and things were delivered straight away. Before I came, I emailed the hotel to ask for help with some restaurant reservations, but never got a reply. They only told me it's done when I checked in - by that time I already got my booking sorted out by someone else (yes the concierge by a certain Platinum charge card is awesome) 
Got free breakfast in the lobby coffee shop as part of the HHonors perks - very nice buffet style breakfast but it does get quite crowded at around 8 before everyone got off to work. 
I would say this is a perfect hotel for business ppl (esp if your office's close by) or couples on sightseeing/shopping trip (for its room's bigger than average), if the price is right. After all Shinjuku's a good base point for travelling around Tokyo. Would think twice if I were travelling as a family - I wouldn't fancy dragging kids to walk such distance from station to hotel at night.",4,2012/03/09
1,REDACTED,en,2918,"My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Hotel in Shinjuku for 3 nights. Although the hotel is about a 15-minute walk from the Shinjuku Station, it provides a complimentary shuttle to and from the Shinjuku Station that runs every 20 minutes. The hotel shuttle stops at the side of the Keio Department Store (on the upper-most street level) on bus stop number 21, which is at the West exit of the Shinjuku Station.

Getting from the Narita Airport to the hotel is very convenient since the Airport Limousine Bus stops directly at the hotel (we only knew this after arriving at the hotel).

We stayed in the normal deluxe room, which is large for Japanese standard hotel rooms. The room was very clean. The hotel placed us on the 8th floor in room 824. Luckily, we didn't have to walk far since this room is very near the elevator. The only comment is that the medium-size TV was placed a bit far from the bed. We had to glare from the bed to watch the TV.

The staffs were very helpful. Additional praise would go to the bell lady (or concierge) who would help transport your luggages without worrying about how heavy they are. 

The hotel has many restaurants including a buffet. There is a Denny's restaurant 2 blocks from the hotel.

Area-wise, there are vast shopping centres around the Shinjuku Station such as Keio Department Store and Odakyu Department Store. There is a huge food centre in the basement of the Keio Department Store.

Overall, the hotel was just Great! We would definitely stay here again during our next visit to Tokyo.",5,2012/03/04
1,REDACTED,en,2919,"PROs: Good room size; clean; comfortable

CONs: no real cons per se; location may be questionable to some; however, it has a direct connection to the underground train

This is your typical business hotel. That is, not a luxury hotel with all the bells and whistles, but an above average business hotel with an 'executive' lounge.

Lobby: the lobby is spacious with a large restaurant/bar; a chocolate bar, a pharmacy/gift shop in the back, and a bank of 6 elevators (I think, can't remember exactly now). The staff were nice. It can get crowded in the lobby.

Rooms: I stayed on the executive floor, which gives access to the executive lounge. This lounge is nice as it provides breakfast/dinner; drinks, etc. The breakfast was good. Limited selection, but you should be able to find what you need. Dinner is really a broad selection of small finger foods. Dinner time gets very crowded as people come for the ""free"" food and drinks. Wireless is ""free"" too. The room was above average in size. The bed was average. Someone mentioned the lack of a robe, but I think they hid them in the drawers...you have to open each one to see if they are there. Bathroom was good...had your 'technologically' advanced toilet too. Outside noise was not an issue.

Location: I did not have time to walk around; but this area appears to be close to business and government buildings. There is direct access to the train (via underground passages). Taxis appeared easily accessible. For those who do not want to spend a fortune on the hotel's breakfast, there is a Denny's directly next door (not sure of the cost though).

Verdict: Above average hotel that I would stay at again.",4,2012/03/04

1,REDACTED,en,2922,"Overall:
Reasonably priced hotel by Tokyo standrards, coneveniently located, rooms okay. Service good.

Positives
Rooms reasonable size by Japanese standards, standard amenities. Not luxurious.
Service is efficient, English friendly, check-in/out is quick.
Free shuttle to/from Shinjiku station but ends at 21:40. On airprt limo bus route. Near Oedo subway line. Also walking distance to Shinjiju. Many nearby restaurants
Elevators are really fast.never wait long even at peak times.
Concierge is helpful about everythins, speak good english, knows directions throughout Tokyo.

Negatives
The breakfast buffet is okay but not lavish and is outlandishly priced at $45, even by Japanese standards. This is a real turn off. St Georges is bar is equally outrageous, I think it is about $20 for a beer.
Every night, in the middle of the night, the civil alarm system is activated from nearby city hall. So every night you are awoken at 2:00 am by Sirens. Terrible. I realize testing may be a good idea, especially in earthquake prone Japan but every night and at 2:00AM?",4,2012/02/28

We couldn't have chosen a better place to stay, and we will return to the Hilton if we are ever fortunate enough to visit Tokyo again. I've read the reviews below, and absolutely concur about the excellent service, wonderful views, pretty rice paper screens, quiet location, and most of all, the friendly and professional staff who were there to make our stay as pleasant as possible. Since so many positive attributes of the hotel have been mentioned in other reviews, I'd like to add a couple that haven't been mentioned recently. First, the concierge staff was extremely helpful, and provided excellent information for us. They gave us advice on buying a PASMO card, made several phone calls for us when we inquired about specific places we wanted to visit, and suggested some wonderful restaurants, varying from cheap and authentic to fine dining. Their help was invaluable to us and really enhanced the quality of our trip, which had been planned somewhat hastily. Another great feature of the Hilton is the lobby escalator that goes down to a passage linking the hotel with the subway. Very convenient. And lastly, the location, while quiet and a few minutes walk from Shinjuku station, is convenient to some great breakfast options. Royal Host is a diner that is almost next door (to the left exiting the hotel) and offers a cheap American breakfast. Also, there's a 7-11 in the basement of the building across the street, and like all 7-11s in Japan, it has an ATM and free wi-fi. In summary, we heartily recommend the Hilton and wish we were back there now!",5,2012/02/20
1,REDACTED,en,2927,"Somehow the service here is very precise and consistent. You always get hello from every staff member, they will always offer to help you with transport, checkin is very polite, maids do a great job cleaning the rooms. There was even a maid supervisor who came around to the rooms to check if I was happy with the way it was cleaned. Never had that in any other Hilton. Good breakfast, good bed, good shower, enough space in the room to spread your stuff out (all important to me as a frequent traveller).
Whoever the staff drill seargent is, he needs a pat on the back, he's really good at his job. Or maybe its the team who hire good staff.
Either way the service delivery is precise and excellent.
If I had to nitpick it would be a couple of things they can't change easily. Some of the common areas have a slightly darker set of colours which makes it feel a bit late 90s in design, and the location is a 10min walk to Shinjuku station which is a bit irritating in winter if you walk it.
Also stayed at the Cerulean Tower up the road in Shibuya, which while good, doesn't stack up to this.
Impressed.",5,2012/02/05
1,REDACTED,en,2928,"First class EVERYTHING

A very profession person at check-in, gorgeous huge room and cleaned to a high standard. The views were great – especially to watch a morning rush through the window holding a morning cup of coffee from well equipped mini bar with plenty of tea, coffee and other items. The bed was humongous! Powerful shower could not be better to wake you up. 

Staff very polite and discreet, reception, food and beverage and housekeeping Team can't do enough for you. In the morning, the small breakfast queue at Marble Lounge moved remarkably quickly, the dining area was quiet and clean (despite being packed) and the staff were incredibly professional, polite and efficient. Breakfast was delicious and a very relaxing experience - can thoroughly recommend starting your day there.

During 6 days stay did all the touristy things so the hotel being where it was, was just perfect! Very quiet and just close enough for everything with short walking distance to Shinjuku station. No need to take the complimentary bus shuttle ride and loose the view of skyscrapers.

Upon arrival requested for early check-out and were asked to arrange the return service to Narita airport by Friendly Limousine bus service. The fare – with no extra cost, were added on my hotel bill so I didn't have to worry about having enough Japanese Yen.

Overall, 5 star service! As work in the hotel industry myself and being well travelled I am not an easy judge. I would stay here again.

Thanks again

1,REDACTED,en,2929,"Great hotel. I'd say rooms are bigger than Japanese standard and have everything you could ever need. Location wise, it's about 10 minutes walk from Shinjuku JR station and they do offer complimentary shuttle bus service. Amazing service.",5,2012/02/01

Front desk couldn't do enough to ensure my stay was perfect. Room was spacious and very clean. Internet costs extra but no problems with speed. Will definitely return.
There is only one issue and that's the location from the nearest train station, Shinjuku. There is a hotel shuttle bus operating three times an hour but not later in the evening so if you have just taken the airport limousines from either of the two airports to Shinjuku, a taxi will be required. Approx 700 Yen.",5,2012/01/25
1,REDACTED,en,2931,"This being my first trip to Japan I found this Hilton Hotel made for a good transition into Japanese culture. You will find all the comforts one is accustomed to in a Western style hotel - a very good English speaking staff as well as high quality and spacious accommodations. The basic room design is clean and simple and attests to the theory of less is more. 

I especially liked the sliding rice-paper window shades which allowed soft light into the room while providing privacy from potential voyeurs from neighboring tall buildings. Not to worry, there are blackout screens to help those overcome their severe jetlag. There is an electric kettle for self service coffee and tea; but, for those who are not crazy about instant coffee just keep in mind there is a Starbuck’s just behind the hotel which opens at 7 AM daily and figure about $5 for a grande.

This high-rise hotel is serviced by the best elevators I have found in any hotel - fast, smooth, almost silent and even more important, a sufficient number of them!

The hotel offers an adequate exercise facility, indoor pool, “his and hers” locker rooms each with a sauna, Japanese soaking tub and relaxation area. Remember to remove your shoes before entering these areas! Be careful when entering any area with a bamboo floor or one with mats, you will probably need to remove your shoes or fear insulting your host.

The hotel offers dining alternatives for virtually any international taste – Western, French, Japanese, Chinese, etc. But a word of caution: hotel dining is very expensive and figure on close to $30 for buffet breakfast in the lobby lounge area. The good news is the buffet offering is quite extensive and if you are on an expense account, this is probably no issue.

There is probably no city on the face of this planet that has more restaurants than Tokyo. You might want to consider purchasing a dining guide to assist you in your culinary planning. 

If you want a real culinary adventure, visit the food halls in the basement of virtually every Tokyo department store. And on the top floors of these same stores you will find a wide array of high quality small restaurants. While not inexpensive, these restaurant generally offer a pretty good price-value relationship with their culinary offerings.

You will be amazed at what is available in the Japanese department stores and should you purchase an item, you will quickly learn anything you buy in Japan is respectfully wrapped and then a clerk will come from behind their counter, present you with the package and bow. Macy’s should take note…

But if you are looking for a relative dining bargain close to the Hilton Tokyo, consider Denny’s (open 24 hours) located adjacent to the Starbuck’s right behind the hotel. An inclusive breakfast of an egg, slice of bacon, link of sausage, little cup of coffee and a small green salad will cost about $7, a veritable bargain compared to dining prices within any Tokyo hotel.

If you start to go through hamburger withdrawal, you can find a McDonald’s is some locations; but, there is a Sizzler just a block from the front of the Tokyo Hilton. While I do not normally place Sizzler on my dining map – a charbroiled burger with fries and beverage for $10 tasted awfully good after five days in Tokyo.

""Arigato"" Tokyo Hilton, it was a very nice visit and I look forward to returning.",4,2012/01/25
1,REDACTED,en,2932,"Tokyo is a complex city for Westerners to visit and this hotel makes the experience all the better.

It is a chain but it differentiates itself. The service is very good and courteous and there is a lot of help to assist you in navigating this city.

The rooms are smallish but more than adequate and very well equipped. I stayed on the executive floor and the executive lounge and facilities were all extremely good. The higher rooms have wonderful views over the Tokyo skyline.

Tokyo is so big that nowhere is near to everywhere. However, this is within easy walking distance of Shinjuku, with all the night life that has to offer and the enormous railway station.",5,2012/01/24

The amenities are all as one would expect from a chain hotel, and this one is very experienced with dealing with the needs of the American business traveler and tourist. It is especially nice if you get an upper floor room looking towards the park and the Tokyo Metropolitan buildings. The proximity to the enormous Shinjuku station is very helpful, as you can get just about anywhere in the city or Japan from this spot. Highly recommended.",5,2012/01/22
1,REDACTED,en,2934,"I stayed at this large hotel in June 2011 when eastern Japan was in full energy-saving mode, with air conditioning turned down during the rainy season; as the windows are fixed, this made for a somewhat stifling room, which was otherwise very clean, large enough, and very functional (thumbs up to the wireless iron and automated toilet), but not luxurious.
Unusually in detail-oriented Japan, I did notice a broken tab on the Ethernet jack, and a hairline crack on the wall (understandable given the preceding earthquake).

Our room were at 33th floor with really nice view to Shinjuku park. Break fast was included since I am gold member. They had both Japanese style and American style food and they were very good. Staff were very very nice and most of them spoke english very well. 
Metro line M and E is connected to the hotel via underground pathway, but just like any underground path in Japan it is a long walk.
It is little pricier than Metropolitan hotel but location and luxury you get, it is worth. But if you want to experience Japanese style hotel, I would recommend Metropolitan hotel.",4,2012/01/16

The hotel is gorgeous, rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed. Beds are large and comfortable. Staff are outstanding from the welcome porters through check-in & all throughout hotel. Special mention for Shinji at the Executive lounge, he was absolutely fantastic and speaks perfect english for those a little overwhelmed. Extremely helpful with local advice about districts, transport, etc and a really great bloke. The best executive lounge experience bar none, and really great value at only a little more than usual rooms. Highly recommended. 
Some more general advice for Aussie travellers: don't be put off using the cabs, no more expensive than in Oz, just check that you have a good idea of the distances involved, and avoid peak hours and you will be very happy, the drivers know all the main attractions or shopping districts and will drop you to the door. That being said, the JR train lines are perfect, use the Yamanote Line and you can't go wrong, it does a large ring about Tokyo CBH and all the stations are dead in the middle of each district either for shopping, or Temples/Shrines, or Sumo. Definitely consider getting a Japan Rail Pass (only available before you get to Japan). No tickets to worry about, all JR included, except the two fastest Bullet trains, and great value with unlimited use. Also if you can, you must get to the Sumo tournament if one is on when you are in Japan. Tickets are available online, get seats in A section on first floor: perfect.",5,2012/01/14
1,REDACTED,en,2940,"I went with my 5 year old son for 3 days on points in December, with a gold membership.
The service was exceptional:
1. We arrived at noon, and the reception found us a room immediately.
2. The reception staff gave my son children's slippers for the room, and a complementary Hilton branded teddy - which we will cherish for a long time
3. The pool staff were very helpful and let us borrow swimming caps.
4. The breakfast was wide ranging and filling.

They welcomed us by name, and mentioned they could help with early check-in and check-out because of the Gold status - whether that's special or not, it made us feel special that I'd taken the effort to rack up the nights to get gold.

Location wise - it's a short walk to 2 tube stations, but a 10 long minute walk (mostly undercover) to Shinjuku. we arrived by train from the airport, and it was a bit of a trek with luggage to the hotel. On return, we took the hotel bus straight from the lobby which was much less hassle. For kids, there's a park and playpark across the street, a Denny's nearby, and Shinjuku has the department stores and noodle places. We found the local metro station the quickest way to travel to the tourist sights.


In contrast we went to the Hilton in Seoul a few weeks later, and they almost made it a point not to have a room ready for when we arrived, all the little things were charged - e.g. a swimming cap in the pool, a razor and toothpaste if you had forgotten them etc. When asking about the hotel bus in Tokyo they asked when my flight was and looked at timing. In Seoul they just handed me the timetable with an expression of 'go figure'.

1,REDACTED,en,2941,"I stayed with my wife on a recent visit in September 2011 on our first holiday to Japan. Booking was made via Expedia.com which offered very good rates (approximately AUD200pn).

Our room was extremely large for Japanese standards (as it was located on a bend in the building) with nice views of the surrounding business district. We had the convenience of taking an airport bus direct to the hotel, for the same price as catching the Narita express, which would've taken us to Shinjuku station, approximately a 10-15 minute walk away.

The bed and facilities were comfortable, and staff were extremely polite. 

My only complaint was the location. Of the business hotels in Shinjuku, it is located furthest from the rail station and department stores (most of which are at Shinjuku station and on the other side). In hot humid weather, it was quite a walk to get to the station. 

On our return from Kyoto, we stayed at another business hotel for a slightly cheaper price, which we found to be comparable to the Hilton in terms of standard and quality. I would highly recommend the Hilton but for its distance from the main Shinjuku station and public transport.",4,2012/01/12
1,REDACTED,en,2942,"This hotel is in a good location - just a short walk to the metro station - very handy. 
The free shuttle bus to the station is handy but it's not far to walk.
I recommend the Airport Limo Bus service to and from the airport. 
The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. 
Excellent breakfast - everything you could want- I recommend the omlettes cooked fresh for you to order by the chef. 
Our hotel room was cleaned daily and we had fresh towels daily.
We had a deluxe queen hotel room which considering the price we paid - was nothing special and did not blow me away. The rooms were rather small but I guess it is Tokyo and it's so dense they are short on living space! 
Concierge were very helpful and knew what attractions were open and closed over the new year period which was great as the tourist information office was shut. They even helped me by making a phone call for me to see if there were tickets available for an event.

1,REDACTED,en,2944,"Been to Tokyo a lot of times, but it's my first to stay in a Western hotel chain. mainly I cant book my prefer hotel during the Christmas period. A typical Hilton setup, which might suit travellers who like to look to a hotel chain which is well known and reputatable . However, I do feel it has not live up to its name . Here are some pro and cons of the hotel

1) Transport : Narita Limo bus bring you up directly to the hotel lobby , there is a tunnel next to the hotel that you can walk to Nishi Shinjuku or Tochomae subway station. Of course, you can walk to the world busiest train station : Shinjuku station in about 10 to 15 mins. As its winter, we have opted to take hotel complementary bus ride to the station and the service end at about 940pm . pretty cool !
2) Check in /checkout : its a breeze. typical hilton service . I did try to speak Japanese, but they still response to me in English. 
3) Room : Im quite disappointed with the room as not as big as i thought.I suspected it's not even a Queen size bed for 2 person to sleep. the furniture is dated and the room lighting is dim. The only plus point is the small ""bay window"" which u can sit there and view the night scene of Shinjuku
4) Envioroment : As this is not the mall or shopping side of Shinjuku , so it s all office building , suprisingly, the nearby 7-11 or family mart is near nishi shinjuku subway station, so need to walk about 10 mins in order to get to your convience store . Food wise is ok, there are array of Western and Japanese resturant around

In all, a good hotel, but for me , wont be staying there",3,2012/01/11
1,REDACTED,en,2945,"I've stayed at Hilton Tokyo hotel for a week over New Year. I chose this hotel as it is in the middle of Shinjuku with an underground walk way to Nishi-Shinjuku subway station, the closest subway station right from the hotel lobby itself. They also provide a free shuttle bus to and from Shinjuku station for every 20 mins which is very convenient to me.

The room is good, bathroom is big enough. I stayed on 24th floor so the city view from the room is pretty good especially at night time. Staff was very helpful when I asked about the direction as they tried to draw a map picture to me.",5,2012/01/11
1,REDACTED,en,2946,"I just returned from a five night stay at the Tokyo Hilton in Shinjuku and I was very pleased with it. I had spent many days researching hotels in advance of my trip and trying to decide where to stay. I read and re-read all of the reviews on TripAdvisor and I chose Hilton because of its reputation, its location, and the price. While I kept second guessing myself up to my departure date, once I arrived I was comepletely satisifed.

It is a large western style Hotel located a brisk 10 minute walk from Shinjuku station. You can take the train directly from Narita airport to Shinjuku and then walk (luggage permitting) to the hotel. Shinjuku station is a sprawling sea of humanity and after a long international flight you would be wise to print walking directions in advance! 

Tokyo is somewhat like New York City in terms of expense (and size - though Tokyo is larger!). The rates for the Hilton were commensurate with New York City hotels and, for Tokyo, very reasonable. They were certainly much lower than many other hotels.

I did not choose to prepay breakfast but I ended up eating at the buffet every morning. Yes, there are other places to eat in the immediate area (including a Denny's and a myriad of eateries at Shinjuju station) but for quality, quantity, and convenience, the hotel buffet could not be beat. 

As a further note, there is a subway entrance directly outside the hotel lobby door which made for a much warmer walk to the nearest metro station which was still a solid 10 minute walk away.

There is not too much in the immediate area of the hotel other than large office buildings. But the Shinjuku shopping area is only 10-15 minute walk. 

In short, if you are going to be in Tokyo, you should consider the Hilton.",5,2012/01/10
1,REDACTED,en,2947,"We stayed here for one week over New Year on our first trip to Tokyo. The hotel itself is a typical Hilton so you can rest assured that you get good service and all facilities such as restaurants, business centre, gym etc.

Upon check in we were upgraded to an Executive Floor room owing to my status with the hotel chain. The room was very nice and clean with crabtree and evelyn products and had direct proximity to the Executive Lounge.

The lounge itself is no doubt something you have read about many times in these reviews - it is a spectacular benefit in expensive Tokyo. You can have your breakfast, afternoon tea [small scones and tiny pastries] and dinner which has a variety of buffet type food. We ate here very often and it was very nice.

So when you book consider the Executive floor option - it is worth it if you have more than one person in your room. We also had breakfast in the Marble Lounge which was even better since they have a chef who can make omlettes or fried eggs for you.

The location of the hotel was very good in Shinjuku so you will have good proximity to restaurants and shops if you fancy a wander, there is also a free shuttle to Shinjuku station which is very convenient although we prefered to walk there.

Quick tip on the booking, when I searched for the price for 4 nights and for 7 nights the total worked out to be exactly the same. So, if you are planning on staying at 2 different hotels double check and get a quote for the whole duration too. 

One other point, there is a hospital just round the corner from the hotel, so on occasion you can clearly hear the ambulances racing to and from the hospital even from the 37th Floor. I would suggest going for a high floor and specifically asking them in advance to put you in a room which is as far away from the hospital as possible.",5,2012/01/08

Tokyo is a great place to shop, but different hubs specialize in different products, so ask lots of questions when your there. At the hotel that is, the Japanese generally do NOT speak English. So it is a little harder to get around.

Room was decent and overall experience was ok. 

What REALLY touched us is the service. Twice we couldn't have breakfast at the hotel so we asked if I could just grab a bread and go. Instead of just saying yes I could, the staff surprised me with ""let me give you a box to takeaway""! In addition, they even gave me a carrier and some napkins :) these I thought really gave me a pleasant surprise as most hotels would've said we couldn't pack anything and breakfast was just for dining in.

1,REDACTED,en,2951,"the friendly airport limousine service runs directly almost every 30min from narita airport (e.g.bus stop #11 terminal1 south wing) to the frontdoor of this hilton, which was just perfect for us. the location of this hilton is as central as it can be in shinjuku with even the meiji shrine within walking distance.
first of all I have to mention that I, my wife and 14year old son, booked an executive room for 7 days during christmas and new years eve. we were excited from the moment we arrived until we left. the lounge offered western and japanese breakfast including hot items like scrambled eggs, bacon and misosoup. salmon, cheese and cold cuts were always the same but of superb quality. try those crispy little breakfast rolls,wow. teatime at 3pm offered mostly nuts, crackers and biscuits. in the evening fried dumplings etc were good apetizers, but together with salads and (cold) vegetables offered, many guests called it a dinner. coffee, tea, 
soft drinks and beer were served all day long, but the highlight is the cocktail hour from 6-8. if you're lucky you'll have a great view of mount fuji from up here. yes, the lounge can get crowded and sometimes one may have to wait to be seated. we got coupons once and went down to the marble bar in the lobby to get a snack and cocktail. very attentive. and here comes the best part of the hotel, the staff. ok, it's japan, it's their lifestyle but the friendliness and personal attention, even during these extremely busy days when hotels are fully booked, is overwhelming. a very big compliment to all the staff of the tokyo hilton; this is BDP. the room had a kingsize bed with a firm matress, a minibar (with a little spare room for personal stuff), coffee/tea maker and all amenties of a 5star hotel incl toothbrush and razor. the amount of tv channels is a bit poor and so was the quality of reception. here is definitely room for improvement. maidservice was impeccable and almost invisible. the elevators are really fast and waiting times are short. for executive guests the entry to sauna and indoor pool on the 5th floor is complimentary (better check the japanese onsen habbits first!). the shuttle to shinjuku station runs every 20min from 8.12am until 9.40pm. 24/7 denny's restaurant next to the hotel offers take out items and and the 24/7 supermarket a little further down the road is also worth a visit. overall the people of tokyo, their lifestyle and the hilton itself justify the long journey to japan. domo arigato for a fantastic experience.",5,2012/01/03
1,REDACTED,en,2952,"After a nine hour plane trip, then the Narita Express train to Shinjuku, we were pleased to be able to find the shuttle bus to the Hilton with relative ease. On arrival at the hotel check-in was wonderfully simple and we were allocated two connecting rooms as requested at the time of booking. We did not have rooms on the Executive floor as so many reviewers have written about but found that our accommodation was spacious, comfortable and clean. 

We found the staff friendly and courteous. The buffet breakfast was extensive, continually refreshed with good variety and quality. Try the omelettes - superb!

There is the free shuttle to Shinjuku station but we found this area a superb place to explore on foot with the station only a short, easy and interesting walk from the hotel. After a day exploring this area, it was pleasant to be greeted with a smile and friendly greeting on our return to the Hilton and then to enjoy the indoor pool for a little more exercise!

With a little forward planning we were able to enjoy much of this area of Tokyo for just one day before heading to the wonderful village of Nozawa Onsen and another great accommodation find - Alpine Villa Nozawa.

1,REDACTED,en,2954,"Our family of 6 had a very pleasant stay at the Hilton Tokyo for 5 nights in mid-December. Traveling with 2 young children and their grandparents was no easy feat but the staff made us feel right at home the entire time. I used my HHonors points for one room and paid a very attractive ""advance purchase"" price for the other. Upon arrival both rooms got upgraded to the executive level which was without fuss. The room upgrade is an HHonors benefit (Gold status or above) but is also subject to availability. You may want to check in early for the best chance or pay a daily surcharge to guarantee an upgrade. The extra amenities and services you get from an executive level room and the lounge are definitely worth it. Our kids loved the (almost) around-the-clock access to free drinks and snacks and the executive lounge team provided impeccable services with warm, mesmerizing Japanese hospitality. Our 4-year-old was greeted with daily jokes (in both English and Japanese), kiddie utensils (Anpanman) and Hilton bear toys, and was treated with utmost patience and accommodation. The view from the 37th floor lounge allows a good glimpse of Mt. Fuji on a clear day. Our rooms on the 36th floor were clean and well-appointed, as well as surprisingly roomy by Tokyo standards. We had a baby crib, a double stroller and 3 large suitcases in the room with ample space to spare. Speaking of the baby crib, it was the traditional, bulky and wooden type provided by the hotel. The housekeeper must have spent over 25 minutes setting it up with a nice mattress and fitting it with proper bed sheet, pillows and a sham. What a treat! Our 1-year-old is used to sleeping in folding cribs half the size with non-existent padding. In terms of kid friendliness, I would never have thought this hotel would get high marks, judging from the presence of mostly business and leisure travelers in the lobby and lounges. We had breakfast one day at the Marble lounge and dinner at the teppanyaki restaurant. The food and service was top-notch but we got a bit of a sticker shock considering the strong yen. The free shuttle bus service to Shinjuku JR station (every 20 mins) was nice but we actually enjoyed taking walks which took only about 10 - 15 mins. There is a 7-11 convenient store across the street in the basement of the Hyatt Regency and tons of restaurants are in the vicinity, some hidden on the top floors or the basements of office buildings nearby. The hotel is also connected to the Shinjuku station via an underground walkway lined with stores and eateries. There is a park (Central Park?) a block or two away with a playground and a Japanese shrine on the premise. Near the Mini Cooper dealership (exit the lobby, turn right and walk a block) there is a Starbucks, a neat little food mart and a pharmacy. The location is really not as inconvenient as the map suggests, even though you will not find yourself in the middle of Kabukicho or Shibuya stepping out of the lobby. By the way, Tokyo is such an exciting and dynamic city with a unique character. Even with 2 kids we managed to do some explorations around the different districts experiencing the culture, food, sight and sound. We weren't a bit reminded of the tragedy that struck this country in March and paid little attention to the unsettling potential of radiation contamination. We had a choice to skip stopping over in Tokyo but I was glad we didn't. I will definitely check into Hilton Tokyo again (or Conrad Tokyo, which I heard was very nice) next time I visit Japan. it is a home away from home.",5,2011/12/29
1,REDACTED,en,2955,"First time Tokyo & the brilliant stay @ Hilton Shinjuku made me love the city even more. We arrived in Tokyo super early realising we may have a long wait for our room but the front desk agent did everything to give us a room as soon as one was ready. Having travelled a lot & stayed at many a hotel where they make no effort to give you an early checkin, even if the room has been cleaned & is ready, this was very welcome & much appreciated!!! We stayed on the executive floor & the lounge is large, split into 2 sides - one side with views of Mount Fuji and the other over Shinjuku business district & suburbs of Tokyo - fantastic at night. The room was very spacious - particularly for Tokyo from what I've seen & heard. There is a subway station directly underneath the hotel & they also provide a free frequent shuttle between Shinjuku station and the hotel. A starbucks is just around the corner & a Denny's is next door. The level of maid service is exceptional - cannot fault it. It was always serviced to the highest standard. The bathroom is a good size with a decent size bathtub if you need a soak after all the walking you might do in Tokyo. Amenities are Crabtree & Evelyn and plenty were provided and restocked. Sleep quality was great - beds very comfortable. We called for a couple more pillows and they were delivered with a smile. The hotels main asset though is their staff who always went above & beyond to make our staff lovely. They were always polite, efficient and knowledgable.",4,2011/12/29
1,REDACTED,en,2956,"Had two stays in this hotel both a week apart. First night I arrived at 9.30pm after a long flight into Narita. Check in was smooth and front desk was most helpful. Got upgraded to a club room with lounge access based on my status with the hotel chain.Service's good as is expected in Tokyo. My requested yukata and foam pillow were ready in my room as per my pre-arrival request. Room smelled of stale cigarettes even though it's non-smoking room. I didn't bother to request for a change of room as it's quite late in the night and it's cold and I was too lazy. Next morning breakfast at the lounge was ok, don't go expecting a full spread of breakfast,rather basic continental stuff, the lounge was busy but again service was good. They even allowed me to stay in the lounge after I checked out just to kill time before my train schedule was up. The lounge affords a birdeye's view of the cityscapes, rows of trees burting with colors of different shades of orange and yellow at this time of the year made for interesting view.

Next stay was exactly a week later after my trip to Hiroshima. This hotel was again very busy, people were arriving by the busloads for whatever occasion the hotel was having. They didn't have a club room but had a regular room and offered free breakfast and internet for which my status entitled me to. Took that offer up as I didn't really want to waste time waiting for a club room to avail. This time room was fine without that stale smoke smell. Basically no difference between a deluxe room and a club room. Yukata and buckwheat pillow waiting for me in the room. Breakfast was sufficiently good at the lobby level, better than the club lounge. 

Ok this is Tokyo, don't go expecting value for money especially when it's a Hilton. It's pricey as it is. 40,000 yen for a basic room is a lot to pay for. Good thing I got a corporate rate. It's located at the office block area of Shinjuku. (chome 3), so it's quite a distance from chome 2 where all the famed Shinjuku area is. Hence the area around the hotel is pretty sterile. But it's modern comfortable hotel nonetheless.",4,2011/12/22
1,REDACTED,en,2957,"Location is great, in the heart of Shinjuku~metro access right across the street, and also via a passageway underneath the hotel for rainy days. Eateries and convenience stores are close by. The rooms were very clean with a nice city view and the lobby is beautiful. Especially satisfied with the quality of service offered at this hotel. The concierge was very helpful with bookings, directions, recommendations for attractions, and places to go. Everyone at the hotel was very friendly and would go above and beyond to accommodate any request we had. Highly recommended. Only con is that it's a bit pricey, but it's definitely worth it.",4,2011/12/19
1,REDACTED,en,2958,My daughters and I stayed in a Junior Suite and were very impressed with the level of service and hospitality we received. We were fortunate to stay on the Executive Floor and the facilities and services offered were first class. Our room was traditional Japanese but extremely spacious and clean. The Tepanyaki Restaurant was not cheap but really exceptional. The free shuttle bus service made it very easy to travel to the closest train station and we had no problems finding our way around their metro system. (I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of using their transport system). Added to this my daughter discovered she had left her camera and cardigan in the Hotel Foyer Cafe and when we phoned from Venice to inquire if someone had handed it in we were very surprised to hear that they did have the goods and were prepared to post them back to Australia for us. I am keen to return to Tokyo and would not stay anywhere else.,5,2011/12/14

1,REDACTED,en,2964,"Stayed for six nights. We stayed on the Executive Level. If you know you will be on this level, you can go to the 37th floor to the Executive check-in area. We used this area to check out. The lobby check-in seems to always be very busy. Executive level stay includes a very nice free breakfast and free drinks and mini foods from 6 p.m. until 8 or so. Rooms are adequate. Nothing super special, just a typical nice Hilton room. they do provide Pj's and robes and all the toiletries you would need. Rooms are clean. Service is above average and very helpful and friendly. A tip would be do not stay on the 36th floor in rooms located just below the executive level breakfast area. It becomes very noisy around 5:30 a.m. each morning. We used the Hilton free shuttle many times to take us to the nearby train station or you can use the underground walk way located off the Hilton lobby to walk to the subway. We used the Friendly Bus to and from the Narita airport. The Hilton is one of the stops.",3,2011/11/28

We went to the pub for drinks a couple of times and had an enjoyable time. Get use to Tokyo prices for food and drink!

The staff helped me to get all the necessary toiletries to help me prepare for some important business meetings the next day. The manager at the Hilton Honours desk rang me the next morning asking if he could do anything else. I told him I was still missing my dress shoes and tie with my missing bag. As stores had not opened yet he actually lent me his tie and his shoes, (happened to be the same size)! He literally did this with a smile! I honestly cannot say I would let a stranger wear my dress shoes, but when there was no other solution available he offered up his own things.
My stay was also enhanced by the great food and rooms at the hotel. The whole staff was always helpful and the gym was fantastic, (precore fitted). I WILL stay at the Hilton Tokyo again no matter what the cost as you just can't buy customer service like that.
Thank you!",5,2011/11/14
1,REDACTED,en,2972,"This is a good business and leisure hotel in a good, accessible Tokyo location.

The complimentary shuttle bus between the hotel and Shinjuku station running 8am-9pm was helpful when travelling with luggage (though the hotel itself is only a ten minute walk from the station).

The accommodation was typical of a Hilton hotel anywhere in the world, perhaps a little dated in places, but comfortable nevertheless.

One big tip is to pay a little extra for the executive floor rooms. On floors 31-38 they afford fantastic views of the Tokyo skyline and access to the executive floor lounge (floor 37). Here you can enjoy complimentary buffet breakfast and then refreshments through the day. However, the highlight is cocktail hour, 6pm-8pm when complimentary drinks are served and a nice light buffet is laid out.

Service was polite and efficient, as it is everywhere in Japan; we would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel in the future.",4,2011/11/07
1,REDACTED,en,2973,"Stayed 2 nights at Hilton Tokyo. Used my Hhonours miles to book the room however, was upgraded to a Deluxe room upon arrival at a nominal charge (3000Yen/nightextra). The room were large in size which was very unlike Tokyo hotel.

The hotel is location above Nishi Shinjuku station and 5 minutes bus ride away from the main Shinjuku station which makes it very conveniently located with easy access to most part of Tokyo.

Concierge is extremely attentive and helpful (and well versed in English). Marble Lounge was great for an evening tea or a random snack.",4,2011/11/07
1,REDACTED,en,2974,"The Hotel was well kept and with typical Japanese efficiency. We had a room overlooking the office block and it was quite a treat watching people coming and going during the day. The hotel is located a bit off the main station of Shinjuku (shuttle was helpful). Pretty tricky during the rainy season as you arrive at Shinjuku station and you need to run about to get shelter.

Location wise due to the hustle and bustle of Shinjuku, walking towards the hotel seems to be a tapering off sensation. It is pretty quiet on most evening as the hotel is located around government offices.

If you like the energy level of the key stations, this may not be the best option. Stick to the many choices within the Shinjuku Station.

Breakfast is excellent and my kid loved the food so much that we ended up eating brunch on the 5 days we were there.",4,2011/11/04
1,REDACTED,en,2975,"I stayed here for 5 nights (paid 3 nights & redeemed free 2 nights from HHonors points). As a Gold HHonors member, I was automatically upgraded to Executive room on 34th floor. I booked a room direct with Hilton website. Later I saw Hilton website offer promotion rate. As I e-mailed to Hilton on this issue, they immediately give me the promotion rate which is lower than the one I booked earlier.

As I arrived at the check-in front desk about 11.45pm, I enquired if I get a corner room which I requested when I made the reservation. So I am delighted I got a corner room. Unfortunately, it is a smoking room whereby my room profile preference is non-smoking. I suppose it is not too bad as I don't smell any kind of stale smoke in the room. However, my check-in is not smooth because the keycard cannot unlock the door. So I had to go all the way down to the front desk again. A staff followed me to my room whereby he try to open the door using the same keycard which of course unable to unlock the door. He used his other keycard to unlock the door and said that he will send a new keycard to my room later. I should have asked him to put the new keycard under my door or I collect it the next day from the front desk. As I wanted to sleep immediately due to jetlag after a long 7 hours flight. So I had to wait for the staff to send the new keycard before I can go to sleep.

The room ameneties is tip-top. I like the vanity mirror (magnifying) very much. The room size is big enough but the bathroom and wardrobe is way too small to my liking. I wish the English television channels would be more choice because I watched BBC which keep repeating and another English channel with not so interesting show.

The Executive lounge has sufficient food to fill up my stomach. It will be nice if they can alternate the food menu because it is the same food menu everyday.

I wish to extend many thanks to Ms Fujiwara from Concierge because she is very helpful and efficient with regard to Tokyo travel enquiries. Other Concierge staff may not provide accurate information such as open hour of Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office for city viewing purposes because I was told it is closed on sat & sun. Later, I found out from the flyer it is actually open on sat & sun except public holiday. Luckily, I managed to do the viewing which is magnificent on sat.

During raining day, you can loan umbrella from Concierge for free which I think is value-added service for the guests convenience.

I managed to get a late check-out at 3.00pm after I made a request due to midnight flight schedule.",4,2011/11/02
1,REDACTED,en,2976,I traveled to this hotel for business. It was very conveniently located to my work but I was not impressed wit the room or especially the bathroom. The bathroom was motel quality at best. The room was clean and average. The staff was very nice and helpful and the gym/sauna was also very nice and clean.,3,2011/10/24
1,REDACTED,en,2977,"Stayed here for two weekends with my teenage son in July. The view was pleasant from the 20th floor, the staff very courteous and the breakfast buffet was included and very extensive. The lobby and dining area are spacious and from the number of people catching the shuttle bus, it is obviously a popular choice amongst the Japanese, as well. I booked from the Hilton site when they had a discount promotion and it was by far the best value quality hotel in Tokyo. I liked the location. It was walkable from Shinjuku station or there is a shuttle bus that takes you to the hotel from the station. The bus stop takes some finding so note where it lets you off. It looks like there are no restaurants close by but they are located inside or at the bottom of the office buildings. Avoid the restaurants under the hotel in the ""Hiltropia"" underground area. They are very traditional and overpriced. If you cross the road and go down inside the building, there is a 7 Eleven store that sells great sandwiches, a huge variety of drinks, snacks and anything else you might need for your day trips. It also has an ATM machine. If not clear of the location, ask the staff. The afternoon bus tour sold at the hotel was a disappointment. You are better off catching a cab to the park near the Ginza area, catching the river boat cruise yourself from the park, getting off at the Yasakusa Shrine, then catching a train back to Shinjuku Station. Go to the West exit from the station to find yourself near the shuttle bus stop or you can walk to the hotel from here. Highly recommended.",5,2011/10/17
1,REDACTED,en,2978,"Stayed two nights at the Hilton Tokyo and it was great. Their website recommended taking the Friendly Shuttle Bus from Narita to the hotel and it worked out great. Price was 3,000 JYen. The bus dropped you right at the front door. The bus was extremely clean, convenient and air conditioned. The drive took about 2 hours from Narita. On the return, it took about 80 minutes.

The reception area was lovely, large and a very nice resturant (but not inexpensive) in the lobby. There is a smaller resturant on the 2nd floor. But beware, food prices at the hotel are not cheap. Paid $11 USD for a can of 7up. Yikes. You can find smaller dining establishments if you leave the hotel property and the food is just as good and 1/4 of the price.

The room was large for Japan standards. I was on the 34th floor and had an incredible view. Linens were nice, bathroom very clean and modern. 

Many of the employees speak some english and were able to provide me with directions on how to get to my destinations via the subway. I also took advantage of the Grayline Tour that stopped by the hotel. It's a great way to spend your first day and get your bearings on the city.

The hotel also offers a shuttle to/from the Shinjuku (sp?) train/subway station every 20 minutes. It is very convenient if you are trying to catch a train or subway line. There is also the red subway line that is about 3-4 minute walk from the hotel.

About the only downside of the hotel is the lack of non-smoking rooms. I was on a smoking floor, which was not my first choice. Unfortunately, there were no other options. The room was fine, but once you step in the hallway, it reminds you of being in a casino in Las Vegas.

There is a 7-11 on the basement level of the Grand Hyatt (which is across the street). The ATMs at 7-11 are the place to get cash, etc. Best exchange rate.

If you are traveling alone or with a family, Tokyo was incredibly clean, people were polite and gracious and it was very safe to walk around at night. The subway system is easy to navigate, just ask for an english subway map.",4,2011/10/17
1,REDACTED,en,2979,"I stay here 2-4 times a year. Consistently good. Concierge service, shuttle bus, convenient to shinjuku station. The executive lounge is very nice, my only comment being I wished they mixed up the offerings more. they remember your preferences for drinks, snacks, and seating. Stairs from nearby floors so you do not need the elevator for access.",5,2011/10/17
1,REDACTED,en,2980,"Stayed 8 nights at this hotel in August. The location is great in a quiet area a 10 minute stroll or a 5 minute shuttle bus ride from Shinjuku station. The Tokyo Metropolitan building with great views of Tokyo is practically next door.

Room was clean and comfortable and all staff were extremely polite and helpful and were happy to allow me to practise my Japanese.

Only complaints were that the breakfast was only included in room rate for adults and therefore it was too expensive for families with children to eat breakfast there. There is a Starbucks and a Denny's a few minutes walk away. 

Also the daily rate for internet access is extremely expensive. When you are a tourist you frequently want to check locations, opening times etc. of places you want to visit the following day. Other similar hotels we stayed at had free access from the lobby area - though there is very little seating in the lobby at the Hilton - perhaps to encourage people to use the cafe but it is quite inconvenient when you are waiting to check in/out or waiting to meet someone.",5,2011/10/15
1,REDACTED,en,2981,We stayed here for about a week. The room was double a normal hotel room with a king bed and l shaped lounge. There was no charge for 2 rollout beds for the kids. Staff were extremely courteous. Front desk assisted with booking a car for us for the rest of our trip which was no mean feat as our Japanese is limited. The courtesy bus to Shinjinku station is really convenient. Breakfast was fabulous - the omlettes are second to none. There is a great park across the road which kep the kids entertained - it also had a kids play area with some great swings/slides/sandpit. There are lots of choices around the hotel for dinner.,5,2011/10/13

Room service, the one night i had it, was quick and high quality. The room was nice with a couch, little cafe table and extra soft chair. I did like the idiot-proof alarm clock that was built into the bedside table. Gym was functional but the pool was a disappointment (4x12 meters) - barely enough to even take a stroke or two before needing to turn. Breakfast buffet was good with plenty of choices between Asian, Continental and American foods.",3,2011/10/05

The views are excellent and the TV has plenty of English channels. Breakfast was tasty with a huge range of food on offer.

1,REDACTED,en,2984,"We just stayed 10 straight days with the Hilton Tokyo Hotel. Every aspect of this stay spoke of the finest resort. This hotel pays meticulous attention to detail from the first step on the property to our point of departure. The doorman greeted us with a smile, handled our luggage and directed us to the front desk. The front desk made every effort to check us in quickly and efficiently. We were feeling the jet lag and appreiated their prompt attention. The front desk manager gave us a personal greeting and directed our luggage to our room. The room was great. The bed was so comfortable we always had a good night's sleep. Turn down service was a perfect touch and the little origami treat they let on my pillow made me smile.

I cannot say enough about the executive lounge. Just walking in the door gives you a feeling of life and entices you in to enjoy the energy. We have a favorite place near the window where we watch the sun set behind Mount Fuji. Very romantic. The food in the lounge is varied and tastes great. Drinks range from coffee and tea, to water and juice, and even wine, beer and mixed drinks. Our questions and requests were handled promptly. I expected top drawer service, but I never dreamt I would feel as if I was at a luxury resort. 

The Marble Lounge is beautiful and inviting with a breakfast buffet every morning. The selection of food is varied, attractive, fresh and delicious. I remember someone saying we could order off the menu, but we never did. There is a large selection of western foods as well as traditional Japanese food at breakfast. The chefs prepare the omelet or fried egg perfectly right in front of us. I never realized how good miso soup is at breakfast. We thought the breakfast buffet was our favorite meal in Tokyo until we had lunch at the Hilton Tokyo on Sunday. They have a large selection of food and there is no time limit to their buffet The hostess actually remembered us and welcomed us back. The waitstaff was friendly, professional and efficient. You can tell the chefs love what they do - you can taste it in the food.

As I write this review I realize that the Hilton Tokyo Hotel really has exceeded our expectations. The staff at Hilton Tokyo were sincerely happy to help us. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being perfect, can I have a number better than 10. The Hilton Tokyo Hotel has set a new standard. ",5,2011/09/29
1,REDACTED,en,2985,"We stayed here twice in 2010 and couldn't fault the hotel. 

From the airport, we caught the Airport Shuttle bus and the Hilton is one of their stops which was very handy. If you wanted to catch a train throughout the day to do shopping or sightseeing, the Hilton had a free shuttle bus that runs to the Shinjuku Railway Station every 20 minutes - another bonus!

The hotel foyer and reception area was tastefully decorated. The nearby lounge bar makes great liqueur coffees called “Latte The Mozart” (1270¥) which was coffee crème liqueur, espresso and whipped cream - delicious!

We were upgraded to the Executive Level on one visit. One porter organised our luggage while another person escorted us up to our room - top service! The rooms were a decent size with lovely views. Very neat and clean, usual bathroom amenities and the beds were comfy - as one would expect of Hilton.

Compared to Australia, they have unusual toilets in Japan. In our room, not only were they electric and heated but had all sorts of gadgets (like an inbuilt bidet) and when sitting on their toilet, the water starts to run into the bowl - have no idea why that happens, but a visit to their loo was quite ""entertaining"" ;)

The Executive Lounge is large and the buffet breakfast was quite good. If you don't want to eat breakfast at the Hilton, there is a Denny's closeby (about a 5 min walk).

Hilton were very obliging and held our bags in storage overnight (while we travelled to Hiroshima for a couple of days) without charging any ""holding"" fees. 

Would certainly recommend the hotel and we would stay here again if we returned to Tokyo.",4,2011/09/24

Breakfast was a very extensive buffet, but like the rest of TKO hard on your pocket i.e. 3,500YEN so look for the discounts if you are paying personally. But the hotel restaurents are good.

Service was excellent and most of the staff spoke excellent English and were very helpfull. If going to the airport you can book the Airport Limosine Bus service directly from the hotel, good value i.e. 3,000 YEN as appossed to 26,000 in a Taxi and takes 2 hours.",4,2011/09/18

Included in the rate was internet access, use of the gym (a bit small for an international business hotel these days), and breakfast and cocktail hour. Taken all together it was worth the extra cost. I'll definitely stay here again.",5,2011/09/10
1,REDACTED,en,2989,"Although the hotel is pretty ok, I have to admit they are taking the fees too far in my opinion. 
In my travels I am seeing more and more hotels being considerate of the traveler, but it seems this Hilton is behind the times. I am now seeing some htoels offering a work station to print airline board passes for free, and of course so many hotels offer free interent (including two I havre stayed at within walking distance of this Hilton)..
But the Hilton has a pretty high room rate and then plus plus plus on fees.
In their defense- they told me of the fees and I had to make a decision to use to use or not.....but I was already checked in- few options available.

The hotel is fine for guests. But as you can see, their fees have frustrated me.
I guess I will walk down the street to the free internet hotels more often in Shinjuku.",3,2011/09/07
1,REDACTED,en,2990,"Only stopped here for a night on our way out of Tokyo. This is a busy city Hotel but we were quickly met and welcomed and ushered to the Executive Lounge for check in, we were quickly put at ease and able to relax after our somewhat hectic day of travel. We got the Marunouchi Line to Nishi Shinjuku from Tokyo Station, it is a 2 minute walk from the subway. We had travelled from Sendai that day. 
The rooms are older style, but tasteful and a good size, not large but just fine. The Exec floor rooms have been modernised with better bathroom fixtures and fittings, but overall all rooms are very clean neat and want for nothing. We were a party of three, and two had Exec rooms. The beds and pillows were new and very comfortable, had a good rest and that was the main thing. All staff I encountered spoke English very well. The best view and food is from the Executive Lounge and the staff were very helpful.
In I-LAND tower next door on B1 there are lots of different restaurants, we enjoyed the Indian one called Maharaja, it was very authentic and fairly priced for a Tokyo restaurant. There are lots of other choices too if you have a look. 
We used the Limousine Airport Bus to get to Narita, previously we have used private transfers but thought we would give this a try. It was very good, and in the future we will use this service. I was impressed with this Hilton's service, and although this Hotel is older the service made it an easy choice to come back to when we are in Tokyo again.",4,2011/09/07

1,REDACTED,en,2993,"I was here 5 nights. The hotel service was exceptional. Every aspect of the hotel was just right from room to service. I did not eat in the restaurants with the exception of breakfast 2 days in the Executive Lounge which was great.

Shinjuku location is convenient. You can walk to the train station as well as all the interesting nightime sights. There is a Denny's next door where I was able to get a decent breakfast for around 10 USD. There are underground stores and restaurants all around the hotel which are very reasonably priced.

I opted to take the Narita Express train instead of the airport shuttle bus since it was a one hour trip instead of up to 3 on the bus. The only problem was that Japan Rail decided to cancel my train which made me sweat on the train one hour later. I barely made my flight. You may want to go with the shuttle bus.

I thoroughly enjoyed this hotel.",5,2011/08/31
1,REDACTED,en,2994,"Just walking in the door at this property entails staff rushing to help you. Their sincerity is astounding and so welcome. This was the case when I arrived for my weeks stay but the service that followed was amazing.

Check in at this property was via the Club Lounge, as a Diamond Level feature. It was painless and in moments I was in my very nice room with a great view of Shinjuku.

Every day, the club lounge staff provided a nice breakfast and evening snack service. Eating outside the hotel was easy, as there were many restaurants near or at the Shinjuku station.

Due to the tragedy in March, electrical conservation occurred everywhere. Half the elevators in most buildings were off (Not the Hilton I think as I never waited for one), all of the underground escalators or moving sidewalks, and the thermostats in the train stations were set to 'Oven' strength. It was clear that most people observed the 'Be Cool' program in effect and shed their ties and jackets.

By Friday of that week, a sinus infection I had picked up the previous week in another country was raging, and I decided to seek out a doctor that evening. The staff of the Hilton Lounge was unbelievable. They were genuinely concerned that I was sick. Suwabe-san was on the phone talking to the hospital next door to the Hilton, which told him they were full for the night and do not come there. Then he called another hospital in Shinjuku and received word they were not as busy. He accompanied me to that hospital in a taxi and translated to the staff. At all times he was professional and concerned about my health.

We arrived back after midnight from the Emergency room, after which Suwabe-san wished me health and walked home from there.

I was astounded at how dedicated and caring the Hilton was to send a staff member to translate at that time of night. The staff member, Suwabe-san, and all other staff of the Hilton displayed a service ethic I rarely see around the world.

The next day, the staff of the Lounge were asking how I was feeling, even those who had not worked the previous evening!

In every fashion, this property has embraced an outstanding service ethic that on top of the fine property and it's upkeep, make it a prime destination for Japan travelers.",5,2011/08/31
1,REDACTED,en,2995,"After a recent disappointing stay at another Hilton hotel I was very impressed with how much better the service was at Hilton Tokyo. 
When we arrived our room wasn't ready but the staff gave a us a temporary room whilst waiting for our actual room to be cleaned. We had never heard of this being done but appreciated the chance to relax in a room whilst waiting. The club floor lounge is impressive - well worth paying extra for. There are drinks available during all opening hours and then there is afternoon tea and cocktail hour. 
Our group was 3 adults and we had booked a twin executive suite. The rooms were very spacious, with a separate lounge area. The only comment we would is that in comparison to the size of the suite the bathroom was quite small. 
The staff were very helpful and friendly - we would definately stay here again.",5,2011/08/27
1,REDACTED,en,2996,"I stayed there in August, for five days. Whenever I stay in Shinjuku, I stay at Hilton, as the rooms are larger than the other hotels in Shinjuku area. The service is very efficient and good, like other Hiltons. Room is spacious (thank you for the upgrade!). The decoration is sort of Japanese-style, The room, including the bed, is comfortable, although I am not a big fan of the glass round table, which is not very convenient for eating/drinking. Typically the room I get has a nice view of the Shinjuku skyscraper. I like the view.

They have a gym and a (tiny) pool. Internet is not free, even in the public area; you have to pay 1700 yen (about 23 dollars) per day to get connected (I hate it!). It is a walking distance to the Shinjuku station, which is one of the biggest hubs in Tokyo. Probably 15 minutes. They have a shuttle bus to the station every 20 minutes, if you don't want to walk. It's a pity that the hotle is not directly connected to the huge Shinjuku station (you have to walk outside for like 5 minutes), but it is connected to two subway stations.

Overall, with the competitive price, I think it's one of the best deals if you want to stay in Shinjuku, which is a convenient place to stay if you move around in (especially western part of) Tokyo.",4,2011/08/27
1,REDACTED,en,2997,"We stayed here for seven nights in August on the Executive level. The rooms were good size for Tokyo and immaculately cleaned although the bathrooms are a bit small. The location is good as Shinjuku Station is 10 minutes away by free Hilton shuttle and it always runs on time. There are also two subway lines connected by underground tunnel five minutes walk from the Hilton lobby. What really stands out though is the service from the concierge staff and executive lounge staff. I needed to book train tickets for Kyoto during the very busy Obon time period but could not find a travel agency able to do this before our arrival in Japan. I contacted Ms. Morita and Ms. AokI at the concierge desk by email from the USA and the tickets were waiting for us when we arrived. Another night we went to the executive lounge for champagne before going for dinner on my wife's
birthday. As we were leaving Maya, the executive lounge team leader, ask us to sit back down and brought us another round of drinks,two Hilton Tokyo Teddy bears, and took a Polaroid snapshot for her. Somehow they also found out which of the several Hilton restaurants we were dining at and brought a cake after dinner. Thank you to Maya and her team.",5,2011/08/23
1,REDACTED,en,2998,"My partner and I checked in here the night after the big earthquake when our flight got cancelled. It was really expensive ($400) but the only hotel left. I'm glad we got it, because it was just the kind of reliable comfort we needed. The hotel managed the disaster efficiently, with an English-language board updated with the current transportation info (the hotel we'd left did it in Japanese only), and as we checked in the Manager apologized that our TV may not work, since most of them fell off the wall (ours was fine). We used the laundry service (again, expensive but we needed it) and called to complain when we thought it hadn't been returned to our room by the promised time. It turned out it had already been put away in our closet and dressers for us - nice! The only drawbacks of this hotel are the price (just barely worth what they charge) and the location - the immediate vicinity of the hotel is business-only, and dead on weekends.",5,2011/08/22
1,REDACTED,en,2999,"Good location, very accommodating staff, large breakfast buffet. Nicely decorated room, quiet and clean. Complimentary shuttle to Shinjuku train station was very convenient.",4,2011/08/21
1,REDACTED,en,3000,"While staying there for more than a week, I enjoyed pretty much of their Executive Lounge. Too busy that I could not come back every night for cocktail time, but when I could I enjoyed the place a lot. It was so comfortable with quite a few appetizers and choice of drinks. There are a couple of espresso machines that you could go there anytime to have a cup of coffee, with some cookies. Afternoon tea time, you could get small fruit tarts and scones. 

The room was clean but part of the room, like bathroom, looked like it needed some updates. The view from the room was amazing. You could see city part of Tokyo in front of you. There was an electric hot pot in the room with green tea bags and some instant coffee. If you need Starbucks coffee like myself, there is one across the street. 

It is a little far from Shinjuku Station, which is one of the largest station in Tokyo, to walk, but there is a shuttle bus between the hotel and Shinjuku Station each 20 min, so you do not have to walk and get lost. (The blocks around the hotels are quite big and very confusing.) I do not like Shinjuku Station since there are way too many people, but if you like city life like shopping, eating out, etc., this is a great place to stay.",4,2011/08/10
1,REDACTED,en,3001,"This is a very nice hotel to stay in while visiting Tokyo. Location wise, it is close to Tokyo metro line (5 mins walk) and also 15 min walk to Shinjuku, which is a major metro interchange and very lively at night times. Hotel itself is very pleasant place to stay. Most of the rooms are the same size and quite big for Japaneses hotel. Rooms were very clean and the house maids do a excellent job with pride. This hotel so far has been the only hotel I have stayed across many countries that not only provide baby crib for free, but also provide toys and nappy dispenser bins. Hotel staff are pleasant to deal with who will help you out in any situation. Hotel gym isn't too big but has enough equipment in there to get a good work out. Just be there before 6am if you want to get a treadmill. Dry suna is also very nice. Service in executive lounge is good. Standard western type breakfast is served in the mornings and a very good range of alcoholic drinks are served in the evenings. Beer is available from the fridge all day !! . Airport bus stops at the door step for buses to and from airport. Overall i would recommend this place.",4,2011/08/09
1,REDACTED,en,3002,The staff at the hotel were only to happy to be of service and nothing was too much trouble. A very central location to stay. The rooms were excellent and hotel was very quiet. No hesitation in recommending people to stay there.,5,2011/08/02

I had an excellent massage at fitness centre - highy recommended! Great staff in the executive lounge with free wi-fi access.",5,2011/08/01
1,REDACTED,en,3004,"I stayed in this excellent hotel for less than a week in the Executive Floor and remained truly impressed of it.

The hotel is located not so far from from Shinjuku-Ku railway station and provides every 30 minutes a free shuttle to it. The bus is quite small and tends to be crowded during the peak hours. From the Narita Airport there is a direct bus connection to the hotel. Hilton being one of the major hotels in Tokyo, it provides a good choice of excursions by different tour operators, which you may join directly from the hotel. These were among the main reasons why I chose this hotel.

My room had a lot of space (in downtown Tokyo!). It was clean, comfortable and overall beautiful. At least in my room there was free Internet which worked perfectly. The bathroom was quite small, but well equipped.

The Executive Lounge, located in the top floor of the hotel, is one of the best I have experienced in different Hilton hotels. I used it daily for breakfast and drinks. But even during the day and in the evening there was always something to eat there. What is more, there was nice and corteous staff to serve the clients. Truly impressive! I also enjoyed once the buffet dinner in one of the restaurants of the hotel. It was abundant and truly tasteful.

In the gym I used the swimming pool which was included in the price of my room. Whereas the locker room is small, the pool itself is large enough for true swimming. In the afternoon hours I often was the only one to use it, which was truly nice.

I certainly recommend this hotel, although it is a bit pricey (that is the general price level in Tokyo) and do look forward to visiting it again.",5,2011/07/29
1,REDACTED,en,3005,"I picked the Hilton Tokyo for my first visit to Tokyo and was not disappointed. As a Diamond HHonors member, I was upgraded to the 36th floor and given Executive Lounge access. The view from the upper floors is absolutely breathtaking at night, and the service from all staff, especially the Executive Lounge staff was amazing. They have a full bar at the lounge with an amazing bartender.

The only slight issues I found were the quality of WiFi from my room. Some rooms are a bit out of range, and since the hotel was completely booked, I wasn't able to move rooms.

The hotel website could also be a bit more specific on means of transportation from Narita or Haneda. I was able to find my way, but it required a bit of digging to figure out exactly how to get there.

Other then these very small issues, the hotel was absolutely amazing and I would definitely return.",5,2011/07/29

Thankfully we chose to stay at the Hilton Shinjuku as we were exhausted after 6 weeks of travel(Alaska,Aleutians,Kamchatka,Kurils,Sakhalin) The last thing we wanted was to spend more time away. We stayed on executive level which gives you Drinks & canapes, b'fast and use of your own concierge who was magnificent in helping us organise fresh flights home.The food was great,traditional Japanese of course but with a little western influence and all the staff were friendly and efficient in that lovely Japanese way.They helped us with transport to the airport and went out of their way to serve at a time when Japan was suffering from the results of earthquake and tsunami. The pool and gym were well equipped and interesting shopping was available in close proximity. Overall a relaxing way to finish a long journey.",5,2011/07/28

Very good Chinese restaurant in the hot elm food is excellent, highly recommend.",4,2011/07/28
1,REDACTED,en,3008,"The service was as good as the Peninsula across town. Really very very attentive and good. The breakfast buffet was lovely. On the 29th floor, the room was not on the executive floors, but was certainly large enough, larger than other places I've stayed in Tokyo, though not the Peninsula. Well equipped, though nothing hanging on the walls, but I didn't really care. Mild noise from the next door shower. Good curtains and screens to keep the summer heat and light out. Elevators fast. Gym small but adequate (for me), water provided, overlooking pool. Loud music and dance in the restaurant lobby one evening.",4,2011/07/28

We were very happy with the room we stayed at and the Breakfast easch morning was fantstic. We even lashed out and spent up at the Tempinyaki bar which is very expensive but was worh it as it was a special time.

1,REDACTED,en,3010,We were overwhelmed with the Hilton Shinjuku. We were visiting Shinjuku for two nights as part of our honeymoon. The Hilton upgraded us to the top floor which included incredible luxuries like the executive floor lounge (free cocktails and breakfast!!) and they also gave us a free bottle of red wine in our room. The staff were helpful in every way (excellent english). The food in the breakfast buffet was fanstastic. There were free shuttle buses every 20minutes to Shinjuku station otherwise it's about a 20 minute walk to the shopping/restaurants district. The resturants were quite expensive but fine cuisine. We had free entry into the pool and gym area also.,5,2011/07/19

Price was quite good considering the sevice and expecially the fact ww are talkingo of Japan.

Was up on executive floor with no acces to the executive louge. breakfasrt is a little hefty with 3,900 Yen (ca. 35 €/43 US$), room was very clean as usual, advantage of the hotle is the direct connection to the Marinuchi Line to Shinjuku and Tokyo station, was pleased again.",4,2011/07/14
1,REDACTED,en,3013,"This was my first time to Japan for business.
Hilton Shijuku was very nice and an excellent choice. Again, what out stands this hotel like many other Japanese hotels is their service. Impeccable!
They have a nice outdoor garden inside the lobby (strange to describe this), the receptionists were very courteous and the drinks in the bar were good.
The rooms are not very big but very comfortable! The bed perfectly soft and firm at the same time. They had free internet in the room.
They also provide free shuttle to Shinjuku station- two thumbs up for Japanese punctuality.
The only thing I didnt like much was that it was very far from any shop and restaurant (considering walking distance) and the staff couldnt speak proper English when needed, apart from that, it was a nice hotel!",4,2011/07/01
1,REDACTED,en,3014,"I stay here regularly on both business and pleasure. It is a great location, only walking distance from Shinjuku station and lots of great shopping and restaurants. The hotel is pleasant and easy to get around. The rooms are large by Japan standards and have large flat screen tv, desk, wifi, and comfortable bed and bath. Service is impeccable. Stayed on exec floor, where u have access to exec lounge. Comes with large buffet breakfast (ask to get your eggs made to order -sometimes they will), beer and refreshments throughout the day and drinks and finger-foods from 6-9 each night, all complimentary. Staff is amazing. Extremely helpful and goes way out of their way to help. Can't praise that enough! 
Gym facilities are pretty good, again by Japan standards, and pool is nice. Restaurants are expensive but excellent food. Go for the buffet on second floor restaurant - has dessert and wine selections as part of the buffet ( nominal cost) .
Shinjuku area is great, especially at night and weekends. Check out the lights and action behind Shinjuku station- like mini-Times Square in New York. Many street performers, but fun just to watch the beehive of activity of thousands of people, the billboard light and tv displays, and great energy! 
Lastly, station is great hub to get essentially anywhere in Tokyo. The area is safe and clean, train system is extremely prompt, vast network, relatively easy to use ( get a suica or pasmo card instead of fumbling with change at each station - cards are easy to get at station. Load with a few hundred or a thousand yen or...) and the cars on train are unbelievably clean. People are quiet and reserved and talking loud or on cell phones can be viewed as being rude, but they are generally tolerant of Westerners behaving in this way...). 
I love this hotel and Japan in general... Hope you will too!",5,2011/06/18
1,REDACTED,en,3015,"Stayed at Hilton for 3-4 days for business. Everything in Tokyo is expensive and this hotel proves it.
My company had arranged a transport from Hilton, but most big hotels in Shinjuku area are served by coaches direclty from Airport. It takes the same time to travel, but far less to pay. One can also take a train to Shinjuku and then take the complimentary bus from the station to Hilton. The hotel is walking distance from the station and there are subterranean paths one can take, but if you can afford to stay at Hilton, you would not worry about the taxi fare anyway.
The restaurants in the hotel are great but exorbitantly expensive.
The hotel is otherwise a very nice, safe, comfortable Hilton.
There is a pool and tennis courts on 6th floor. There is also a bar and a lounge on the top floor that is open for breakfast and evening complimantary cocktails if you take the premium rate room. ( I forgot what it is exactly called.).",5,2011/06/13
1,REDACTED,en,3016,"It was a short 3-night stay for me at the Tokyo Hilton but I enjoyed my stay pretty much.

I liked that the room design adapted a little local flavour in that the glass windows had a white sliding panels to block off the light (and also the cold too) from outside instead of the usual curtains as we are used to, which reminded me of the traditional Japanese sliding panels.

The Hilton experience was almost consistent with some of the other Hilton hotels that I have stayed at, although the bathroom was a little too small and seemed like it didn't belong to an international hotel, more of what I would have seen in the other local hotels that I have stayed at before. But the service of the staff was professional and overall polite and friendly, and helpful as well for me who wasn't too sure on directions. 

Although there is a subway station nearby, it was about a 10-15 minute walk to the JR Shinjuku station (where the main subway lines converge), which could prove a little far especially since it was February and the outside could just get too cold when it started to rain. But connecting to the airport was convenient on the Airport Limousine, which drops/picks up passengers from the hotel itself.",4,2011/05/30
1,REDACTED,en,3017,"We made the booking for this hotel back in November 2010 before the earthquake in the North-East of Japan and we were not sure what to expect. Front desk staff and management welcomed us on arrival like celebrities and showed us to a junior suite on the executive floors with great views over Tokyo. I would recommend booking the executive level for access to the lounge with breakfast, evening cocktails and snacks and wifi. Eating out in Tokyo is generally expensive.

As mentioned in other reviews, the hotel is in a great location for access to the metro (underneath the hotel) and train station (short walk or complementary shuttle bus), making it an ideal base for sightseeing around Tokyo and the surrounding area.

But the thing that made this hotel stand out for us was the friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff and managers we came in contact with, who worked hard make sure we were able to do all the things we wanted to do, and made our visit to Tokyo special.

To anyone who is concerned about visiting Tokyo at this time, I would say have no fears, the city is fully functional again, definately open for business, and safer than most other major cities in the world",5,2011/05/30

There could have been a wider range of TV channels for a western traveller, but that is a minor drawback as there was very little time to spend in front of the TV in such a buzzing city like Tokyo!
The restaurants are many and if that would not be enough, there are several good restaurants in the close vicinity of the hotel. Overall the location is excellent, close to train station, shopping and nightlife.
The staff is very polite and helpful and they were able to assist with my questions and gave me good advises were to go and explore Tokyo.
The gym and pool area is very well eguipped and despite a lot of customers, never felt over crowded.

1,REDACTED,en,3020,"The Tokyo Hilton has succumbed to a current Japanese trend for new B-class hotels -> there are absolutely no drawers of any kind in the rooms. The room is spacious enough and has a rather futuristic look - the desk is a sheet of glass. However, there new room designer has either never stayed in a hotel for more than one night or decided that Hilton guests have nothing that needs to be unpacked and put away:

- there is no dresser in the room
- the desk does not have drawers
- the bedside tables do not have drawers
- there are no drawers or shelves in the closet.

This assumption may be tolerable for Japanese domestic business travel (one or two nights max) but it is certainly annoying and inappropriate for core Hilton HHonors travelers like me who go, stay for a few weeks and work out of the room.

By the way, the Imperial Hotel and the Hotel New Otani do NOT have this problem and if you are traveling for business, your corporate rate for these properties might not be that different from the Hilton corporate rate.

Another quirky problem with the Tokyo Hilton is that the computer program that prints your bill does not understand that they have a block of addresses and the like on the bottom of there letter head. As such, the last several lines of each page of the hotel bill are obscured. Depending on just which sort of angels of death your accounting department employs, this problem can be quite annoying when you get home.

A third problem for extended business stays - the ""speaker phone"" is not a true speakerphone, but rather more of an ""on-hook-dialing"" phone. That means you have to hold the handset for those lovely hours-long middle of the night conference calls.

The hotel does have a few good points:

My favorite is the door girls. That is, most hotels around the world have doormen. The Tokyo Hilton has a corps of extremely outgoing, energetic and cheerful young women who wear the uniforms that a doorman would normally wear. They are incredibly cute. Having one of them open your taxi door for you with a bright warm smile makes your whole day (at least it does if you are a middle aged guy like me)

Another useful point is that the hotel lobby connects directly into the network of subterranean passages that connect several of the subway stations in, around and including Shinjuku station to the Tokyo City Hall. If you are comfortable moving around Tokyo by subway (the best subway system in the world by far!) this feature can be extremely handy in inclement weather.

The overall service system of this hotel suffers from poor coordination. The hotel makes a lot of mistakes. However, this problem is somewhat compensated for by their young, energetic, friendly and outgoing staff. One one Saturday morning in the coffee shop, a young woman who looked about 28 and seemed to be the shift supervisor came over and simply chatted with me and the similar aged guy sitting at the table next to me. She was very relaxed and natural and spoke excellent English. I and the other guy both walked away in good spirits with a positive outlook for the rest of the day...",3,2011/03/19

1,REDACTED,en,3027,"Located in the Shinjuku area, the Hilton Tokyo is a classic hotel for business travelers. Rooms are well sized and very well appointed with large work space desks. I was disappointed at being charged JPY 1680 for internet per day - but that seems to be the case with most hotels these days. My colleague was on the Executive Floor due to his status with Hilton and internet is free there and there was access to the lounge, which is a fantastic one. Well stocked with drinks and snack / food items and with an impressive view of the city, the lounge is a perfect place to meet if you do have the status.

The staff was quite helpful with providing umbrellas for it rains frequently in Tokyo and with directions and dining recommendations.

Note that the Airport Limousine service operates from Narita and Haneda to the hotel with a fairly good frequency and for JPY 3000 each way, it one of the best ways to get from the airport to the hotel in 90 minutes.

For those interested, there are several good restaurants close by and plenty of convenience stores in the vicinity. No major shopping centers within walking distannce although there was a Keio departmental store near Shinjuku railway station.

there was a ""stay 3 nights"" promotion going on. I wanted to pay for the 3rd night on my own and don't want her to pay for the extra night.

showed me another online website that is actually offering the same room at less than 50% of the price! Therefore, I explained myself, declined the Hilton official ""offer"".

However, I DO NOT understand after I explained myself in a very nice email:
1) Their staff (Misaki Ito) rudely replied and encouraged me to book my stay from another channel?
2) Then, when I emailed them again to confirm with them that I have booked another hotel for my 3rd night stay, their staff (Hirose) responded that if I wanted to claim ""Best Rate guaranteed."", I should have had a reservation number. Also, she said since I stayed at another hotel for the third night, if I was not planning to stay at Hilton Tokyo I should contact Hilton at my soonest to cancel. (NO!!! I was not claiming anything but really can't book through the hotel directly since their quoted rate was MORE than 200% of the other online rate. Because of the first girl's attitude, I did not feel comfortable booking the 3rd night at Hilton. Even though honestly I did not feel comfortable staying at Hilton Tokyo even for the 2 nights that my friend booked for me, her staff didn't need to suggest I need to cancel my booking!!)

Overall, the attitude of the reservation staff was horrible. 

Then, when I arrived on the day my friend booked for me. I asked for a one-bed bedroom because my spouse and I married. The check-in staff there rudely replied that mam', they follow the reservation strictly and since for some unknown reasons, my friend did not state that we need a one-bed bedroom but just 2 people, they have arranged a 2-bed bedroom for me, and I was told very rudely how I just cannot change rooms upon check-in like that. 

On top of that, the hotel shuttle bus was really way too small, and has almost no room for luggages, my spouse and I from North America has large pieces of luggage and cannot fit our luggage in the luggage area on the bus (so small!!) and we had to take the luggage onto the bus ourselves through the small door without help (unlike the other hotels that we stayed at in Japan; the staff were always rushing to assist us with our luggage). The shuttle bus runs every half hour, but because it is so small, it can be full and you may not get on and you may end up waiting an hour for the bus.

I asked the hotel staff for directions to attractions and their English was really poor.

Therefore, I stayed away from having further contacts with staff at Hilton or to use their amenities and just wanted to finish my two-night stay there and leave immediately...",1,2010/12/16

The service was very good. Below the Hilton is an Metro Station. You can enter this station directly from the HIlton.

One poor thing was that they didn't had an special reception desk for Diamond members, so I had to wait a long time by check-in. That's the reason the service is an 4.",5,2010/12/12

1,REDACTED,en,3031,"The primary reason we chose the Hilton Tokyo was because we needed a room that could accommodate three people. For some reason hotel rooms in Tokyo (and Japan to an extent) are mostly catered for 1 or 2 people. We also chose this hotel cause it is near family and the Shinjuku train station. 

If you've been looking for a hotel in Tokyo you probably realized how expensive it can be. The Hilton Tokyo is no exception. It was around $425 a night (from US dollars to yen) which included a buffet breakfast. Since they charge per person that's probably why the cost was high. 

The Hilton Hotel provided the best room we ever stayed in. Nice size living room with large TV. Large bathroom. And most importantly an extra bed. Not a cot but a real bed! The beds were very comfortable.

The buffet breakfast was massive. Lots of choices from Western style foods (eggs, bacon, waffles) to more traditional Japanese cuisine. They had it all from hot to cold choices. Lots of juices, tea and coffee. If you're a big breakfast person then the buffet is for you. 

Just one bump in the road we have to point out for those who noticed they have a fitness center and indoor swimming pool. There is a fee (about $20 per person) for the pool and a separate fee for the fitness center. However, between 9pm and 6am the fitness center is free as there is no staff working during those hours. 

Outside of sleeping, swimming and breakfast we really didn't spend time exploring the hotel. There is a small shopping area in the basement level and various restaurants. We only walked by these. 

The hotel was particularly lovely decorated with a huge Christmas tree and other holiday cheer. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2010/12/10
1,REDACTED,en,3032,"The Hilton is located right in the heart of the business district therefore at night its a ghost town. As a tourist it could have been better situated, but there is a walkway connected from the hotel to the subway station which was nice especially at night when it was cold. The hotel itself is nice, the staff was great and provided excellent service which is typical Japanese style. Everybody bows and you feel like an honored guest. We even had a staff member follow us to the elevator to hold the door and we didn't even have luggage. The room we got was nice, but on a lower level so it had no view. The beds are small but the room is rather large for Tokyo. However the walls are paper thin and was very noisy. The bathrooms are OK, but are dated and are in desperate need of an upgrade. We didn't try the restaurants as they we way over priced, breakfast buffet was $40USD per person. Overall this hotel is geared for business people, but still is a nice place to stay in Tokyo.",3,2010/12/05
1,REDACTED,en,3033,"Just followed up last years stay at the Tokyo Hilton (Shinjuku) with another week at this great hotel in November 2010. It continues to provide excellent service in all areas -- The hotel is located in the centre of Tokyo, with easy access to all points. It also provides a complimentary shuttle to the nearby (within easy walking distance) Shinjuku Station, and if you yearn for an inexpensive English/American breakfast (or any other meal for that matter) 1 block in either direction from the front door you can find a Denny's or the Royal Host restaurant. I recommend the Excecutive Level rooms which provide access to the Executive Lounge.......where, with breathtaking views of the city, you can enjoy an excellent complimentary buffet breakfast (The smoked salmon is a favourite) and a delightful evening buffet with cocktails. This hotel is highly recommended, and the level of service is outstanding.",5,2010/12/02

Best breakfast buffet I had on this entire trip. The fitness center is quite good although some more stationary bicycles would be nice. I was limited to one bottle of water for free at the fitness center which was odd. At a place like this, if I wanted 10, let me have them. The rooms are spacious and clean but the design is dated. The bathrooms are getting a bit worn but this was one of the better places I stayed on this trip despite all of this. The bars and restaurants are nice. The St. Georges bar is cool but they allow smoking which can be a shock for us from the US. Overall, very good stay.",4,2010/11/17

Best part for me was the executive lounge, which offers a really nice breakfast and a cocktail hour with complimentary beverages. All staff members that I encountered spoke English very well and were helpful with all requests. 

Only down side is that it is in a quiet ""business-oriented"" area, slightly removed from shopping and nightlife. Shinjuku shopping/nightlife/restaurants are about 15-20 minutes away (walking) or via complimentary hotel shuttle. Also, there is another metro stop connected to the basement of the hotel, which is convenient in bad weather.

A minor grouse: For some reason, TV images in our room aren't very sharp compared to Japanese hotels we have stayed at in Hokkaido. Not that it matters anyway.

P.S. For those who wants to take the JR, the Hilton is a 10 min walk from Shinjuku JR station. However, there is a regular shuttle service, so no issues there.",5,2010/09/25
1,REDACTED,en,3048,"Been there on transit to ski resort after a long flight and used my Hilton points for this stay. Was not upgraded but got free access to exec lounge which was one of the busiest lounge I've ever seen at a Hilton hotel. Room is fine and comfortable, a business 4-star. I don't really like the bathroom (except that I loved the electric toilet), I have seen better elsewhere in Tokyo. The most disappointing is the location which is very far from the mainline Shinjuku Train station (don't try to walk it if you have bags/luggage). All the dining options are very overpriced (e.g. dinner will cost you at least £50 a head a la carte unless you go for the boring buffet), so I went to the mall next door to choose from 20+ restaurants there.",3,2010/09/24

I am particularly impressed with the professionalism of the bell staff and doormen and ladies.
I find the hotel to be expensive, but so is Tokyo.
Food is great for the breakfasts. 
Very close to shopping and restuarants. Good free shuttle to train station and excellent paid service by third party to the Narita.",4,2010/09/18
1,REDACTED,en,3051,"The Hilton Tokyo is nicely located - just 10 minutes from the Shinjuku station. From the Narita airport, you can take an Airport Limousine bus (cost JPY 3000 in September 2010) that will drop you off at the hotel lobby. The bus ride from Narita to the hotel can take up to 2.5 hours in the Tokyo traffic.

You can walk to the Shinjuku station for a great selection of restaurants and shopping. The restaurants in the hotel are severely overpriced - breakfast runs a steep JPY 2500 (which was supposed to be a ""discounted"" company rate). There are quite a few additional restaurants and a few pricey shopping places in the basement of the Hilton called ""Hiltopia"". There is an Indian restaurant called Ashoka that I really liked and that offered set lunch menus at less than JPY 1500. 

The rooms at the Hilton are quite spacious by Japanese standards and have been refurbished since my previous stays here in 2005 and 2006. However, I would term them as just ""average 5-star"", i.e. there is no ""wow"" factor. The bathrooms are tiny and have drab lighting, walls, and tiles. The rooms are minimalistic, but functional. They also offered free wi-fi access this time (which I noticed has become more common in the 5-star hotels across Asia). 

Overall, this is a good hotel, but I would rate it as an average 5-star. There is nothing great or compelling about the Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku that would make me want to particularly stay here on my next trip. I will probably try the Hyatt Regency across the street.",3,2010/09/05
1,REDACTED,en,3052,We stayed here on our honey moon and were very pleased. The hotel is modern and our room had been recently refurbished. We had booked the executive club level and decided that in a city as expensive as Tokyo this is a wise move. We therefore made sure we had breakfast and cocktail hour in the executive lounge which also provides drinks all day. The hotel bar downstairs was very expensive and due to that we only went once! The hotel is in a great position as the metro is next door and you can walk into Shinjuku. We would stay here again if we were lucky enough to visit Tokyo on another trip.,4,2010/08/22

The room was pretty large, by Japanese standards. The view was terrific as well and the bathroom modern and functional.
The lounge was pretty nice as well. The service there was impeccable and the food pretty good, particularly the morning breakfast.

The Hilton is very well located as well with 2 metro stations right below the Hotel. The gym, sauna and pool are awesome",5,2010/08/11

The rooms are nothing spectacular, but they are modern, clean, and comfortable. The screens on the windows block out the light very well. When we were there the executive lounge was crowded in the morning and evening. It was a weekend, so I am sure the hotel was full. But other areas of the hotel didn't feel crowded. The hotel is a very short walk from Nishishinjuku station and there is a shuttle about every 30 mintues to the main Shinjuku station, which is very convenient. But you can also walk to the hotel from that station in 20 minutes or so. One of the interesting things about the hotel is that the gym has a traditional Japanese bath facility with the little stools and a hot tub.

Breakfast was amazing with lots of choice for western visitors.",5,2010/07/22

The service was 5 star. Every single staff was so helpful and cheerful. I was just asking a way to Shinjuku station. The staff showed me the direction on a map in a very detail way. Although the Concierge staff could speak simple slow and simple English, I could see he was trying every words to explain to me. I am always looking service directly from heart and could only find such standards in only a few places around the world. Hilton Tokyo was one of them.

With the executive access, I was also given complimentary access to the sauna, pool and gym, which were very nice. Even with 38 floors, there was never a long wait for an elevator, which were super quiet and fast.

The rooms appear to have been upgraded a bit since my last visit (5 years ago), and while comfortable and nice, still remain somewhat unremarkable (except for the modern toilet). Good location (quiet but close enough to the heart of Shinjuku) and only minutes walk to the main JR station. I also liked the nice little 24 hour supermarket nearby. The hotel also has complementary shuttles to/from the JR station, which is handy if you do not wish to walk. The best part of the hotel was the absolutely excellent professional service from the staff, but then again this is Japan so I suppose that is to be expected... but it is still worth mentioning.

We really recommend the Shuttle Bus, very clean and efficient and there was zero traffic and zero hold ups. It drops you right at the Hotel's door. Also - they had an offer where for an extra 100 Yen you could get a one day Metro Pass, it's definitely worth it as this pass would normally cost 710 Yen.

We went for Exec Lounge access to get a guaranteed high floor and a guaranteed refurbed room. When we were going up in the elevator we noticed quite a few of the lower levels did not have the same public area fit out as ours did, so I'd recommend Exec Floor.

We were up on L32 and the Lounge is on L37. You get a great breakfast up on the Lounge, incl. extensive Hot & Cold Selection and there's a permanent Chef up there who can cook eggs / omelettes for you fresh. The Staff up there are outstanding, they all speak excellent English and are all very very friendly. You also get FREE access to the Pool, Gym, Spa & Sauna, no cover charge at St George's Bar downstairs. I can't fault the lounge and the benefits of access.

The rooms are a decent size with MASSIVE windows that offer great views of Shinjuku. You can walk to Shinjuku Station, very busy station offering you access to ALL of Tokyo. There is also a Hotel Shuttle which runs every 20 mins or so, the walk is dead flat and easy and takes no more than 10 mins.

The only disappointment I found were the Hotel's restaurants. They were very, very, very expensive and after looking at the Menus of ALL the Hotel's restaurants we didn't consider for one second that we would dine there. Very disappointing as we wanted to use the Hotel's restaurants at least once in our stay but not to be. The best restaurants are out in Tokyo anyway and they're a tenth of the cost of the Hotel's.

The Hilton Shinjuku was perfect (though pricey); we chose to book a junior suite (we stayed at friends' places and hostels the rest of the trip). The airport bus was easy to find/pay for at the airport, and dropped us off at the front door to the hotel. We were there during Golden Week, so it was fairly busy, but check-in was easy/orderly, & our room was clean, beautiful & very comfortable. The hotel is in the center of the Shinjuku business district, so food was a little bit of a challenge to find, and the food at the hotel was extremely expensive ($9 soda or water, $40 lunch buffet, $20 hamburger). However, the service and the comfortable rooms were exactly what we were looking for, so we ended up booking a second night later in the week (when we passed through on our way to Kyoto).

The rate was a bit pricey, but given everything I did during my trip occurred in the hotel, the savings on transportation, etc. sort of made up for that.

If my trip had been a vacation to experience Japan and the Japanese culture, then I probably would not stay here ... it's just too western and a bit isolated.",5,2010/06/08

Morning breakfast is great. Staff is courteous and helpful. They were able to answer all of our inquiries during check-in. 

Location - walkable distance to Shinjuku Metro station. It is in the heart of the Shinjuku CBD. With Airport Transfer for just 1000 JPY.

We only stayed in this room for 3 nights as we were visting family for the middle part of our holiday and then returning back to Tokyo. When we returned we requested a double bed and our room was amazing!!! The room was a lot bigger with fantastic views of the city.

Spa facilities also good, pool was big enough to do laps.
Fantastic breakfast buffet, great assortment. Never had such dark orange egg yolks poached in dashi, yummy! Really great technique in making a perfect omelette, using chopsticks.
Shuttle to Shinjuku station just 5 minutes away, or walk it in 10 minutes, just down the street from the hotel.

1,REDACTED,en,3070,"It's a bit further from the Shinjuku action than I thought, but a nice location nevertheless. Classy hotel and no doubt it was the flagship for Hilton Asia in its day, and still far in front of most...until I went to the Hilton Osaka which I thought was a step above the Hilton Tokyo. But I digress....the Hilton Tokyo staff is terrific, though not a personable in my mind than Osaka. Aside from that, it was equal to or better than Osaka. Wonderful hotel in terrific condition. The executive lounge was large and spacious, and the breakfasts here were unbeatable. Views from the hotel rooms are stunning. I can't say enough about the Hiltons in Japan.

Staff very friendly and rooms (executive floor anyway) comfortable and have all need for work incl decent broadband. The Exec lounge is OK for breakfast but not the best. Book your return bus trip night before leave for airport. The English pub ? Umm -- not like any UK pub I/m used to -- lots of smoking, not English style food and a live jazz act, Oh and a cover charge unless staying on the Exec floors.",4,2010/05/01
1,REDACTED,en,3072,"Having never been to Tokyo before- i can only compare the Hilton to 5 star hotels elsewhere- first , it is simply impossible to get there in less than 90 minutes from Narita- the limosine bus that goes right to Shinjukho took two hours each way. I chose the hotel because it had executive floor and a nice looking gym. There were hotels that looked much better- but were $500/800 per night- so this fit my $300 price target. And there is nothing wrong with it. The rooms are small (maybe they all are in Tokyo)- bathroom smaller- but very fresh , clean and quiet. Hotel recently re-done. The gym adaquate- the indoor pool a bit small but pleasant. The executive lounge had great breakfast- 2 free computers to use- i was poured VERY strong drinks in the evening- with snacks that were only fair. There is a shuttle bus every 20 minutes to Shinjuko station that is one of the biggest.",4,2010/04/29
1,REDACTED,en,3073,"Our first stay was in July 2007 and was so good we decided to return to this hotel again, and we were not disappointed. Once again the service was excellent, the rooms were lovely and clean and the staff can't do enough for you. On check-in, there had been a miscommunication between the travel agency and the hotel, and we found 2 rooms booked, but for only one person in each (instead of 2). Despite being fully booked when we made the reservation, there was no hesitation in solving the problem, and we were given the two adjoining twin rooms we had originally requested.
The breakfast served downstairs was a lovely selection of Western and Japanese, although on our budget, we couldn't do this on a daily basis. 

The beauty of staying in Shinjuku is there is no shortage of places to obtain food. Most nights we would stop off at Keio and purchase some of the lovely food they sell on B1, which is always beautifully packaged up to take back to the hotel. It is mostly Japanese food, but there are a few counters that give you an alternative (i.e. Italian). With the Aussie $ down against the Yen, it wasn't as cheap for us as last time (it was level then) but still a great alternative.

With Shinjuku Station so close - 15 minute walk, or catch the courtesy Hilton bus which leaves every 20 minutes and drops you off at the Station - we were able to get around Tokyo easily. We purchased a Suica card on our last visit, so just topped it up with a few thousand Yen and we were off. We mostly used the JR Yamanote line, which does a look around the most visited places in Tokyo. We were also easily able to get out to Disneyland and DisneySea by taking the JR Chuo Line Rapid to Tokyo, then a 10 minute walk through the Tokyo Station to catch the JR Keio line out to Maihama Station, right outside Disneyland. We were also able to use our Suica card for these trips too.

We love Tokyo so much, this won't be our last trip, and we will definitely stay at the Hilton again.",5,2010/04/28
1,REDACTED,en,3074,"My wife and two children, ages 10 and 7, and I wanted a nice room in a quality hotel that would fit all of us at a reasonable price. This is a challenging combination in Tokyo, but the Hilton met our needs. The hotel provided two extra single beds for each of my children so the four of slept comfortably. Service was excellent and prompt. The cleaners left nice little touches for my kids like positioning their stuffed animals in cute positions on their beds. My kids thought this was great.

The buffet breakfast on the ground floor was very good, with a wide variety of Asian and western food. The location worked well for us. It was close to both my work meetings and to leisure activities for the family. The very busy Shinjuku train station was a short walk away. There are also some food options around the block from the hotel for those looking to spend less on their meals.

No real downsides to this place but the room felt a little tired, though it is certainly maintained well. I listed this hotel as a four for value but that shouldn't be confused for inexpensive. We paid close to $300 a night but that was cheaper than getting two rooms for the four us.

Prior to that, I went for a swim in the pool that is rather small, but satisfactory for lapping. The womens lockeroom had adequate facilites for showering, drying hair, and feeling refreshed. The hotel had some issues with the elevators, but the rooms made up for that as well as the executive level breakfast. The catering was magnificant served during our meetings, and the departmental photo was also organized professionally and turned out very nice.

1,REDACTED,en,3078,"My husband and I have just returned from Tokyo where we enjoyed a 3 night and a separate 2 night stay at the Hilton. We had been fortunate to book our rooms during the Hilton's recent advanced purchase, half price weekend sale, so were able to enjoy a junior suite for around the cost of a regular room. On our return stay we were able to purchase an upgrade for minimal cost, giving us access to their executive lounge and free internet access.

Service is impeccable. All staff are friendly and nothing is too much effort. All staff speak faultless english making the stay very easy. Our room was huge, with a modern japanese style and well appointed but compact western bathroom. The room was so quiet, we heard nothing from the corridor or near by lifts. Bed comfy, aircon quiet and the right temp, great range of toiletries etc. The breakfast buffet was an extensive range of western and japanese food and staff coped very well with the volume of guests (our second visit was during their spring long weekend, a very busy time).

Like almost every building we saw in Japan, the hotel is spotlessly clean and perfectly maintained. The housemaids do a turn down service and clean the bins and offer you fresh towels if you want. 

The hotel is an easy 15 min walk to Shinjuku station and many department stores and the restaurants and nightlife of East Shinjuku. The hotel runs a free mini bus to and from the station each twenty minutes. We had english language newspapers delivered every day without having to ask.

The concierges (there were always at least 2, so no waiting) were always very helpful and as is the japanese way, expected no tip. Likewise the number of people to check you in and out meant this was also very efficient, there must have been 6 staff at reception when we checked out.

We enjoyed a beautiful meal in their French restaurant, clearly a special occasion venue, but by japanese restaurant standards it was not an unreasonable cost for the high quality food and service. On our return visit, a number of staff approached to ask if we were enjoying our stay and offerring their assistance, making us feel very welcome.

We would definitely stay again and would recommend the hotel to others, we couldn't find any fault.",5,2010/03/23
1,REDACTED,en,3079,"Tokyo's always been pricey city and any 5 star hotel, good or bad, can lighten your wallet a bit. My signifcant other and I wanted to avoid the usual shoebox hotels in Tokyo, so somehow we ended up the Tokyo Hilton. Probably like many of you, there were preconceptions with Tokyo and Hilton. Gleaning from Lost In Translation, Tokyo can be such a metropolis in a parallel universe. And for Hilton, having a night visioned viewing of Paris Hilton would give the Hilton name a different zing. So with that, our stay in the Tokyo Hilton started with a revonated room but with a typical beige plasticky Japanese hotel bathroom. 

The view was of buildings and streets, just like any typical view in a city, but at night, it just lit up and somehow it just felt right. The room was spacious so we didn't have to reconfigure the furniture to fit our suitcases, although I gathered the front desk gave me a slightly larger room judging from the fire escape map. I wasn't a fan of the glass table/desk though, as the supporting legs can be a toe jam hazard. The sheets were soft, there wasn't any dust on ledges anywhere, and they actually had decent bathroom amnenties that didn't smell like latex gloves. Housekeeping did have to bring me another water kettle though as the one in our room was lined with water plaque. And for this inconvenience, they gave us some fruit - actually 1 plum, 1 apple and 1 banana I may add - to be fair though, they do sell ""premium"" single bananas in the supermarkets for like 280 yen, so it's not like the Housekeeping manager decided to give me half his lunch.

You can always be rest assured with 5 star service in the Tokyo Hilton. The rooms are immaculately made up, the Concierge is experienced and knowledgable and the front desk never roll their eyes- so your needs be will tended too. 

There's a shuttle bus to Shinjiku every 20 minutes, and if you're up for it, walking just takes 15 minutes. I didn't eat in the hotel at all as you will be overwhelmed with food choices in Shinjiku alone. And if you do your homework before you arrive Tokyo, you would have lined up all the great dining spots from the fish market to various fine dining spots.

My original decision to stay at the Hilton was to strike a balance between price and room size. It was value for money considering what is offered in Tokyo, so I may be back, that's if I don't put down a little more for the Penninsula next time!",5,2010/03/21

The rooms are nice, but walls are very thin and you can hear all what is happening next door. Fitness rooms, internet, and most other extras are expensive add-on costs.

1,REDACTED,en,3083,"Hilton Tokyo 01.17.10

Whatever you might have expected before you got here, you probably underestimated the hospitality of Japan and the people of this monster city. 

The Hilton Tokyo, (there are also other Hiltons, including one at Narita airport), is in the luxury class for sure and deserves top ratings, both as compared with other hotels in the area and globally.

This sounds like an overly enthusiastic exaggeration, but it is true.

With some 45 years of world travel and thousands of hotel nights behind me, I can say it with conviction.

Every aspect of the service and facilities is top drawer. Apparently, the hotel was totally renovated a year or so ago and for all purposes, it is a sparkling new property with every convenience. We had a 30th floor up-graded, (they said), room with a stunning view towards the Shinjuku station area about a half mile east. At night, the view beyond and towards the center of the sprawling city was spectacular.

Arrival welcome was perfect. Desk personnel should be used to train all US hotel staff in courtesy, efficiency and knowledge.

Cute and efficient are only way to describe door/entry personnel who welcomed our airport bus and immediately handled luggage carefully and quickly. It was in the room almost as soon as we were.

All room elements were perfect with great, comfortable beds, plenty of storage space, LCD TV, computer access, (hi speed internet service, if you want it, is about $20/day), excellent lighting, mini fridge, all day water boiler for tea/coffee, safe, big closet with real wooden hangers and much, much more….things I don’t see in top of the line hotels elsewhere. The most interesting novelty in the bathroom was a combination bidet and squirt toilet seat. It might take you awhile to figure it out, but it is different. Certainly a new high in personal hygene.

Things to know:
Hotel area, Shinjuku, is great as a base for business or tourism. Quite and safe with restaurants outside hotel costing considerably less than hotel food places. 

Long ride from Narita airport, and with traffic, prepare yourself for as much as 2 hours or more to get from airport to hotel.

Prices in Tokyo, with current dollar value, are steep, but match those of most other World Class cities. 
Bar prices in the hotel are about the same as in New York, Paris, Frankfurt or San Francisco. 
There is NO TIPPING or add on taxes, so it is not as bad as it first looks, but be prepared for $20 drinks and bottle prices that are prohibitive for some of us poor USA tourists.
Meals can also be costly and if you can deal with the local places, you can eat for a lot less. In general, most restaurants that are not at street level and have a western name will be cheaper. This is not always the case, because there are some top places with American names, but there is a Denny’s, (not the same menu as US Denny’s, but adequate food 24 hours a day), almost next door and another English-based restaurant, Royal Host, down the street where breakfast or lunch can run at less than $10-15 each. 
Most meals I ordered anywhere were fine, but portions are smaller than one might expect and they reflect one reason that there are very few visible fat Japanese. If you want to lose weight, this is the place to come because fats and carbs are not as common on most menus, with the exception of noodles which are, of course, a staple. But dining in house at the hotel will set you back about the same as it would in other major hotels in any big city elsewhere. 

Nearby, within walking distance, are two Hyatt properties with top rated restaurants and the price of a dinner there will be in the $200-300 per person range or more. Michelin stars notwithstanding, food quality seems to vary and often you may be paying for the flash and glamour as much as for the food and beverage.

This is the quietest hotel I have ever been in as far back as I can recall. I heard no outside or inside noise over the five day stay. Even the elevators are silent! Only exception is that there is a major hospital next door and occasionally ambulances arrive with accompanying sirens. 

You can dine or have tea in the lobby patio restaurant at any time, but the St. George bar, which permits smoking, closes at one a.m.

Free hotel buses go to and from the Shinjuku station, the nearest rail and subway hub, every 30 minutes. Airport limo/shuttles will cost in the $30 range one way and should be booked well in advance.

If you want nightlife, remember that subways are closed (literally), from midnight to 5 a.m. and during that time, taxi is your only option, other than walking. Taxis are expensive.

English is spoken here, but less so elsewhere in Tokyo. If you need help, there are plenty of uniformed personnel everywhere throughout the city and they all seem willing to help with just about any problem you may have.

Although I don’t usually book Hilton properties because a few years back they tossed out several thousand of my Hilton Honors points when I was not using their hotels enough to suit them, I will still recommend this hotel as a fine place to hang your hat in Tokyo.

One other comment: if you are not accustomed to big city homless camping and living in the parks and on teh streets, Tokyo will perhaps shock you. Even on the Imperial Palace grounds, there are hundreds of dug in homeless with their temporary tent shelters camped out.Unlike street people in other cities, they keep to themselves and do not bother anyone. As far as we saw, the police ignore them. We saw no beggars anywhere.",5,2010/01/19

We were staggering around in that ""Lost In Translation"" fug and were whisked up to our room which was very large by Japanese standards. The three of us (two adults and a 16 year old) fell onto our beds (two queens) with a sigh of relief. 

This review is hard for me to write because we also stayed three nights at the Park Hyatt, so it's like comparing apples to oranges. But, the Hilton was great. Our room was large, the beds were comfortable, the walk to Shinjuku station and the bustling bits was interesting and not too far, service was good, the bathroom was just fine. It's just not the Park Hyatt. But would I stay there again? Yes. I don't usually like Hiltons but I was pleasantly surprised by this one.",4,2010/01/19
1,REDACTED,en,3085,"Stay 5 nights at Hilton Tokyo over Christmas. The check in was very slow, it took about 25 minutes, i was told the rooms were not available even it was 3:30 PM. There was no seating at all at the lobby for my children to sit while waiting to be checked. We were all very tired after 13 hours flight plus 2 hours bus trip from the airport. The front desk staff were not very frinedly. They all looked very serious, there was no welcome no smile. maybe that is the nature of Japanese. But for an international hotel chain, it wasn't good enough. The interconnecting rooms were Ok in size. But the bathroom was very very tiny.
the breakfast was really good with Western and Japanese food available. The the waiting staff were not very frinedly. 

The location is not the best as there are really no shops around the hotel. There are shuttle bus to Shinjuku. But the lastest one is 9:30. We missed it one night. The walk is around 15 -20 minutes back to the hotel.

The conceirge booked the wrong airport bus for us to go to airport the day we leave for Vienna. I requested the 7:10 AM bus but they booked 6:10 for us. Only found out the night before as I settled the bill the night before we leave due to early flight.
That was a huge mistake. Double check if you have to booked with the conceirge as they are very busy and mistake can happen.

There are fitness and swimming pool but you need to pay to get in.

1,REDACTED,en,3087,"well I felt like I was staying at the room from the movie Lost in Translation! Even though it’s not the same hotel (I believe Lost in Translation was filmed at the Hyatt Tokyo), the hotels are in the same area of the city and very close to each other so the view is VERY similar (or so was the view at the room I stayed at which was on the 25th floor). It really was fantastic! Especially at night!

Lots of the reviews here complain about the size of the room. I have to say mine was OK. Not huge but OK (like any other Hilton in North America). I guess the size of the room may depend on the type of room you book (the room I had looked VERY different from the pictures posted in some of the reviews).

Other than the rooms, the hotel is very clean and with good service. The staff downstairs may seem cold but I believe this to be due to the language barrier only - they were always willing to help! The hotel has a couple of VERY expensive restaurants. I don't think its worth eating at any of them. If you have to eat at the hotel order room service, it’s a bit cheaper and the food is great! Also, I noticed they had a dessert buffet downstairs late in the afternoon one day. Not sure if it was something special or if it was there every day, but it looked delicious!

The location of the hotel is perfect, with a train station at walking distance and another station a 5 minute walk away (there's also a free hotel shuttle that will take you).

-Eat breakfast at Denny's located one block from the hotel.

1,REDACTED,en,3093,"In November, I stayed for the second time in the Hilton in Shinjuku Tokyo. And each time, I had to ""fight"" to get executive lounge access.

In both cases, I opened my laptop, went to the internet hilton site and showed them that I can still book an executive room. After doing so, they gave me (after calling around forever) a room with exec lounge access. Not good, Hilton ! 

Except of the cumbersome and irritating check in, all the other services are outstanding and the other people (though, I believe they are instructed to behave this way at the check in by the Hilton management) are very customer oriented.

1,REDACTED,en,3095,"We returned last night from 6 nights at the Tokyo Hilton. This property was part of a package vacation we purchased. The package itself (out of LAX) was very inexpensive and included air on Singapore airlines, bus transfers from Narita to the Hilton and a half day tour. When we arrived at the Hilton we had no perspective on whether the hotel was centrally located. The lobby is large and beautiful. We were given a room on the 14th floor- nice, reasonable size for European standards, but not totally special. We met folks on the 23rd floor (not executive). They had free internet in their room,- ours was $20 per day. I still can't figure out why (and we are Hilton Honors members!) As others have said, the beds are somewhat hard. However, they are not so hard as to prevent you from crashing after walking around Tokyo all day. The location is close to the metro, with an underground walkway to one station and a free shuttle bus that takes you to the Shinjuku station. I am not sure that I would necessarily stay in the Shinjuku area on a return visit, as the Hilton is in a business district. However, with metro access you could easily get anywhere. One down side of this hotel is the unbelievably high price of it's breakfast lounge. Breakfasts are $38 here. Most people I met walked one block to the Dennys or the Royal Host coffee shop and had breakfast for under $10. Also,between 4 and 6 PM the hotel had a dessert bar in the lounge with a chocolate fountain. However, that too was $38- which was too high of a price for a snack for this poor American... Finally, the concierge service is available 24/7. They aren't extraordinary but they were helpful to provide maps and very basic recommendations. 
In all, I would recommend this hotel if you can get it for a good price or as part of a package.",4,2009/11/13
1,REDACTED,en,3096,"I spent a long time planning my trip to Tokyo, eventually narrowing it down to the Park Hotel in Shiodome which has received numerous positive reviews on Tripadvisor, and this hotel. 

Inspired by Lost in Translation - but not able to afford the Park Hyatt – I opted for the Hilton, which is just along the road. 

I booked an Executive Room which included access to the Executive Lounge (free breakfast, drinks and snacks), gym/pool access, and free internet. I found this to be very good value for money at just over 140GBP a night – more than I would normally spend on a hotel in Europe, say – but a very competitive rate for a quality four star hotel in Tokyo with all these services included. 

We took the Airport Limousine Bus from Narita to the hotel – really simple to use - out of arrivals and the Airport Limousine Bus counter is facing you. At around 20GBP one way it’s a very convenient and affordable door to door service. If you want to take a taxi be prepared for a massive dent in your wallet - you’re looking at an astronomical fare of 150GBP plus!

The room was ready when we arrived at midday and they let us check in straight away. I found the reception staff to be friendly and courteous. In fact, all the staff we came across here were very polite - bowing, smiling and helpful. 

Our room was on the 37th floor with views over the tower blocks of Shinjuku. (The roads are incredibly clean – the markings look like they are repainted daily!) 

The room décor was light and bright, contemporary yet simple - it could be a hotel room anywhere in the world - but I liked the paper screens on the window, a nice Japanese touch. 

The room was spacious enough, with sufficient cupboard space for a 5 night stay, and all the usual amenities you’d expect: safe, iron, mini-bar, bottles of water and tea/coffee facilities. There was a large flat screen TV – just a few basic English language channels - but some there are some interesting things on Japanese TV that’s for sure! 

The bathroom isn’t huge, but it’s bright with an anti fog mirror. There was good shower pressure, plenty hot water and a funky Japanese toilet – complete with built in fountain (it’s an ‘interesting’ experience!) There’s an extensive range of toiletries (more than you really need!) which are replenished daily. 

The Executive Lounge is also on the 37th floor, with panoramic views of the city. It’s not massive but it’s spacious enough - there is lots of seating and it never felt busy – calm and relaxing. Breakfast is served here daily with a good selection of western and Japanese items. Later in the day, afternoon tea is served, and there are cocktails in the evening. We were always out during the day, so unfortunately missed these on all but one night!

The hotel has a number of restaurants and a great little patisserie although the pumpkin cheesecake is an acquired taste! There are loads of other eateries in the vicinity – lots of local restaurants plus the likes of Burger King, Denny’s and Starbucks.

Tokyo is huge. The metro may look like a bowl of coloured spaghetti at first glance, but it’s actually really simple and very efficient. You can get to the Metro system from the hotel basement – although it’s a good 5 minute walk through an underground passageway) A rechargeable PASAMO card is a very wise investment and can be bought from the ticket machines at the station.

1,REDACTED,en,3097,"Apart from the very convenient location in Shinjuku (walking distance to 2 subway stations - E & M lines, and to shopping centres like Isetan and Mitsukoshi), what really makes this hotel special is the warm, impeccable service. From the gracious and friendly check-in staff, efficient concierge who made our dinner reservations and saw us off onto the airport bus, and warm porters who showed us to our room and pointed out where Mount Fuji could be seen on a clear day, the service is attentive, seamless and genuine.

When we asked for directions for supper, he wasn't very helpful either.

Rooms are clean and good size considering this is Tokyo.

1,REDACTED,en,3107,"Nice hotel for business traveler, but If you are just a tourist then the location could be little bit to far from activity center. Tokyo is a walking city and by the end of the day it could be rather difficult to walk extra 15-25 mins or wait for free shuttle bus (but, surely, taxi at JY 700 -1000 from Shinjuku station are ready available).

The room was comfortable with very (and I mean VERY) small bathroom (with traditional washlet). The design of the room is pretty much standard with almost no touch of Japan (except paper blinds on windows). Nice restaurants, especially good is the seafood buffet (around JY 6,500 per person). Breakfast in the lobby was good, but very ordinary with no changes in menu for a week while we stayed there. 

As for my personal feeling – nice hotel, but so ordinary and impersonal that I have no intention to stay there again.",4,2009/09/05
1,REDACTED,en,3108,"Stayed at the Tokyo Hilton for 3 nights in an executive room. Hotel room was stylish and really large, bed a little hard, bathroom was small but had everything you needed. The hotel is about a 3 to 5 minute leisurely walk to Nishi-Shinjuku station via subway tunnel from the hotel or a shuttle from the hotel to the main Shinjuku station. The evening cocktails and nibbles in the executive lounge was a great way to start the evening. The buffet breakfast in the Marble Lounge was good with lots of choice - western and asian foods. Not a lot around the hotel in the way of restaurants but about a 10 minute walk will get you into the busy section of Shinjuku. Really enjoyed our stay.",4,2009/09/02
1,REDACTED,en,3109,"The room was modern and larger than most I have stayed in in Japan. The The location is above a subway station so you can easily get to any location in Tokyo, and the hotel provides a free shuttle bus service to and from the Shinjuku department stores. concierge service was outstanding, very helpful with maps, directions and suggestions and excellent English skills. Tepanyaki restaurant was a great experience with excellent food - a bit expensive but first class Tepanyaki chefs make it a great night out. The service from staff across all parts of this hotel was really great, very helpful and friendly. I'd definitely stay here again.",5,2009/09/01
1,REDACTED,en,3110,"This was a last minute trip so we booked with Hilton as the rates were very reasonable for the Shinjuku area. I had a great HIlton agent, she found a rate code that's lower than the airline crew rate, the nightly rate was quoted around USD $130.00 before tax. I'm not sure how the agent did it but it was confirmed.

I'd say the hotel service is excellent but will rate it as 4 because I only checked-in and out, and not a problem asking for a late check-out (2:00pm), I'm also a Hilton Honors member.

The lobby is nicely decorated, there's also a pharmacy on the same floor which I didn't realize until it was closed, my fault for not paying attention. 

The room was okay, size was decent for a two night stay but I thought the furniture was a bit dated, hence maybe the low rates? The bathroom was fun, err..what I meant was the toilet had one of those washer/bidet, I've forgotten how nice it is to have one to use. I'll spare the details.

In the room, slippers, robes, complimentary tea, electric hot water thermos, LCD TV, and sad to say no free internet, it'll cost around USD $17.00 for a 24 hour period.

Not much more I can say about the room, it's great if you get a good deal but if you had to pay closer to USD $180.00 per night, I'd say look somewhere else.

Quick tip: When arriving into Narita Airport, after customs and you've just stepped out into the passenger arrival area and need internet access, walk towards the ANA check-in/ticket counter, they have free internet access, let your laptop find the signal and connect! It's great if you need last minute checking of whatever.

This time we took the JR train (non-express) from Narita Airport into Tokyo, transferred at the Tokyo Station to Shinjuku Station, roughly around USD $15.00 per person. The bus for Tokyo hotels was about USD $34.00 per person and maybe 30 minutes faster or just as long pending traffic.

The Shinjuku Station is perhaps the busiest in the Tokyo area, be ready for the crowds!

There is a complimentary Hilton Shuttle Bus between Shinjuku Station and the Hotel. The schedule is 00, 20, 40 of the hour. Bus stop number 21, right outside the department store. This is a nice department store, the lower level is all about food!

The hotel is located in an area not exactly close to the main strip, you'll need to walk a few blocks, once you're oriented in your bearings you might opt walking to Shinjuku Station versus taking the complimentary Hilton Shuttle Bus unless you have your luggage with you. By walking you'll get to pass by many little stores, shops and if you need a comfort zone ""Starbucks""

Don't be alarmed with the noise, not from traffic but from the bugs...Cicadas! You would never believe the noise coming out of these little monsters! The bulk of the noise is concentrated in the park nearby. 

For such a short trip, we did locals things; fish market (get there early), Imperial Palace, Akasuka, Temples, a little shopping. Like I said earlier this was a last minute jet set trip as we have reservations at the Westin Princeville in Kauai in a couple of days (read my write-up if you get a chance).

It's cheaper to get a day pass for getting around on the local train, around USD $10.00 per adult. On our way back to the airport we continued to use the day pass to the Tokyo Station then bought the JR (non-Express) ticket to the airport which was about USD $12.00 per person. Make sure you ask for ""non-express"" it's much cheaper and about 30 minutes slower, I think the agents automatically default to ""express"" and the ticket was much, much more!

Oh, one more thing...observe their custom especially when taking the train.",3,2009/08/30
1,REDACTED,en,3111,"As a HHonors Gold member, I would expect to be treated better. NO WAY! Booked a Junior Suite and did in fact given what I booked but it's on the 12th floor looking the back side. The hotel has 38-story with 32-38 are executive floors. I didn't even make half-way up the hotel! Got to endure neighbors belonging to a tour group from Hong Kong. I was feeling the need of injecting them with Propofol! The only perks given are breakfast coupons-not at the executive lounge up top but at the lobby restaurant. We had to stand in line for 3 straight mornings to be seated. I wrote to complained and the management only replied with ""Now we know that you had not nice stay and I would like to redevelop our good relationship with you. I will keep it in our record and do our best to accommodate you to higher floor on your next visit.."" Yeah, as if I will come back next time and get screwed again? Although the hotel is in Shinjuku, it's actually not that convenient. It takes at least 15 mins to walk to the JR Shinjuku. The shuttle which runs :30 stop around 9:30p so if you're planning on staying out late, don't count on the free bus. For $275/night, this place is overpriced with its outdated rooms and nonexistant service. This is the first trip I took with my parents in 12 years and I felt so embarassed having them to stay in a joint like this. With 800+ rooms, you are treated just as a number.",1,2009/08/26

The reception and staff, all very friendly and professional.

1,REDACTED,en,3113,"Stayed in the Hilton after getting a great deal on an Executive Room from Expedia. It meant that you could use the Executive Lounge which had free internet, had a few nice cocktails and sandwiches in the evening. However, it is packed at breakfast so I recommend that you go to the normal breakfast lounge downstairs which is spacious and frankly, has better choice. The staff in the Executive Lounge, like in the reception, tried to be nice and helpful but did suffer from a little bit of cluelessness on occasion. For example, we were put in a smoking room even though requesting a non-smoking room which was a bit unpleasant and one staff member told me at 5.59pm that I couldn't have a sandwich that was sitting out until 6pm!! He even scuttled over to tell me that I could have it now seconds later!! Plus the bar staff in the St George Bar were nice but pretty clueless about what beer they served. Don't let that put you off though, if you are patient and like to go with the flow then this is a nice hotel.
There are plenty of restaurants ranging from American (Denny's anyone?) to local (the Japanese Spaghetti place nearby is popular) so you really don't have to go far for some food- check out the underground mall 5 minutes walk away towards Shinjuku Station.

The bus shuttle into Shinjuku is great although it could do with running a little bit later if you are out having some fun in the centre and can't face a taxi fare.

All in all, give it a try. They try hard and even though they miss the mark on a few small things, it was a pleasant stay for us.",4,2009/08/11
1,REDACTED,en,3114,"I stayed in the Tokyo Hilton for three nights in July. I stay in Hiltons quite frequently, and came away from this one with a poor impression. I am a gold card member, but they did not provide an upgrade to the executive floor on check-in (as is usually the case), so I was given a ""deluxe room"". The room itself was so-so, reasonable size for Japan and quite modern. The bathroom was awful - small, 80's style with an unpleasant smell. Internet was $18 per day (would have been free in the executive level). The hotel felt crowded and service was generally poor by Japanese standards. Breakfast was standard Hilton buffet, but for some reason most of the food tasted poor. It was by some distance the worst food I ate during my trip to Japan. I would not stay here again - you can do much better in Tokyo.",2,2009/07/25
1,REDACTED,en,3115,"My partner and I stayed had a pleasant 5 night stay at the Hilton. We came from Hyatt Kyoto via the JR train to Shinjuku station. When we hopped off the train, no taxi would take us to the hotel – probably because they didn’t want to lose their place in line for a short taxi ride to the hotel. The Shinjuku station help desk kindly told us that there are shuttle buses to and from the hotel outside the station near Keio. Therefore, if you’re coming from Narita airport, take the limousine bus to the Hilton, and if you’re taking the JR train, take the shuttle bus from Shinjuku station.

Upon arrival, staff are ready to greet you and will kindly take your bags while you check in. We were given a free upgrade to a junior suite and if we joined Hilton HHonors we were given a late check out of 3pm.

We were taken to the 20th level and the room was HUGE, even by western standards. Although the room was lovely, the bathroom was quite average. It certainly did not match the room and is in need of a renovation.

The hotel is connected to the metro line which is just a few minutes walk away. Shinjuku station is probably about a 10 – 15 minute walk away but it would be easier if you take the shuttle bus as it departs every 20 minutes to and from Shinjuku which is very convenient. 

There was wifi in the room - however at an expensive rate charged for each 24 hours. This is quite ridiculous as we were not going to use the internet for 24 hours straight. They should charge by the hour, but I guess this is how it is done.

Buffet breakfast was included in our accommodation and it was just lovely. A wide selection of food was available and coffee and juices were included also. It was well worth waking up for. On Sundays it gets quite busy as breakfast is extended to 11am (usually till 10.30). There are also many restaurants available on the 2nd floor.

The concierge and staff were very friendly and helpful. We needed to post something in the mail, and the hotel staff kindly did that for us. They provided helpful directions and maps to places (such as Disneyland which I highly recommend). 

Overall I had a very satisfactory stay and the only disappointment was the bathroom.",5,2009/07/22
1,REDACTED,en,3116,"Got a two night for the price of one deal for the executive floor which was great value at US$350 all in. The hotel is 5 minutes walk from two metro stations and just under 10 minutes walk from the larger Shinjuku station. These stations make it easy to explore Tokyo and there are plenty of shops and restaurants within an easy walk of the hotel if not actual ""sights"".

We tried to check in at 3.30pm and were asked if we were checking out! It seems that check out / check in times are late in the day here as our rooms were not ready. After a 30 minute wait in the executive lounge we got our rooms. The rooms were a good size by European standards but not executive sized by some standards. Wired broadband is fast and no charge.

Tried out the gym which is complimentary if you have an executive room but if not, outrageously, at additional cost. The gym is small for the size of the hotel but was fairly quiet, perhaps its Hilton Tokyo's policy to price out guests who might want to use the gym. There was also a small indoor swimming pool and a Japanese bath/sauna.

The executive lounge offers a good selection of drinks and canapes between 6pm and 8pm which we enjoyed. The lounge got busy so get there early to find a table. 

Didn't have dinner in the hotel but tried late night drinks in the ground floor bar. After signing the bill I notice that we had been charged Y1,300 per person cover charge! We queried this given the very mediocre piano/cello players in the corner who hardly justified any cover charge and were told it was a mistake by the barman, as we were in executive rooms there was no cover charge. The whole episode gave a poor impression.

Breakfast in the executive lounge was good. Again the lounge was very busy so don't arrive late to get a table without waiting.

After our ""late"" check in we were offered a ""late"", 2pm, check out.

Would stay again in an executive room at the right price but would not stay in a non-executive room unless the hotel recognises that it is completely unjustified to charge guests extra for use of the gym/pool and hotel bar. In my opinion this is absolutely unacceptable and very underhand by the hotel - they should be more open and honest about the extra charges they impose!",4,2009/07/20
1,REDACTED,en,3117,"Hilton Tokyo looks like high level luxury hotel in Shinjuku area. The room was modern and clean and the breakfast was very good.

The hotel management and Tokyo Police were helpful but this kind of things should never happen in Hilton. The hotel gave no compensation to us. Unfortunately I can't recommend this place for anyone.

1,REDACTED,en,3118,"As I sit down to write this review, having just stayed in the Hilton Tokyo this past weekend, I was surprised to see all of the glowing reviews affirming this as one of the top hotels in Tokyo. Of the several (granted, generally nice) hotels in Japan I've stayed in over the past few weeks, this was one of the least enjoyable, owing to the following:

1) the downstairs reception/lobby area was at all times very crowded and noisy, especially with the contending buffet area alongside, and bags at all times lined up on carriers in various sections either awaiting check-in, airport transfer, etc. This common area seems not adequately designed, spacially or acoustically, for the heavy traffic, or at least comfortably so.
2) despite arriving at 4pm (well after check-in time), we were made to wait 20 minutes for our room. And there was no place to sit while waiting (see #1).
3) rooms were very average, with bathrooms in particular lacking much of any attractiveness that I would expect in a hotel of this stature (this being rated in comparison to various other Tokyo hotels I've stayed in).

With this said, the hotel is in a very desirable location in Shinjuku, with much within walking distance, including the Shinjuku station (though you may prefer to take the free shuttle), Park Hyatt for drinks. Buffet breakfast was included in our room rate and, aside from weaving through the masses to fill the plate, the food and service was overall very good.",3,2009/07/12
1,REDACTED,en,3119,"I tend to stay in Hilton hotels a lot on business, but this one was a real gem. I was upgraded to the executive floors, which gave my wife and me a somewhat nicer room and access to the executive lounge. The room was modern, attractively decorated, comfortable, and impeccably clean. The bed was quite comfortable. The room had a large window with an interesting view of the city. The bathroom was a bit small, but bright, clean, efficient, and functional, with a great shower and Japanese style toilet/bidet. I really looked forward to the excellent breakfast buffet each morning in the executive lounge. The exercise/fitness facilities were first rate. The concierge and hotel staff were uniformly helpful and friendly. The hotel's meeting facilities were better than a lot of other places I've stayed. The hotel is a short distance from Shinjuku station, and there are regular, free shuttles run by the Hilton and other nearby hotels between them and the station.

1,REDACTED,en,3124,"I have reviewed this hotel once before and just wanted to give them Kudos again for the outstanding job that they are continuing to do. I stayed at the hotel from 30 May until 12 June for a large trade show. Typically 80% of the trade show participants stay across the street at the Hyatt, with 10% at the Hilton, and the other bargain-conscious 10% spread amongst the discount joints throughout Shinjuku such as the New City Hotel across Shinjuku-Chuo Park from the Hyatt. This hotel has no shortcomings as far as I can tell. I have read the reviews about the executive club being crowded and poorly managed, but I found just the opposite. It was only crowded once on a Saturday where we had to wait for seating,and the staff and management are outstanding. Incredibly attentive service for a club. Exceptional bartenders with a full range of premium liquors and excellent food make this club the finest that I have ever experienced at a Hilton. The Regency Club at the Hyatt across the street has a very limited liquor selection and doesn't have a bartender, and their food selection is far less than the Hilton's. The fitness facilities and pool are far better than the Hyatt's with the fitness center being at least three times bigger than the Hyatt's. The very best thing about the fitness center are the huge ""onsen-style"" gigantic hot baths (like giant jacuzzis) with accompanying cold baths and sauna. There is no better way to wind-down from a hard day's work or tough workout than an extended soak in this wonderful bath with a few cool dips or sauna sessions interspersed! Food at the restaurants that we tried was outstanding if somewhat pricey--but hey, it is Tokyo and everything in a first-class hotel is expensive. Housekeeping staff were always quick and efficient and quickly adapted to my odd trade show schedule. Another great advantage of the Hilton over the Hyatt is the powerful aircon units: For 15 years I always stayed at the Hyatt for my trade show and could never get the room cool enough, but at the Hilton, I can make the room as cool as I want, winter or summer. The concierge desk was superb and took hours helping me with a customs problem on my trade show shipment. This is a truly wonderful hotel and outstanding in every way.

1,REDACTED,en,3127,"Set your expectations folks. This is Japan and space is a premium. This hotel is first rate, but the rooms at first glance are small. The bathrooms are also tiny, fetauring a tub shower and small sink area.

Service in the hotel is stellar, the staff exceedingly polite. I was bowed to death by any staff member, literally, and you can see they mean to be polite. The Executive lounge is very nice, spacious, and offers check in on the 37th floor. Breakfast is good and had many food variety options. I originally was opting for the Hilton Narita, and when it was not available chose this property. It is a solid 1 hour bus ride direct to the hotel from Narita via the 'Friendly' shuttle, aka the Orange Bus. Use the Orange Bus..It is quick, cheap (35$ us one way) and efficient.

1,REDACTED,en,3136,"On arrival, after a long flight from the UK via Helsinki, we had to wait for two hours for our room to be ready. This was to be expected. The staff looked after our luggage and took it to our room. This gave us a chance to explore the area around the hotel. We were stunned by the beauty of the cherry blossom in a nearby park, the friendly faces of the locals and the spotless nature of the streets. We were obviously in the middle of a distinctly business district of the city. The office blocks were amazing to gaze up at.
When we received keys for our room we were not disappointed. The room was spacious with a wonderful king sized bed and a fantastic view from the 21st floor looking over Shinjuku. The bathroom was compact with bath and shower together - nothing too plush here, but then we weren't planning to spend the week in a bathroom.
The staff were exceptional. Checking in and out was dealt with efficiently and in a friendly manner. The lady at the front entrance was extremely helpful with luggage. The concierge was very professional in directing us to places. The reception area of the hotel is very spacious and plush. The 'Hiltopia' shopping area beneath the hotel also looked very impressive. There was a walkway to the nearby metro station here as well. 
All in all, we were very satisfied with our hotel - its cleanliness, its staff, the facilities and its location were all to our liking.
The city itself is fantastic. We chose a different area each day that would incorporate the natural and the man made - mainly parks and buildings. We would thoroughly recommend a walk through Shinjuku at night - very safe and very colourful. Ueno Park is beautiful, especially in Spring with the cherry blossom on the trees. The Senso - ji temple area in Asakasa was amazing, including the numerous shopping streets nearby. There are some fantastic views from the observation floor in the Tokyo Metropolitan Government complex near the hotel. We would also recommend a cruise in the Tokyo Harbour area. Due to the poor exchange rate at the moment, food and drinks were expensive so we couldn't really splash out on a fancy restaurant. Whilst you obviously don't get to see much of the city, the Metro is still recommended - it's extremely efficient, spotless and safe. 
You could not fault the manners of the people. The respect shown for foreign visitors and locals alike is something every English person should see and learn from!",5,2009/04/14
1,REDACTED,en,3137,"I don’t intend to say Hilton Tokyo is a bad hotel, just that it didn’t manage to reach the very high level of typical Asian 4/5 star hotel. So expectations were higher than what I received. Three star review is probably little bit too strict, but on the other hand there quite much better hotels in my four star review list so cannot go higher… As a concrete example Hilton Osaka was clearly better in many aspects. 

Location:
Location is surrounded by high office buildings, main restaurants/bars/shops are in the other part of Shinjuku (~15min walk). There are some restaurants in the basement of the building next door though (multiple Japanese, Burger King, Italian place, Indian place and a very decent Kirin bar). 

There’s a complimentary shuttle bus to Shinjuku station but its completely reasonable distance to take a walk. 

Room:
Had a junior suite in 17th floor. Room was clearly bigger than a regular one, based on floor plan it was almost double the size. So certainly enough for me as a single traveler. Room was very clean and had been renovated some time ago. Bathroom on the other hand did show some signs from 80s. TV was a smallish LCD screen and there was the normal equipment such as safe box. 

I didn’t notice any particular Japanese theme in the hotel, except in the room windows there curtains were replaced by traditional looking wood/rice paper blinds. Which was small but nice touch. 

Service: 
Service was not quite up to the normal very high Asian luxury hotel standards. For example according to the normal Hilton rules a HHonors Diamond member is always allowed to use Executive Lounge, regardless of whether staying in Executive Floor or not. That was not the case in this hotel, I was asked to choose between lounge access and buffet breakfast. This might sound like very minor thing, but those minor things are really the ones making difference in this level between 4/5 star hotels. Oh and didn’t receive any upgrade either (didn’t expect one though). 

Lounge was rather large and had quite good offering, including cocktails (between 6pm and 8pm). Instead of champagne they were serving sparkling wine, rather unusual I have to say in this kind of executive class lounge. 

Etc: 
Breakfast downstairs didn’t officially start until 06:30, but we had to leave every morning at 06:30 in order to catch the train to the other side of huge Tokyo city for business meetings. So we came in already at 06:00 and ate whatever was available then, normally everything but hot food was already in place. There were quite many other people doing the same, so perhaps an official start at 06:00 would be in order based on demand? 

Tried the lobby restaurant once, Hilton Burger was very average and quite expensive. Beer was very expensive. Breakfast was, on the other hand, quite good with very extensive selection. So no complaints there. 

Didn’t try pool or gym so cannot comment them. 

Value for money was not the best here since hotel is quite expensive! 

Would I return there?
If I’m ever in Shinjuku area again I could consider returning, but would certainly look for other alternatives first",3,2009/04/12
1,REDACTED,en,3138,"Agree with many other posters that the Shinjuku location is good. This is a large hotel that seems to cater to groups on the weekend, many of whom are going to Tokyo Disneyland.

At check in, was not offered an upgrade even though I am Gold level. When I asked about the executive floor, I was given a blank look and asked ""why do you need that?"" Concierge was proficient at doling out a map, but not too helpful on actual directions which are an absolute necessity in Tokyo since most streets are not named and addresses are pretty much nonexistent. Staff seemed perpetually too busy to answer simple questions. I used points for this stay so I cannot complain too much since my stay was essentially free, but certainly didn't get the warm fuzzies here.

Breakfast was pretty good.

Shuttle to Shinjuku station runs about every 20 minutes but be prepared to lift and load your own luggage while a swarm of people push by to get on the bus.

Overall good location, comfortable rooms, and good breakfast. Not much personal service though.",3,2009/04/10
1,REDACTED,en,3139,This hotel is located within easy walking distance of Shinjuku station and is a comfortable place to stay with friendly staff. I do think it is very expensive though - nearly 1000 yen for a simple coffee or water.,4,2009/04/09
1,REDACTED,en,3140,"We booked two rooms (twin and triple) at the Hilton Tokyo for three nights. The hotel stay was part of a package booked from a travel agent in Hong Kong (and was quite inexpensive). Our room was an older style one, which appears in a few (but not most) of the pictures shown on tripadvisor.

We walked to the hotel from Shinjuku station, the signs are very clear and we had no problem finding it, although the walk is a bit long at about 15 mins.

Check-in at the hotel went very smoothly and we were up in our rooms in no time. After settling down we approached the concierge for directions and maps. On all occasions, the assistance of the concierge was far beyond any expectations. They really want to help and make your trip enjoyable, and offered many valuable suggestions. But what I appreciated most is that they didn't push us to overpriced tourist traps as I feared they might (and happens in other countries). I am really thankful for their help and smiles. The concierge sells Tokyo Metro day passes so no need to scramble when you get to the station. Nishi-Shinjuku station is only about a five minute walk away.

We explored the local area in the evening and were able to find many inexpensive restaurants with good quality food. Very few speak English in these small restaurants, but it is never a problem as people were always so polite and helpful, pointing and gesturing always seemed to get the point across after a few tries. Don't be afraid to try local restaurants even if you don't speak a word of Japanese.

The rooms are quite dated, but in good condition. Cleanliness was quite good, espescially considering that they probably hadn't been updated in over 10 years. The beds were quite comfortable, and overall the size of the room was quite reasonable.

Overall we had a very enjoyable stay, in large part due to the very friendly and helpful staff! A big thank you from all of us!",4,2009/04/08

The service is by far the best of my trip. They make it their prerogative to make your stay a nice one. Rooms are large and clean for what you expect however the bath size isn't as large as I thought (can't fit 2 people into it but thats just being picky).

There is a limosine bus service to the Airports.
There is a complimentary bus to Shinjuku rail station which is a convenient drop off point to go out for dinner or explore.

My only sour taste was that you did not get free broadband (which I did get at other hotels I stayed at in Tokyo). The hotel is very clean and the staff are great.
The gym is good but again this was not complimentary.
The food was ok but you can get better food at better prices out and about in Shinjuku.
The breakfast was great.",4,2009/03/20
1,REDACTED,en,3143,"This was my third visit to this hotel. We were warmly welcomed after a delayed journey from the Airport. I was prewarned when I bought the bus ticket at the airport that it would take longer than the usual 90 mins ish and it took exactly the extra time. The return was fine. As a Gold VIP I was upgraded on this occasion, not previously. I was given breakfast vouchers and also benefited from free internet access in my room.

The room was big enough with a fine bathroom, the beds also comfortable, The essential aircon functioned perfectly in July, essential! I believe Japanese style bedrooms are available. Concierge was most helpful with a couple of items.

I like this area and the hotel has easy access to 2 subway lines and also the often mentioned free bus to the main huge Station and shopping area. As with many hotel shuttle buses in Japan I would avoid using these if you have much luggage as there is often very little room for it.

The breakfast available in the Marble Lounge was excellent with either style available and an efficient egg station.",4,2009/03/18
1,REDACTED,en,3144,"This is my second time over a two year period at the Hilton in Shinjuku and our stay proved that the quality is consistent. 

There are so many great things to say about this hotel that it's kind of hard to know where to start! 

The location couldn't be better. Aside from having a spectacular view of the Shinjuku skyline (and it's glorious at night), the hotel is right on the subway line (Nishi-Shinjuku) and just down the street from Shinjuku Station which is a major starting point for just about everything in Tokyo. 

The staff and concierge service are wonderful. They were friendly, spoke English well and were helpful with all our questions. 

The rooms are comfortable, very clean and well thought out. Nothing overly fancy, but enough room for two people to be content with natural colors and bright lighting. The bedding is glorious if you like down though I found the bed to be a bit hard. The television doesn't have many English channels (HBO, CNN and BBC), but that seems to be standard for Japan. We hooked up our laptop with an AV cable and watched movies. Our floor had free wireless which wasn't slow or buggy so we were easily kept entertained when we were in the room.

The workout facilities are extremely nice. If you like tennis, there are two lovely courts outside. Inside, you'll find a pool and other standard gym equipment. I especially liked the locker room which had a sauna and a hot tub - great after a long day of sightseeing. 

Both times I've stayed here, I've opted for the Executive level which is perfect if you like a good breakfast and enjoy food throughout the day. The Executive Lounge is probably the best amenity in the entire hotel and well worth the extra price considering how expensive eating in Tokyo can be. The food is delicious, the service excellent and you won't find a nicer cocktail hour (champagne anyone??). The place is usually packed so get there early and grab a window seat to enjoy the views. 

Drawbacks? No coffee maker in the room! A small complaint but we got up early one morning and found the only place to get coffee was in the main lobby at 900 yen a cup. Pretty pricey and our waiter filled us up once and we didn't see him again.

Overall, I can't say enough good things about the place. If you're not wanting over the top luxury, but luxury none the less, you'll find it here.",5,2009/03/17

1,REDACTED,en,3146,"This was my first trip to Tokyo and I had a lot of apprehensions. I was told that hotel rooms in Tokyo were overpriced and small. When checking in we were upgraded to the Executive Floors. This included access to the Executive Lounge which provided morning breakfast, afternoon tea, evening happy hour and all day snacks.
Our room was not huge, but bigger than the Hilton in New York City, and certainly comfortable for the two of us. We were provided slippers, robes, and comfy Yukatas (Japanese kimono). The bathroom was small, but well appointed with a bidet. The room was well insulated for sound. We never heard the sounds of the street or of the other guests.
What impressed me the most about this hotel was the staff. Everyone was helpful. While my husband checked in, three staff members offered to help me. The concierge provided me with excellent suggestions and directions to local sites. The maid service was prompt and efficient. 
The breakfast was wonderful. Every morning we feasted on rice, miso, veggies, salmon, and green tea. There were lots of western options for breakfast too.
The exercise facility was well equipped and the pool was wonderful.

Though it was a little far west from the main Shinjuku train station & shopping/dining district, it was a comfortable, hospitable ""home base"" for my travels around Tokyo. While the nearby Starbucks was a more affordable option, the hotel's breakfast buffet is worth a try given its breadth & quality. The hotel's jazz club was a little pricey but low-key and memorable. Overall, the service & experience were top-notch for Hilton. I hope to return soon.",4,2009/02/22
1,REDACTED,en,3148,"This Hilton is a nice and very big Hilton Hotel. The staff was very competent and the hotel was nice.

We stayed on the executive floors because of the free internet and drinks. We also booked a package that provided breakfast which was also provided by staying on the executive floor. 

The breakfast downstairs was very good, large, and had great variety of foods (Japanese breakfast as well as Western breakfast). I definitely recommend eating breakfast downstairs in the Marble Lounge.

We ate dinner one night in the Japanese restaurant and, although the food was good, it was at least 10,000-15,000 yen more expensive than a comparable meal would have been in a good local restaurant. That is to be expected in a hotel, however, in hindsight, I would have eaten somewhere else.

The downstairs concierge was very good and made reservations at the office building across the street for dinner one of the nights we were there and the dinner was great, moderately priced, and the view was amazing. Even if you are staying on the executive floor, use the down stairs concierge and not the executive floor staff. The downstairs concierges are a little more savvy at figuring out what the traveler is trying to accomplish. 

The room was small but fine. The bathroom was much smaller than one would expect but not a big problem. Later in our trip we stayed at the Conrad Hotel in Tokyo and the bathrooms were gigantic at the Conrad in comparison to the Hilton.

The proximity to the metro station (connected to hotel by underground) was very helpful as well. We were able to get around Tokyo very well. Plus they have a shuttle to the Shinjuku Railway Station which takes you connects you to the entire country.

Overall, a fine stay.",4,2009/02/16
1,REDACTED,en,3149,"The Hilton Tokyo is an easy fifteen minute walk from Shinjuku Station or a 5-6 minute shuttle bus ride. (Take the West Exit from the station to go to the shuttle bus stop.)

The hotel's location in the heart of the Shinjuku business district is probably what explains its high rates, because when it comes down to a careful evaluation of the hotel, it is a typical Hilton property with standard rooms. I booked my room on the Hilton web site, but later found a cheaper rate through Orbitz. I tried to take advantage of the Hilton web site ""low price guarantee"" but they have so many requirements to qualify for the guarantee that they were able to wiggle out of honoring it.

I booked my room through Hilton's website because I am a member of the Hilton Honors program. But despite being a diamond level member, I was placed in a standard room on both of my stays in January. Other than getting Hilton Honors credit for your stay, I can find no other benefit to booking through Hilton, so if you want to stay at this property at a more economical rate, I would advise shopping around at other sites.

The rooms are quiet, comfortable and well designed. The hotel underwent a major renovation recently, so the rooms have a ""new"" feel to them, although the decor is bland and uninteresting. The beds are very comfortable and the down comforters are a perfect weight; not too heavy, not too hot. The housekeeping is flawless. The rooms have flat screen televisions, but no dvd player or ipod docking capabilities. In-room internet service is provided at a rate of Y1680/24 hours.

The bathrooms are small, plain, and the amenities are just the standard ones found in most all Japanese hotels. I was a little disappointed that there was only one bar of soap to be shared between the wash basin and the bath. The towels are also standard issue.

The hotel's restaurants are excellent, but expensive. I use an informal ""Hilton Burger"" index to compare restaurant rates from Hilton Hotel to Hilton Hotel. At Y2000, it's an expensive hamburger.

The hotel's overall service level is excellent. It's consistently enthusiastic and efficient. 

In sum, the Hilton Tokyo is a well-run, typical Hilton Hotel in an excellent location, but at a steep price.",4,2009/02/04

1,REDACTED,en,3151,"Hilton Tokyo is in an excellent location/Shinjuku, just an underground walk to 2 different subway stations.

Many reviewers rate the Hyatt across the street higher, but I can't imagine why???

This Hilton is just the right size and has all of the ammenities that anyone would need, including 5 restaurants and an Executive Club.

The staff is attentive and friendly and makes every effort to make you feel at home.

We had a ""standard-plus"" room (1824), which is a bit larger than a regular standard room. Appointed nicely with a flat screen TV and all of the creature comforts.

The bed is typically Japanese... firm, but comfortable.

The bathroom is small by any standards, but features nice lighting and a big bathtub. The toilet is high tech, doubling as a bidet and washer.

The view was also nice.

Tokyo is expensive and the Hilton is no exception. The food and wine will certainly set you back. Values within the hotel include ""Checkers"" on the second floor, with a good buffet. Their ""wine buffet"" is also the best bang for the buck in the hotel.

A big hit was room service. Everything ordered was fantastic! Recommened- Herb Crusted Lamb and the Noodle Soup with Seafood. 

Outside of the hotel, we recommend a short walk to Isetan Market. There you will find a supermarket and a gourmet deli area with some terrific prepared foods. It is also a great place to practice your newly learned Japanese phrases on some of the locals. 

Japan has no tipping and this is very welcome when ordering food, or taking a taxi.

The free shuttle bus to Shinjuku's main train station from the Hilton is also a nice touch, should you be travelling outside of Tokyo, or anywhere on the JR (train) Line. A great day trip is a 55 minute train ride to Kamakura. This is a mini-Kyoto, with temples, shopping and a giant Buddah. Also try the Yanaka area, just outside of the Nippori Station for more temples, a Buddah, and a large cemetary with the graves of some Japan's famous Shoguns and celebrities.

Both the train and subway are extremely user-friendly with English instructions.

Attached to the Hilton is ""Hiltopia,"" their shopping mall with restaurants and shops galore.

Returning to the airport is a 90-minute breeze on the Limo-Bus. Pickup is at the Hilton and costs Y3000 per person.

1,REDACTED,en,3152,"This was a free-and-easy holiday for the family, as we had been to Tokyo before on a guided tour, but we found that we didn't have enough time at the places we liked.

On searching both hotel and hotel booking websites, it seems a bit complicated as many of the Japanese chain charge per person rather than per room. Also, many of them would not allow a triple or 2 adults & 1 child, I suppose maybe due to the small sizes of the rooms.

As time was running out, I had to bite the bullet and book at the Hilton, and with a credit card deal, got a junior suite (non-executive floor) with breakfast. However, the price per night was almost US$400.

At check-in, we were given breakfast vouchers only for the 2 adults. When questioned, the staff said that this was the standard rate, even though the booking was for 2 adults and a child and I also had an additional foldable bed for the child. They did give me the child's breakfast vouchers in the end, but only after I made some noise about it. You won't expect my child to go out and eat on his own, and the child's rate at the hotel breakfast was about US$40 !!!

The room itself was excellent and spacious, it faced the back and had a partial view of the Shinjuku Garden. The garden is just across the junction from the hotel, making it convienient for a morning stroll. Room amenities were also complete, and there was enough space for my child to run around.

The hotel breakfast was great and very comprehensive, covering both Japanese and Western tastes. The service staff were very attentive, and my child made friends with the omelette chef. Our first morning there coincided with a Japanese public holiday, and the breakfast area was very crowded with a long queue to wait. But the staff were still very polite and actually opened up the bar area to allow more people to be seated faster.

The conceierge also deserves a special mention. We did have a few stores/museums/places that we wanted to get to, and each time exact directions were given to us, with the train/subway access as well as the local map of the place, if it was not in a large building. Given the lack of street names in Tokyo, this was essential otherwise we would be spending time walking up and down looking for places.

Overall, the hotel itself was a great experience and delivered all that we had hoped for, although at a price.",5,2009/01/23
1,REDACTED,en,3153,"I am a Hilton Diamond VIP and travel extensively for business and leisure. Stayed here 6 nights with family between Xmas and New Years. This was my third stay at this hotel in the past 20 months. Good property, although I agree with reviewer SingaporeGuy10 on his assessment about overcrowding of exec lounge on 37th floor. We ended up getting a spot everyday for both breakfast and evening cocktails but it certainly packed to the limits. The staff at the exec lounge tried their best but sometimes found it hard to cope - this is a problem at many Hilton properties, in my opinion. I found the overcrowding problem actually worse at the Conrad in HKG. The food in the Tokyo Hilton's lounge is OK, but not as good as other properties - the best I can recall was Hitlon Bangkok and Conrad Singapore. 

Service at Tokyo Hilton was good, especially concierge and housekeeping. However, we found the food & bev. prices at their restaurants to be not only very high but TERRIBLE value for money. At their Teppan Grill, for new year's eve, we were charged $1250 for 3 people. We knew this going in but expected a gourmet experience (supposedly a Japanese 5-course dinner). What came out was VERY average food. It's very disappointing and does not serve Hilton well. On another occasion, at their atrium cafe, we were charge the equivalent of US$11 per cup of coffee - Yes, US$11. And no refills. 2 cups of coffee and one slice of dessert ~ US$45.",3,2009/01/07
1,REDACTED,en,3154,"After nine nights at the Hilton Tokyo this past September, I can say this: It's got the best service I've ever had a Hilton.

The hotel is about two to three hours from Narita Airport by bus, depending on traffic, which is the easiest and cheapest way to get there. Once you get there, the entire city of Tokyo is easily accessible to you. It's less than 15 minutes to walk to Shinjuku station where you can pick up the JR or take the subway to any of the wonders Tokyo has to offer. 

The hotel had a lot to offer for a ""city"" hotel. Rooms were good sized, which was nice to see after hearing horror stories about Tokyo hotels. The gym was large and clean and the staff was always ready with complimentary bottled water or towels. There were tennis courts, but they were fully booked during my stay. Umbrellas were available to guests, free of charge and taxis were plentiful. One of the nice things about the area the hotel is in, is that there is little street traffic. It's a very easy five minute walk to several 7-11 type stores (and two McDonalds if you just couldn't make it another day without a big mac). Insider tip: you can walk almost the entire distance between the Shinjuku station and the hotel underground by follwing the signs to the Tokyo government building, which was great for chilly days.

The breakfast buffet, though expensive, was a good way to start the day. It had something for everyone from American standards like pancakes, to crepes, to simple Japanese dishes. On a less enthusiastic note, the hotel bar was deserted and too pricey for what it offered. There was a Belgian place called Frigo a few blocks south west that got most of our business.

I'll close with an example of how good the service was. During my stay, I experienced a small earthquake one morning in my room. The hotel front desk actually apologized for the earthquake when I inquired about it later that day. You don't get that kind customer service at Hiltons in New York or London!",4,2009/01/06
1,REDACTED,en,3155,"I stayed at the Hilton Tokyo over the Christmas period for 5 days - mainly for business but because Tokyo is such a dynamic city, I decided to extend for a few days to catch up with the vibrancy of the city. Unfortunately, my experience with the Hilton Tokyo in Shunjuku was not as positive. 

The hotel website proclaims quite proudly that it now has newly renovated rooms and an executive floor. Well, thats as far as it goes really. 

While the rooms look nice and new (for now), the housekeeping is somewhat not what you would expect of a top notch Hilton property and certainly I have seen much better standards at the Grand Hyatt (though its more expensive) and the Conrad Tokyo (excellent, simply excellent). 

However, the WORST aspect is really the Executive Lounge, which is way way too small to cater to some 7 whole floors of executive rooms! Poor planning must have been the root cause of this anomaly. I am sure there must be some tried and tested formula for how large the executive lounge should be per 10 rooms and so on, but clearly, this was NOT the case here. The lounge was so congested and crowded and stuffy during the peak periods (breakfast and evening cocktails), it was quite a sad sight. The staff at the executive lounge kept struggling with the demands of the guests, and the food etc was slow to be replenished. 

I saw hotel guests being turned away during breakfast and evening cocktails! I was quietly observing the mayhem (the concierge staff tried to be as polite as they could but really, the situation is unforgivable) including one American gentleman saying loudly that he has stayed in many Hiltons in his lifetime and he found this to be a disgrace to the name of the hotel chain. 

My verdict is: DO NOT pay the extra and stay at the executive floors unless you do not really intend to use the lounge. However, with the money you will pay, I think it far more value-add and sensible to stay at some of the other better 4 to 5 star hotels in Tokyo (of which there are many).",1,2008/12/27

The room had a large desk, a comfortable reading chair, and plenty of room for unpacking. The views of Tokyo from the upper floors were interesting for this first-time visitor. The concierge was helpful with explaining travel options getting around the city.

The restaurant off of the lobby serves a western-style buffet breakfast, which also includes Japanese breakfast foods for the adventurous. I stuck with the American breakfast, and since I was a bit concerned about the food I'd get the rest of the day, I definitely ate a lot there and had as much coffee as I could stand.

The prices can tend to be high, but it was a great place to stay... close enough (but not too close) to Metro stations and to Shinjuku Station. I'd happily stay there on any business trip.",5,2008/12/26
1,REDACTED,en,3157,"We stayed here for one night only, on our way from London to Kyoto.
Chose the hotel for the convenient location near to Shinjuku station.
There is a complimentary shuttle bus from Shinjuku station to the hotel - it took us a while to find the bus stop (no. 21) though !

We checked in early, which was not a problem. As my wife was a gold card member, we expected to be given lounge access or a room upgrade, which is normally the case in with Hilton, however this time we were not offered either.

The room was OK, quite bland, very clean but the bathroom was rather old looking. Size was average for Hilton, but I guess not bad for Tokyo. It was a 10 minute walk to the madness of Shinjuku itself (Kabukicho area is great fun if you don't mind crowds and noise !).

We found an interesting buffet restaurant on the 8F of Lumine Est building, called 'Bitter Sweets Buffet'. All you can eat from a wide range of pasta, pizza, salads, cakes and sushi, for about 2500 yen each. There was a 2 hour time limit, amazingly some people were pushing that limit !!!

The hotel was quite boring - we did not really stay long enough to use all the facilities. No complaints, however next time I would return to the Hyatt Regency almost next door - I have stayed there before and it was nicer than the Hilton.",4,2008/12/15
1,REDACTED,en,3158,"I stayed here during my trip to Tokyo and it was great. We had arrived rather early and there wasnt any room available as yet. As we had been travelling the night before with a baby, we needed to change him and freshen ourselves up before we went out. The service staff were very nice to arrange for us to use the gym facilities and freshen up while they tried to get a room available. 

The hotel is very centrally located. Other than the free bus service to Shinjuku station, there are 2 other stations within 3-5mins walking distance. It was simply fabulous especially when you don't wish to wait for the bus.

Also, there is a 24hours Dennys across the road which is good when you have hunger pangs in the middle of the night.",4,2008/10/27
1,REDACTED,en,3159,"This is the best Hilton I have ever stayed in my whole life. I have stayed in Hilton hotels around the world including at Toronto, Miami, Chicago, Sao Paulo, Paris, Frankfurt and I have found it top amongst others in terms of room quality, size, amenities and restaurants.

I stayed in executive junior suite and the accommodation in absolutely fantastic with plush bedding, oversized windows, work-desk, good shower and above all morning breakfast and evening cocktails at executive lounge. The quality and variety of the food is first class and best in service. Staff is polite and humble and takes care of all your needs immediately. Its proximity to train stations is a plus. I only tried couple of restaurants in the hotel and found them decently priced comparing with same in other nearby hotels. Shinju-ku is a nice area to stay for westerners and I would highly recommend that Hilton should be a top choice for your next stay at Tokyo.",5,2008/10/18
1,REDACTED,en,3160,"I stayed 8 nights in this very big hotel, conveniently located near shinjuku jr station (the busiest station all over the world).
Staff is extremely friendly and helpful, rooms are large, clean and quiet.

1,REDACTED,en,3161,"Stayed here for 5 nights in a 36th floor executive king suite. Very central location close to Shinjuku station (7 minute walk or 3 minute free shuttle bus) Room was immaculately clean (daily cleaning incuding 'fold-down' doona service!), bed very comfortable, flat-screen tv, and excellent water pressure in shower. Also had wide window with shoji screens and great views (overlooked north west aspect of city and nearby park, not central city - but still amazing especially at night). 3 day free wireless internet access in room. As I was on executive floor I had complimentray breakfast in 37th floor executive lounge, access to free wireless internet in the lounge at any time of day, complimentary drinks during cocktail hour(!), and complimentary use of all sporting facilities incl pool. Only negative was that some noise from the other floors tended to be carried through the air-con vents. But overall very comfortable and refreshing stay if you're willing to pay (just under $400AUD/night)",4,2008/09/16
1,REDACTED,en,3162,"Room: We’ve booked an Executive Junior Suite, trapezoid shaped and located in 36th floor with terrific view through two deep drawn windows – west side rooms in the left wing of the building have mount Fuji-view, east side you’ll see Shinjuku’s high-rise buildings. Room itself offers stylish lounge sofa, little desk, large king bed with a wonderful mattress, absolutely clean, quiet and of course well equipped with goodies like wireless internet, huge flat screen, bathrobes, pajamas... Incomprehensible in this great and spacious room with 44 square meters there was only a very small bathroom, however fitted with a little window to the room and equipped with all needs, too. House keeping including additional night service was just perfect. 

Hotel: Of course the most unimportant feature of hotels, the exterior view is uncomely compared with other Shinjuku buildings. Inside there is a small lobby-area with only a very few chairs. Same problem in the Executive Lounge: Both facilities are clearly to small dimensioned for this huge hotel. Nevertheless the Lounge offers great drinks at the evening, but a really poor breakfast for Executive Level in a five Star rated Hotel. Also not convincing was the pool with its ambiance from the eighties. Don’t misunderstand me: Except for pool and Executive-breakfast the Tokyo Hilton with its always very friendly and obliging staff was one of the best hotels I’ve visited so far. 

Location: in walking distance to Shinjuku station (west side), the Hilton is located in one of Tokyo’s most busiest areas. They offer a free shuttle to the station, but you’ll walk easily there in the same time. From Shinjuku station you can take direct trains to Narita-Airport (Narita-Express), the cheaper Airport-limousine-bus for 3000 Yen stops in front of the hotel. Subway-access is perfect: Nishi-shinjuku station (M 07) has direct access to the hotel, this line (‘red’ Marunouchi-line) goes directly and fast to Ginza and Tokyo main station. Much more efficient than hotel-shuttle and transfer in the huge Shinjuku main station. Direct neighborhood of the hotel offers some shops and restaurants, so in the I-Land tower. Next supermarket is located in the basement of the Hyatt regency vis-à-vis the Hilton. However, real life starts on east side behind Shinjuku station first.",5,2008/09/04
1,REDACTED,en,3163,"Stayed in the Tokyo Hilton Shinjuku recently. The staff were great, Very friendly and helpful, most staff spoke English well which was handy for me as I speak almost no Japanese. It's in a great location with a free bus to Shinjuku Station 3 times a hour there and back, although it's only a short walk anyway, handy if you have bags or lots of shopping, as I did! Highly recommend this hotle.",5,2008/08/29
1,REDACTED,en,3164,"The Hilton Tokyo was pretty much all we could have wished for in a hotel in a foreign country. The service was top-notch, everyone was incredibly helpful. The rooms, although not terribly large, were a lot bigger than I expected, and the location was pretty good, though not exactly in the most active part of town. I have no complaints about this place and would gladly stay there if I ever came back to Tokyo.",4,2008/08/26
1,REDACTED,en,3165,"We stayed just one night at the Hilton Shinjuku on our way to Micronesia.
The hotel has a great location - just 5 min walk from Shinjuku main streets with shops and restaurants - and is very easy to reach it from Narita with the Limousine Bus Service which stops right at the hotel front door.

Our twin room was spacious, quite, clean and comfortable. Bathroom was a little bit small but above Japanese standards and furnished with everything you may need. 
Beds were large and comfortable.

Service is very efficient: our luggage got lost and the front desk managed the communications with the airport efficiently and they recorded messages for us while we were out for dinner.

I would certainly reccomend this hotel!",3,2008/08/20
1,REDACTED,en,3166,"I stayed for a business trip in Tokyo at the Hilton from 6 - 25 July. Booked an Executive Deluxe Room.

Arrived early in the morning, after an overnight flight, at around 10h30, check in the Executive Lounge, offered immediately early check-in, just had to wait for about 30 minutes for my room since it still had to be cleaned, but was at 11ham in my room. Very good to start, since I am HHonors Gold member they offered me additional amenities. So far so good.

The rooms are on the smallish side since the hotel has been build in the eighties and at that time rooms were rather build on the small side. In particular the closet space is limited, in particular if you are there for a longer stay. Combine this that my wife joined me for about a week, our closet space then was really limited. Bathroom is also very small, but adequate with a shower which had a very good pressure. Oh if you member of HHonors and if you book a single room, they let a second person stay for free in your room.

Housekeeping service always was prompt and good. 

The Executive Lounge is ok, the food offering was adequate and the drinks during the cocktail hours plenty, but they offer the whole day free soft drinks, coffee etc. One of the big pluses of the Executive room is that they also offer free wireless internet in your room and not only the executive lounge - extremely convenient.

Nevertheless one negative of the lounge is, that since the Hilton has 6 Executive Floors, the lounge in particular for the cocktail hour is not only too full, but plainly overcrowded sometimes.

Restaurants at the hotel are of good quality, but pricey. Their teppanayaki restaurant (Teppan Grill) is highly recommended, the food and service is wonderful - but you will pay a lot. Lets say a good dinner (teppanayki menu + wine) will run 500 USD for two persons.

The hotel also offers a free shuttle to Shinjuku Station every 20 minutes from 7am - 10 PM, which is extremely convenient.

Overall a very good business hotel with some minor weaknesses, would not hesitate to stay again there.",4,2008/07/29

The staff is helpful, friendly and courteous.
The rooms are beautifully appointed with amazing views.
The location is terrific - near 2 different metro stops - Tochomae and Shinjuku, with a free shuttle to the Shinjuku station. Also, Shinjuku is such a fantastic night spot, that it's great that the hotel is within walking distance.
We had breakfast included with our room (Hilton Honors program) and the food is wonderful. Huge buffet with tons of Japanese and Western choices. About 8 different types of juice alone!",5,2008/07/23

Will definitely stay there again.",5,2008/07/12
1,REDACTED,en,3170,"I switched to stay at the Hilton in Tokyo due to I stay more in Hilton family more in the U.S. Given most of the rooms in Tokyo Hilton are renovated (except rooms on the standard Hilton Floor) so I decided to give it a try.

Some earlier reviews are correct, the elevators are still v. dated. I didn't remember how the old lobby floor look, even now, it doesn't look glamourous and great. . The lift foyer and the corridor of my floor smell like a farm, i reported the next day, but the ordor was still there until I checked out. However, the ordor didn't seep into the room.
Location ~ The hotel is in the heart of office buidings, there is a free hotel shuttle running every 20mins to the Shinjuku station right in front of Keio Dept store Bus stop no. 21where the shoppings and restaurants are. 

The Room - The simplistic reburbishment made the rooms brighter and a modern look. But definitely not luxurious. The bathroom is v. simple, only the wall around the tub replaced by some plastic wall, no tiles. There was no bathrobe in the room, you have to ask for it. I was also told they actually only offer in suites ~~ the bathrobe in fact are not quality at all, they are rough after years of combating with the washing machine.

The arrival ~ bell staff was short. The bell staff dropped my bags in the check in area unattended then left. The reception check in staff was cold though polite. I asked if there s a possiblity of an upgrade for HiltonHonor VIP. I was told they only upgrade regular customers ~~ my understanding was regulars apply only to Tokyo Hilton, Hilton Honor members are not regular ) 

Restaurant ~ I visted their 2star Michelin French restaurant ~Twenty One. It was rather disappointed. The service definitely is under par comparing to other one-star Michelin. Many non-Michelin restaurants can produce same quality of dishes.

I was rather disapointed on my first return to the Hilton after a 8-year lapse. A concierge staff changed my impression. I realized i was over-charged by a restaurant in Shinjuku on my last night. Hilton helped me to reserve the table. I didnt' realize it until the next day wondering why the dinner bill was so pricey. I asked for translation of the bill, Ms. Morita, a polite concierge staff speaks perfect English, explained to me the bill was for a table of 9 guests, while she knew I only booked a table for 4. She took down all the dishes I had order. After my meeting, she sorted everything out for me, the restaurant even sent back the new receipt and the over-charged amount. It's Ms. Morita went that extra mile for the houseguests that win my heart again.",2,2008/07/06

Our daughter got to play tennis (private lessons) on their roof top tennis courts every day. 
The hotel is conveniently located very near the subway station but the hotel even has a shuttle bus from and to the hotel from the subway station. The walking distante is otherwise less than 10 minutes. Lots of shops are to be found near the hotel.

Hotel located in a great location as well. All round a 5 star experience.",5,2008/06/05
1,REDACTED,en,3175,"I'm a Hilton man and this one in Shinjuku hits the right notes. Really, the location is the only slight negative and that isn't so bad. (It's in west Shinjuku, while the real action in Shinjuku is over on the eastside about 15 minutes away by foot and even less by subway.) I stayed on the executive floor where the room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was adequately large enough, though some more space would have been nice. The executive lounge was as great as they always are (well, the food & drinks are free, so why complain). The workout gym was on the small size but it had enough equipment to keep me happy.",4,2008/05/29
1,REDACTED,en,3176,"We stayed at the Hilton twice in May, once in a regular room, the second time on an executive floor. ( We are gold members) We were given gratis breakfast during the first stay, which was very good, a lobby restaurant buffet on the Childrens Day holiday weekend, when there were many Japanese families staying. We had the Executive lounge breakfast during the second stay and that was delicious, as was the cocktail buffet there in the evening. The rooms in which we stayed were not that much different, though I recall the Exec room had a fancy shower head and terry robes along with the traditional yukata cotton robes. The staff could not have been nicer during both stays. The Shinjuko station area has everything one could want in shopping and restaurants and it is easy to walk there, once given directions. ( the hotel has an excellent map of the area) The huge Shinjuko Garden/Park is gorgeous - and a short walk beyond the station. Having said that, the Shinjuko Station is pretty confusing - so though we took the Narita Express back to the airport on leaving, we took the ""Friendly""limo bus directly from Narita to the hotel on arrival .",5,2008/05/24

So if you are out for a late night, you dont even have to call a cab to take you back. 
Service at the hotel is amazing. The staff are really polite and helpful and they will really go out of their way to explain something to you as well. A major bonus is the room service menu... amazing food.

1,REDACTED,en,3179,"my wife and I were on a 5 day stop over from London to NZ where we were staying at the Hilton Tokyo, within a day of arriving my wife was rushed to hospital (suprisingly right accross the road and she could see the room from her hospital bed) where she was for 2 weeks, during this time the Hilton staff were incredible, not only did they take my wife to hospital at 2am in the morning and translate her burst appendix symptoms to the Japanese doctor, but every morning for two weeks, a Hilton staff member who could speak English came to visit my wife's hospital bed, so we could communicate with the doctors and they would translate. Every morning they packed my wife a Hilton Continental Breakfast so she didn't have to endure Japanese hospital food (of course when she could finally eat). They upgraded me to the executive room for these two weeks, with no change in my (advance purchase double room) rate. This rates as the best accomodation ever... whether this was the Hilton, the nature of the Japanese or the fact that my wife is a Gold Member, we can't confirm, but don't believe that the rooms are tired, they're clean, minimal and very Japanese in style. And the view of the start of the Tokyo marathon from the rooms is fantastic. An amazing stay, even though the wife's trip was a nightmare, the Hilton made it so much easier for us both. We can't wait to see the staff again, We feel like this is a second home... and the view of Mt Fuji from the exec room on a clear day is magical",5,2008/05/02

1,REDACTED,en,3181,"I've stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in April 2008. Hotel is very old (although lobby seems to be refreshed quite recently), rooms are very simply decorated with outdated furniture, bathroom appliances are also coming from the 70s. As a frequent business traveller, I have stayed in a number of international chain hotels throughout the Asia (Thailand, China, Hong Kong, and Singapore)- I would say that this hotel is about the same level as a moderate, rather old, 3-4* hotel (like Holiday Inn or Ramada) in Shanghai or Beijing, for a price of Ritz Carlton in Shanghai. Bed is not as comfortable as one would expect from a 5 star property, towels are very thin, shower was weak in my room and very simple slippers are ok for a petite lady's feet (my shoe size is an american 6 and slippers were ok for me).",2,2008/04/23
1,REDACTED,en,3182,"We booked our trip to Japan through a Japanese travel agency and this hotel was part of the package deal. It is a good location in that it is near the Shinjuku station, which is one of the major subway and JR line stops. There is also a free shuttle to and from the station, which helped (though the walk isn't bad).

The hotel seems a litle nicer than your standard Hilton hotels in the US. We stayed here twice - a few days when we arrived and then a few days before we headed home. Service was great and we used the concierge service numerous times to find good restaurants around the area. It's a hit and miss with staff speaking English, although for the most part they understood us.

We only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was a Japanese and Western style buffet that was excellent. However, we skipped eating restaurants on the second floor as they were a bit pricey.

If Tokyo is the only city you're visiting I'd probably recommend a different hotel as Shinjuku is a business district and pretty quiet at night unless you hang out at the station (the shuttle service ends around 9:30PM). If Tokyo is one of many cities on your agenda, I thought this was a great choice. Only downside is the JR to Kyoto/Osaka leaves from Tokyo station, so you have to change stations if you venture west. I strongly recomend getting the JR pass if you do so.",5,2008/04/17
1,REDACTED,en,3183,"According to my passport, I have stayed in this hotel 23 times in the past eight years. I have been coming to Tokyo regularly on business during this time and I thought it might be useful to write a review based aimed at this type of traveller rather than a tourist.
I have always stayed on an executive floor and made use of the lounge facilities. As a diamond member of the Hilton Honors program, I was surprised at first to find that room upgrades do not tend to feature in the Hilton asian region. However, the room gifts are very generous and you can expect to find a bottle of wine (very expensive here), some chocolates and fresh fruit upon arrival.
The service is, of course, excellent. It starts as you arrive at the main doors where the Doorman (or more likely woman) greets you. If you are staying on the executive floor, you are taken straight to the dedicated check-in on 34. The staff there have remained constant over the past eight years and are excellent at their jobs. A swift check-in will take you to your room. The doubles are small by western standards and if you can afford it, a junior executive suite does give more reasonable space, especially if you are going to be resident for a few days.
Following a major upgrade last year, the rooms are very well decorated in a ""fusion"" style with both good work and relaxation areas as well as the comfortable bed. All executive rooms have flatscreen tv's and DVD players.
The views from this level are magnificent and if you are at the ""back"" of the hotel you can often see Fuji in the distance - but look early in the morning because the mountain tends to cloud up later in the day.
Wireless broadband is available at no cost if you are a diamond member and there is a business centre on the lobby floor just past the Abiste concession.
Room service is comprehensive and served perfectly but be prepared to pay very high prices. A three course set meal with a glass of wine will cost about £80 and most westerners will still be hungry and possibly thirsty afterwards.
There are eight restaurants in the hotel ranging from classical Japanese and Chinese through to Michelin French and a brazzerie.
A note for first time Brits...the Chinese food is nothing like our Chinese food so be prepared to be adventurous!
Apart from the Brazzerie, Chequers, the cost is in line with Tokyo restaurants. If you are entertaining, be prepared for £100 to £130 per head.
For relaxing in the evening, executive floor members have access to the lounge where drinks are served free.from about 6pm for an hour. Given the incredibly high price of wine, this is a very good perk although you have already paid for it in your higher room tarrif. 
St Georges bar in the lobby has free access for executive club members and normally has some form of entertainment from either Austrailian or British groups. Those of you who have seen Lost in Translation with Scarlett Johannsen and Bill Murray will know the type. 
Breakfast is served in the executive lounge and is again very good.
As an executive floor member, one also has free access to the health club and swimming pool. A couple of cultural tips here...in the pool it is normal to wear a (supplied) cap. If you decide to take a bath, then read up on the procedure first. Google ""Japanese Bath Procedeure"" for some examples.
ln the basement, one can find a newsagent selling western books and little knick-knack souvenirs. Also a few restaraunts cheaper than the main hotel including a very good Indian. There is a womens hairstylist and an excellent Gentlemen's barber in the finest tradition with many other services such as back massage, wet shave and manicure. After a twelve hour flight from the UK and the journey from Narita, this is always my first port of call to start getting over the inevitable west/east jet lag. If gently prompted, the proprietor will happily show you photos of him and the current and former Prime Ministers of Japan, both of whom are customers.
Overall, The Hilton Shinjuki is expensive but gives value for money. The service is always warmly given and any attempt at tipping is gently refused.
It is a perfect place to stay if in Tokyo for business.",5,2008/04/17
1,REDACTED,en,3184,"Stayed at the deluxe room on the 15th floor, for a night on Mar 27 2008

Location: 
• 10 mins walk to Shinjuku Station or take the Hilton Shuttle Bus at Bus Bay 20, outside Keio Department Store
• Located next to Hyatt, and Hyatt is located next to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building 

Lobby/Front Desk/Concierge
• Modern, Updated & Efficient, with the Marble Lounge well-sighted on the right.
• Front Desk is business-like & efficient
• The concierge desk is perpetually busy but extremely efficient. I needed a hair-cut badly and the concierge recommended me Courreges Beaute Salon and helped me with the reservations. I loved the cut!

Room
• Plush & comfortable beds
• Décor is modern Japanese but somewhat dated feel.
• Broadband Access
• Huge LCD TV
• Evelyn & Crabtree toiletries

For a Hilton, I had higher expectations. The hotel is clearly dated, with the lobby renovated from a modern new look (but can spot the tell-tale signs of an old hotel). Rooms, at least for the deluxe, needs upgrading.",4,2008/04/03
1,REDACTED,en,3185,"This is our third stay at this hotel. It's clean, it's safe, it's convenient. There's a free shuttle bus that runs to the train station in Shinjuku and it's located close to the subway station (Marunoichi Line). The friendly staff is courteous and the facility inside the hotel is great. There's a pool, tennis court, workout room, shops and restaurant on the lower floors of the hotel and on the second floor, and a business room with internet access. The only other places in Shinjuku I would consider other than this hotel is the Keio Plaza Hotel and the Hyatt, which I have stayed in and both are excellent hotels. However, I suppose I'm nitpicking but there are a couple things I do not like about this hotel:

1. The beds were uncomfortable for my liking. It's quite stiff and small. 

2. We had the standard room. My wife and I stayed in the room with our son and after they added the extra bed in our room, it was quite cramped in our room.

3. The television in our room had approximately 15 channels of which most were in Japanese. The only English channels were CNN, BBC, Discovery Channel and Cartoon Network. The Pay Per View Channels were playing really old movies and expensive. I would have preffered having at least one business channel like Fox Business News or CNBC and Fox News over CNN or BBC.

4. Every service imaginable cost money at this hotel. Internet access in the business room was $4 per 15 minutes. Gym, pool, and tennis court all were expensive. Be prepared to be nickel and dimed to death.

5. They gave us a discount for breakfast. The standard price was 3500 yen per person but it's 3100 yen with the discount. In my previous stay at this hotel, I've had this breakfast and it was marginal. This price is outrageous considering that you can have a full blown breakfast next door at the Royal Host restaurant for about 1000 yen with a stack of pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage, and coffee. Everything in the hotel is outrageously expensive. During our 5 day stay there, we never ate or used any of their facilities because their charges were outrageous..

6. Since this is our 3rd stay at this hotel, we noticed that the interior of the hotel is starting to look dated. I remember when I first stayed at this hotel, it was alot nicer. Since we hardly stayed in the hotel during the day, it didn't really matter much but I'm starting to notice the difference between this hotel and the Hyatt Shinjuku more and more.

All my criticisms are minor so overall, I recommend this hotel. In addition for all travelors staying at this hotel, I recommend the following:

1. There's a 7-11 near the hotel so buy your munchies there since they have a great selection.
2. There's tons of great restaurant around the hotel so eat out. If you miss McDonalds, it's a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Most of the restaurants around the hotel is open until about 10PM. McDonald is open 24/7.
3. Take the subway if you can't read Japanese since most of station names are written in English and it's much faster and cheaper than taxi. I recommend you download the subway map from http://www.tokyometro.jp/global/en/index.html.
4. If you need internet access, go to the internet cafes in Shinjuku since it's alot cheaper and the coffee and food there are awesome.
5. Tipping is not required if you eat at restaurant around the hotel so you save 15% on all foods if you eat outside the hotel. Also, if you do eat at the restaurant in the hotel, they'll usually add the tip to your bill automatically so read your bill carefully.

We picked this hotel because we had a great deal thru our travel agency which included 5 days stay at the Hilton Shinjuku, roundtrip limousine bus service from Narita airport to the hotel, and a round trip ticket on Singapore Airlines from LA to Tokyo for approximately $1300US per person. In my opinion, I don't think there'a a better deal out there. We totally enjoyed our trip to Tokyo and it was worth every penny!.",4,2008/03/28
1,REDACTED,en,3186,We have been travelling around Japan for roughly a month and Hilton Tokyo was the first hotel we stayed in. We spent 9 nights at the hotel and its probably one of the best hotels we have stayed in so far. The service was excellent and the staff were very helpful. The rooms were also spotless everyday we were there. The hotel also had a shuttle both from the hotel to the Shinjuku JR station. The area was also very easy to get around with food outlets everywhere. Do check out the Government Building viewing platform at night. Its beautiful and its opened till around 2300.,5,2008/03/19
1,REDACTED,en,3187,"Highly recommend, shared a twin standard room. Very roomy, well appointed, good value. Right on top of a subway station also so easy to get around.",5,2008/02/28
1,REDACTED,en,3188,This hotel is an upscale Hilton in a good central location. I got a renovated room on high floor with a view of Mt Fuji. The room was nice size for Tokyo and was very clean/modern. The bathroom was clean but it did not seem to be renovated in a while. The service was good but I would not stay here again as I found it more oriented towards the business traveler. It is a good hotel if you want to stay in Shinjuku but away from the crazy crowds. You can easily walk to Shinjuku station from this hotel. The hotel is very close to Nishi-Shinjuku station and you can easliy walk from there in less then 5 mins.,4,2008/02/24
1,REDACTED,en,3189,"A home away from home. I spent two weeks here whilst on business and stayed on the newly renovated executive floors.

Marvellous. From the breakfast in the morning to the exec club lounge in the evening - a beautiful way to end a hard day. 

Staff remember your name - not just the Exec staff but also the doormen and concierge. It's nice to come out of a taxi to hear :""did you have a good day in the office?"". First time I wondered whether they were addressing me.

So I've waxed lyrical about the exec floor and the comforts an aged businessman appreciates. Anything else?

Positives - the brilliant Japanese bath house down by the gym; the nothing is too much attitude from the staff (even looking after a valuable painting for me when I was called off to Singapore); the quality of the dining and the service.

Negatives - if you are in an older room it can be a bit seventies; Shinjuku is an ok location but nothing great (business on one side where the hotel is; sordid on the other) - but for the real Tokyo try the Grand Hyatt in Roppongi Hills; or the Cerrullean Towers in Shibuya. 

And as much as I like the Hilton, if you want to stay in Shinjuku, just check that the Park Hyatt isn't available first - it, and it's New York Bar and Grill are truely stunning.

Don't get me wrong though - it's a great place to stay",5,2008/02/15
1,REDACTED,en,3190,"My wife and I stayed at the Tokyo Hilton in Shinjuku for 7 nights. The hotel was very central with a little known entrance to the subway in the basement floor via an underground tunnel...great for when it is wet outside. The staff were polite and very helpful. Our room was also quite large even by western standards. The standards of the accomodations were very high, comfy soft beds, robes, flat panel TV, etc. The veiws were also quite spectacular, especially if you had a higher floor. Overall, a great stay at near luxury hotel.",5,2008/02/02
1,REDACTED,en,3191,"Stayed a week at Hilton Tokyo located in west Shinjuku, Dec 18-26. Rate was decent for a Hilton and used Tripadvisor to advise me when a cheaper rate showed up so that I could rebook the stay.

Typical Hilton; everything as expected. Extremely polite service (to be expected), very clean hotel; excellent beds and pillows which is typical of most Hiltons I have stayed in. Probably could use some updating since the hotel, in some parts, looked tired. The price included the buffet breakfast which is excellent - a variety of hot and cold/continental foods, Japanese breakfast items, fresh fruits, espresso bar, juices, etc. Truly a delight.

The hotel was about a 10 minute walk to the Shinjuku subway station (busiest in Tokyo) or one could take a Hilton shuttle bus to the station (free) - trips are very very frequent so you never have to wait long and run till about 10pm every day. The hotel also has direct access to the Toei line which we used to get to Tsukiji Market at 5am. Do not miss the market visit. If you like sushi/sashimi, then you now will love it. Overall then, the location was good; outside of the hustle and bustle of Shinjuku station and amongst office towers, yet close enough to walk to the main station. Also linked via underground route which can get confusing. Pretty much all the shopping you need to do is around the Shinjuku station although easy enough to take a subway ride to Ginza, Akihabara, Harajuku, Roppongi, etc to see the local sights. Just don't get on the subway at rush hour - they are packed.

Did not use the facilities (gym etc). In-room internet is extra but the free internet service was adequate. Concierge was very helpful in locating shops, restaurants and printing maps for you from the local Yahoo/Google sites. Busy hotel and popular with families.

Would stay again.",4,2008/02/01
1,REDACTED,en,3192,"This was my first trip to Tokyo and I stayed at the hilton for 7 nights. The service provided by the Hilton staff was absolutely first class as they spoke fluent english and were extremely knowledgable on events, attractions and also transportation.

I was upgraded to a King Executive suite which was big even by western standards and very comfortable inluding a sofa, comfy chair and work desk. It was a pleasure to come back to the Hilton at the end of each day and the room was always spotless, house cleaning even arranged my toiletries neatly around the basin.

The location is a 10 minute walk from Shinjuku station or you can take the free shuttle bus which runs every 10-20 minutes depending on the time of day. The location is in a quiet part of Shinjuku and has parklands close by which can provide a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo.

I would recommend this hotel to everyone and would definately stay there again. The price is very reasonable for the room and level of service provided.",5,2008/01/08
1,REDACTED,en,3193,"We stayed in this busy Shinjuku Hilton with our two school age children. It was fantastic. We were lucky enough to stay on the Executive floor which meant that there was some sort of food available from 6am-6pm which really helps with jet lagged families. We also had a private English speaking concierge who could help with all tourist and travel needs. We all loved the English/Japanese breakfast buffet that was included with a room on these floors.
Our room was spacious by Japanese standards. We were upgraded to a suite which was incredible. Both were up to date and very clean. The beds were comfortable. The hotel brought us a requested humidifier immediately. The service is gracious and helpful. The spectacular views are unfortunately obstructed by other modern buildings. 
Unfortunately the pool was being renovated while we were there so I have nothing to report. The room service was adequate but INCREDIBLY expensive.
The hotel runs a bus every fifteen minutes to Shinjuku station which is helpful. You can also walk through an underground pass from the hotel to the Shinjuku East station.",5,2008/01/04
1,REDACTED,en,3194,"This is a GREAT hotel. The customer service was fantastic and the location was so convenient. The subway is at your doorstep and the area is very clean. The room was spotless! The beds were kind of hard, but that was the ONLY complaint, if any, we had. The staff speaks english and were extremely helpful with everything from renting a cell phone to getting around the subway/trains. There is a convenient pharmacy/store in the hotel with all of the toiletries you could ever need plus some. And the business center was easy to access. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. But beware, the breakfast buffet is REALLY expensive at the hotel ($70 for 2). Better to eat at Denny's ($20 for 2) or Starbucks across the street. p.s. Good luck at Shinjuku Train Station!!!!",5,2007/12/03
1,REDACTED,en,3195,"First of all - great location...you have the metro right downstairs. And I really liked the room - terrific view and I had braced myself for the tiny rooms I had heard about in Tokyo but I was impressed, room was a very decent size and very well appointed. It had a Japanese flair, particularly the window dressing, and was immaculate. My understanding was that the hotel was full the weekend I was there (Nov 16-18 2007) but you'd never know it...and here's where the hotel exceeded expectations - the service. During check-in there was an issue with my VIP card, which was brand new and not a big deal because the upgrade to Executive Level would have been a smoking room with two beds and I wanted a non-smoking King so I didn't care about the upgrade really. But the woman at the desk made sure everything was worked out with my card so that I could at least get coupons for a free breakfast. She actually spent time on the phone (her doing) making sure that my old Hilton member account was incorporated into the VIP to ensure that the VIP was the active account to allow me to get full benefits. And the beauty was that there were no lines behind me because they kept so much staff behind the front desk - I never saw anyone waiting during my stay. 

Concierge was superb - here again, plenty of staff behind the desk - no waits despite the hotel bustle - and they were so willing to help and very knowledgeable. The doormen and women also made you feel so welcome, very friendly. I felt at home coming back after being out all day.

The breakfast buffet had a nice variety and was pretty good (and free for me thanks to the front desk help). I ordered room service twice and found the entrees to be quite good. 

I will say that in general I think Tokyo is very welcoming, I had no rude experiences there - and the Hilton isn't cheap...but for me this hotel was worth the money - a charming (even for it's large size), reliable, well appointed hotel (the lobby Christmas tree was very well done) in a good location - very nice rooms and excellent, excellent service. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2007/11/27
1,REDACTED,en,3196,"Everything is expensive in Tokyo, but this hotel wasn't too bad, with a package that included the first night's dinner when you booked two nights, and also included a decent breakfast in the lobby restaurant. There is a shuttle to the Shinjuku train station, and the Tokyo Tower is right next door. Rooms are a bit small, but that is all too common in Japan. They are adequately furnished with a comfortable bed, an important feature when you've been flying for 20+ hours.",4,2007/11/21
1,REDACTED,en,3197,"Stayed four nights at the Hilton in Tokyo, during November 2007.
Nice hotel, however the rooms are on the small side, and the bed was only a double and very hard.(And you can't open any windows for fresh air) Bathrooms are older style, shower in the bath, and are very small. Buffet Breakfast was good. Location was a little out of the centre, but does give you a quite nights sleep.
But this is offset with a courtsey shuttle to the Shinjuku train station. The Nishi-Shinjuku station is underneth the hotel, however, it is not part of the JR rail system. So a JR pass is not any good. It will cost just under $2.00 to get to Tokyo.
Nice Italian buffet Restaurant on the 2nd floor ($50.00).
Most oustanding aspect was the quality of service.
The best I have ever experienced.
Most staff do have a good grasp for English. 
Got a very good deal with Asia Rooms, $240.00 a night for two, with breakfast.",4,2007/11/20
1,REDACTED,en,3198,"Stayed at the hilton on honors points (2 free nights) and 2 paid nights. We stayed in a double room on the 8th floor (no upgrade and the room was not renovated).

The Hilton rooms come with 2 complimentary bottles of water upon check in. Our room had a mini bar/honor bar, flat screen tv (only english channel was cnn). The bed was firm and came with 4 pillows but no sheet; only a comforter.

The hilton buffet breakfast is 3600 yen(approx $32 USD per per person and includes juices, omelet station, fresh fruit, yogurt, many pastries and croissants. It also includes more japanese food that we did not try. For the price, it was not worth it to us. 

Dennys (which is not like the Dennys in the US) is a short 2 minute walk from the hotel. They do have french toast and pancakes but don't expect a full american breakfast. 

Shinjuku station is a 10 min walk from the hotel and they do have a complimentary shuttle that runs to and from the station (when arriving at the station, exit and find the Keio Dept store. The Hilton bus will stop at bus stop 21. Email the hotel for hours of operation and pick up times.

Although we used our honors points, I would not stay here again if we were to return. I would try the Grand Hyatt in Roppongi (better location) or the Mandarin Oriental if you can afford it. Book early!

1,REDACTED,en,3199,"I stayed at the executive suite in august, with some friends. we had dinner and breakfast included. The food was excellent, just as the view from our room. There was nothing to complain about, i am definately booking Hilton again.",5,2007/10/30
1,REDACTED,en,3200,"I booked this four night stay on awards points using the AXON promo for 125,000 points (available only for Hilton AMEX card holders). Anyways, I wanted to book at the Conrad where I had a great stay on a prior trip, but they had already fulfilled their allotment for HHonors bookings. We came in by train from the airport and had trouble finding where the shuttle picked up. Luckily, we had rented a cell phone from the airport and were able to call them. It ended up being by the Keio Department store. It is confusing because it shares its bus stop with the city bus and there is only a little sign with the Hilton logo that marks it. 

Our room was not ready at 1PM (check in time is not till 3 or 4) however we were able to get some lunch across the street at Denny’s while we waited. The room was ready by 2 and I got a free upgrade to the executive floor for being a gold member. The room was very clean and fresh. The views were also good. While the room was free, the roll away for the third person cost us a whopping 7000 yen a night (approx. $65). I know this included the occupancy charge for the third person, but still. The internet was also free on the executive floors. 

The executive lounge was very nice (I would say even better than Conrad’s). It was very large and always had a full stock of soda’s water, and beer that guests could just help themselves to. The evening reception was nice and had a full comp bar and snacks. The free breakfast had both western and Japanese dishes. 

The only problem we had during our stay was that when we booked a helicopter tour at the concierge desk they gave us the instructions to tell leave one hour ahead of time to get their early (and tell then that we were leaving so they could confirm it). After the one hour mark we were only just over half way their. When we called to cancel they said it was 100% cancellation fee. This ruined the entire afternoon because this was supposed to be the highlight of our trip. To compensate the hotel ended up being able to get them to waive the cancellation fee. 

The indoor pool was a little bit of a disappointment. Considering how much they charge ($25/person/day) it was quite bleak. Being gold I got free admission. They made you wear these dumb swimming caps and the place on a whole looks dilapidated and of need of remodel. They had separate male and female saunas and baths and this of course meant it was ‘traditional Japanese’. I had to say I was a little bit hesitant at first to strip all the way down and ’take a bath’ with other people, but when I finally did it I could finally see why they do it. It is very relaxing and worth a try (at least once). 

On a side note I would highly recommend going to karaoke. Basically, you rent a small private room for a couple of hours, buy a couple of drinks, get some bar food, and you sing your heart out with your friends and family. They have just about every English song ever made and the controls for the song selection are in English too. I am no singer, but we ended doing this almost every night. It only cost like $25 for a few hours. Just ask the concierge for the details. 

All in all I would only recommend this place only if you were not able to get into Conrad (200% better). If you do stay here, secure a room on the executive floor. It’s well worth it.

1,REDACTED,en,3201,"We stayed our last night at the Hilton.

It was great to use the free shuttle from Shinjuku station (outside of Keio dept. store) and then not worry about our luggage, except to point it out to the bellman, until we checked out the next day.

From the moment you step inside, people are helping you to find the check-in line, get your luggage sent to your room, etc. Nearly everyone speaks fantastic English. 

The room is nice, the bed was decent sized and comfortable. Nice amenities in the bathroom, etc. It was a little more than $200 per night. We belong to Hilton Honors, but were not upgraded (nor did we expect to be, but one always hopes!).

The only real letdown was the breakfast. Breakfast is geared to the all you can eat buffett (Western or Japanese style). We only wanted a la carte and paid through the nose for cold toast, regular fried eggs, and blah french toast. Coffee was $9 per person, which was only more annoying given that the coffee was so awful. I think we would have done better to have simply ordered room service in our room for breakfast. There were more a la carte choices and the prices were reasonable (room service prices already include tax and tip ).

Location: It's ok. It's the ""hotel district"" of Shinjuku. Shinjuku is a large area and you're not far from alot of the nightlife and restaurants, but you definitely have to get out of the high rise hotel district first to find something more interesting. It is really close to the Tokyo Municipal Govt. Building and I recommend seeking it out for the high level views of Tokyo.

Overall, it was a nice place to stay for our last night of our trip. I'm not sure I would specifically seek out the Hilton Tokyo again, but I appreciated the level of service and convenience of staying here (took the limo bus back to Narita directly from the hotel).

This was my first visit to Tokyo and to Japan and I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the accommodation. The hotel, however, was fantastic and the service was by far the best that I had ever experienced. There was always a member of staff available to assist you with a query and I never had to wait long for anything. Everyone was extremely friendly and spoke English to a very high standard.

My room was beautiful and as it was on the 38th floor, it had fantastic views of the surrounding skyscrapers and access to the Executive Lounge.

The shuttle bus was also very good and always on time.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Tokyo!

1,REDACTED,en,3205,"We just spent 9 days staying at the Tokyo Hilton and I wouldn't hesitate in recommending it to anyone. The Japanese are an amazing people and have 'customer service' down to a fine art! Their culture is fascinating and well worth experiencing.

They are also very modest, so if you ask if they speak English they will always indicate 'a little', but most of them speak and understand more than a little :)

The room we had was a good size, the service was excellent and we are now looking into having one of those Japanese toilets installed in our own home :)

The hotel staff are excellent and nothing is too much bother. I had a problem with my foot and the hotel reception arranged an appointment for me with an orthapaedic doctor close to the hotel. They also sent a fluent English-speaking staff member along with me to translate. The doctor was very good and took his time to make sure he understood exactly what my problem was - and the result being I was able to keep walking around, and without pain - and let's face it, if you cannot walk in Tokyo you're in trouble!

Yes, the hotel restaurants are very expensive, but department stores like Keio and Odayku at Shinjuku Station have 2 floors of Japanese food available for purchase at a reasonable price (and a mind boggling variety at that). Mind you, it is worth experiencing room service at least once.

The shuttle bus between the hotel and Shinjuku Station is brilliant and made lugging all that shopping back to the hotel so much easier :) What's that?? People don't only go to Tokyo to shop??? <evil grin> Yes, I know - so many things to do and places to see - you will never manage in one trip - so pick a few good ones, and know there will always be more when you go back the next time. I haven't met anyone who didn't like Tokyo. This was our second trip and won't be the last. We will definitely be staying at the Tokyo Hilton next time.

Rooms are small (compared to other countries), but they have everything and the bed is very nice and large! And the japanese toilets are of course an experience!

The hotel is close to Shinjuku station where there is access to virtually all of Tokyo. In the morning you have to walk to station as the shuttle bus starts after 08, but is there late in the evening.

The only very minor minus was that because we did not have our laptop with us we had to use the business center at the ground floor and we had to pay extra for the half hour connection. Actually the member of staff though too that it is free but after checking he was sorry that it was not the case.
But actually what does few euros mean if you can have as nice hotel experience as in Hilton Tokyo hotel.

They were still the ""old"" Tokyo Hilton style. Everything was still in good shape and very clean so no major complaints, I just was surprised they seemed to stop 75% through the remodeling process. The room was of respectable size. The staff were quite friendly and helpful. Had a nice view of the park nearby. The location was good for my needs. The hotel is connected through an underground walk (about 5min.) to the Nishi-Shinjuku station on the Marunouchi subway line.

1,REDACTED,en,3210,"'Vacationed in Japan for 10 days with our base camp at the Tokyo Hilton and since this was our second trip in the last year so we pretty much knew what we were getting: Nice, clean business hotel conveniently located near the Shinjuku train station which serves as one of the larger metro/train hubs to the rest of Tokyo. The service (bell man, front desk, maid service) was on par with most 4 star international chains, meaning pleasent, friendly, but not over the top like a 5 star hotels. Our room was decent sized with a queen, desk, sitting chairs, LCD TV, small table and a single shower/tub combo. The rooms vary in size, depending on the price. In room internet is available, but at a charge. We didn't spend much time at the hotel or using it's ammenities as most of our day trips took us out of the area (via shinkansen/bullet train). One convenient perk is
the shuttle that runs to/from the Shinjuku station. This'll save you a 660 Yen cab fair, each way. There's also a metro stop underneath the hotel, but it's quite a walk within the tunnels before one reaches the action stop. The hotel shuttle was much more accessible.
The hotel is situated on the west side of the train station where most of the business hotels and government building are located. However, the east side of the station is an entirely different beast;
department stores, cafes, boutiques, electronic stores, little markets, 100 Yen stores, etc. DefinItely spend some time exploring the east side. With regards to another reviewer's comment on attitude
towards females: I really didn't notice any difference. However, I did notice that some of the staff was a bit friendly to the western guests (vs Asians). Another observation was that western guests tended to tip the bellman in spite of the non tipping practice in Asia. Ymmv.",4,2007/04/13
1,REDACTED,en,3211,"The Hilton is comparable to most city hotels you find in large cities, like Tokyo, New York, London, etc. The more you pay the better amenities you are going to get. So in an expensive city like Tokyo if you don’t pay a lot of money you won’t get top notch luxury most times. I think that pretty clear. 

There’s typically two ways to improve your chances of getting a better room in hotels, pay more or join loyalty programs. In my case my experience at the Hilton was pleasant. I stayed there for close to a month. I was fortunate because I could pay a reasonable price but since I am a Diamond member I was upgrades to a junior suite. So the lesson here is usually a hotel will treat you better if you are loyal otherwise pay a lot of money to gain access to the amenities. That’s just the fact of life in big cities across the world especially since now the hotel industry is booming again due to business travelers traveling more again. It’s just supply and demand, so prices are high.

The other nice things I liked about this hotel is it is centrally located and in walking distance of the Shinjuku Station. And for me this was important because that was my mode of transportation to get to work and it is the fastest way to get around because there’s a lot of traffic. There’s a good variety of restaurants to choose from but I always suggest to people to venture out into town. This is also a way to get better prices on food. The views of the city and Mt. Fuji is a plus if you are on a higher floor.

1,REDACTED,en,3212,"I have to wonder at the previous poster's negative review. I just returned from 5 nights at the Tokyo Hilton. I'm a widowed mother traveling with my 2 teenaged sons, and felt no anti-feminine discrimination whatsoever. Yes, the beds were singles, but I knew this going in and that is what is offered to both male and female travelers on the website. Smaller rooms are common in Japan. I travel internationally multiple times a year, and found the Hilton to be a wonderful hotel. Yes, it's getting older, but it's been beautifully kept up. The single beds struck me as over-sized for singles, and I found the firm mattress and soft duvet to be delightfully comfortable. In any event, the beds were quite adequate for my 5'7"" frame as well as my 6'+ son and his younger brother. The addition of a 3rd single, did take away some of the room space we would have had, but it was no problem. I loved that the windows are covered with shoji screens instead of curtains. It gave the room a lovely, Japanese feel. The bathroom is not overly large, but is well-appointed and quite adequate. (The high-tech toilet-bidet, so popular in Japan, adds an amusing bit of cultural diversity, too. :)) Toothbrushes and other amenities are replaced each day. Two types of green tea, instead of coffee, and a water boiler are provided in the room. Robes and slippers were provided as well. Our hotel room was almost eerily quiet. I almost wished the whisper-fan would make more white noise! We were in a regular, non-executive, room on the 12th floor. I did think the charge for pool and gym was ridiculously high, but room service, to my surprise, was cheaper than in most US hotels. A la carte muffins were under $5 for an assortment of 3; waffles, french toast or pancakes a la carte were under $7. All prices already included service and tax--unheard of in the US! There's no tipping in Japan, so the price quoted was the price paid at checkout. (The exchange rate was around 117 yen to the dollar when we were there, 3/18-24/2007.) Also, an in-room massage was available (to women only, if I understood the card correctly) for about $50; quite a deal. Service was speedy and friendly. A requested adapter and transformer showed up immediately. When we had trouble with our television, two persons arrived within minutes to set it right. The front desk offered quick translation and travel advice with a smile. The hotel is in an ideal location for travel with subway stops on two lines within a block, and an easy walk to huge Shinjuku station, if you want to skip the one-stop ride. There is a free hotel shuttle as well, but we used the subway as it was so easy and convenient. The lobby is elegantly beautiful and there's a shopping arcade downstairs with underground connection to the subway as well. When my younger son decided to help me out by charging my iPod on the floor behind his bed, then leaving it, housekeeping answered my call from the airport to assure me they'd found it. An email when I returned informed me the iPod and charger had been mailed and that there would be no charge, despite my offer to pay. All in all, I loved the Hilton and would happily stay there again.

1,REDACTED,en,3213,"I just want to comment on this hotel based on the other reviews. This is a nice hotel if you get a room on the Executive Floor. If you're not a Gold Member, and you're here for business longer than two nights, then you'll start to miss the typical business amenities.

I stayed here for a week, and had a single bed. I complained because quite frankly, I couldn't sleep in it without feeling like I was going to fall out of bed. I'd never been offered a single bed for business travel in my entire career, so I never expected to see one on my first trip to Tokyo.

I also think that in general, if you are female, and in my case, I am also Asian, I am occasionally subjected to second-class service. I think this is a common complaint by most female executive travelers. But that's a whole other traveling issue. 

Long story short, I am spoiled by American hotels and big comfy beds. Since I travel mostly for work, the bed is the most important part of the room. I don't fault this hotel entirely, but the truth is, I was judged as someone who could tolerate inferior accommodations as compared to my six-foot non-Asian colleague who would have been given the double bed without hesitation.

If you don't fit my profile, you'll probably do fine at this hotel. If you are a Hilton Honors Gold member then you will score high with all the proper business amenities. 

I am terribly disappointed because I have no safe in my room to lock up my electronic gadgets and computer when I'm out at customer meetings. I am disappointed about my bed of course. 

I am disappointed that there is no complimentary coffee in the room (there is coffee you can buy through mini bar for about $6 US, my company doesn't reimburse mini-bar charges either.) 

I am also disappointed that access to the gym will cost me $20 US dollars per use. My company doesn't reimburse for gym fees, so I'd have to shell out $140 of my own money (weeks stay) in order to keep myself in shape for these long haul flights into Asia. 

The food is outrageously expensive. I couldn't get a bowl of fruit for less than $10 us dollars, and it was canned fruit! 

There isn't anything to like about this hotel, and it rates very low compared to US Hilton Hotels for business travel. I have to give it a low score just so other business travelers will be cautious in case they can't get an upgrade to the Executive Floor. The non-Executive floors have very tiny bathrooms, meant for small-framed people. 

Frankly, this hotel should just charge more money and give me what I need rather than nickeling and diming us to death.

What's good about the hotel? 

The airport shuttle
It's clean
The service is decent
It's centrally located

Good luck!

1,REDACTED,en,3214,"First time in Tokyo. The Hilton Tokyo was an excellent place for our first stay in Japan. The staff was very service-oriented and polite. The restaurants are pricey as expected but the quality was top notch. Shinjuku may be a bit sterile but it isn't too far away from less stuffy sections a few blocks away. Views are quite impressive from upper floors. Convenient shuttle from train station.

almost everybody at the counter speaks perfect english. room was adequate and relatively spacious even though i added an extra bed. i had a view of the tennis court which i didn't make much use of though. the toilet, as with all japanese toilets, was wonderful. 

i would definitely recommend a stay there if you're in the mood to splurge. =) btw, the female staff there are really strong. they lifted and carried my extremely heavy luggage like it was a piece of cake. heh.

1,REDACTED,en,3216,"This is a belated review cause I only learnt about the TA and joined as a member last Oct/Nov.

Anyway, I am a HH Gold member and when I checked in, I was given an upgrade immediately, which was good.

The Executive Floor was under renovation so there was a fair bit of noise in the morning but it was OK. The lounge was closed and a makeshift one was provided in one of the rooms on the same floor. Drinks/snacks were limited though.

I notice that the Hilton Group has managed to minimise the influence of local culture on its service style. In this hotel, everyone was businesslike - polite, efficient but somewhat distant. It was not a problem for me as I was on a business trip during this stay. Efficiency ranks high under such circumstances.

I flew into Tokyo from the US on this trip and was running out of clean suits to wear. I decided to use the 4-hour dry cleaning service made available to those on the Executive Floor at no extra charge. The pair of pants came back to me just 15 mins before I had to leave for my business appt. I was in a hurry and didn't manage to check on the condition of my pants prior to leaving the hotel.

You could imagine how embarrassed I was when a Japanese lady on my client's team pointed out that the side pocket of my black pants had white bits stuck on it and the pocket also appeared torn. I thanked her profusely for it must have taken her a lot of courage to point this out to a relative stranger; by Japanese standards, this was bold but only for my good.

I returned to the hotel and the housekeeping people came in the evening for the pants, saying that they would do everything to fix it.

The next day was a saturday and I was out for the most part,when I returned at night, I ddn't see the pants in my room. I went down to talk to the manager at the front desk. He called the housekeeping manager down to see me. He came with the pants but both men didn't apologize; the front desk manager said to me with a straight face - it is fixed now.

When I came back to Singapore and wore the pants again, it was torn at the same place. I travel too much and can't afford the time to take this up with the Hilton mgt, may be I should?

Apart from this incident, the hotel is actually fine, it is in a convenient location. The lobby has got a cafe/bar that is patronised by both locals and foreigners. It has got a nice ambience.

I will probably stay there again - for business, NOT for vacation.

Hope this helps!

1,REDACTED,en,3217,"I stayed here for four nights at the end of January 2007. Shinjuku is a very good base for a tourist, and the Tokyo Hilton the best option in Shinjuku, starting with the fact that the airport limousine bus will drop you right at the hotel - important when you've just got off a long flight and need looking after. The newly refurbished executive floors are simply fantastic and the views amazing - I could see Mount Fuji from my room. The room rate was very reasonable for such a great location in a major world city. Service was excellent in every respect and I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

1,REDACTED,en,3218,"I was in Japan for 3 months and tried 4 other hotels, when my family came to stay with me I booked this Hotel because it was really comfortable, felt more like home than others in Tokyo. It is connected to the Subways via underground tunnels which is nice when it rains. The rooms are very clean and comfortable, and the breakfast buffet is outstanding, best I have had at any hotel and I stay at 25-30 hotels a year. As far as service goes it was beyond anything I've seen. My children started school while we were there and the staff made them special custom room service breakfasts because they left in the morning before the normal operating hours in the dinning room, amazing. Its that kind of service that really makes you feel good when working in foreign countries. Our room views were great, we spent many nights just looking out at the lights and life in Shinjuku. Neighborhood is very safe and clean, my High School and JrH kids explored the amazing architecture and stores within blocks of the hotel, all had a great time and it actually was sad when we had to move out to our new home in Tokyo. Thats a sign a hotel is pretty darn good!

It a 10 minute walk to Shinjuku station where you can take the train to Mt Fuji. Buy the Hakone day pass for about US $35, which allows you to use all the transportation options to and around Mt Fuji including a cruise around Lake Ashi.

There is a closer metro station, Nishi-shinjuku, for travel around town. 

From Narita we took the Friendly airport bus to the hotel. They run about every 30 minutes. It's more convenient than the train and much more economical than a taxi.

Ther hotel was full for the first 2 nights so we were not given our complimentary upgrade but the room was fine, in need of an upgrade but this is to happen soon. On Saturday we went out for the day and returned to find we had been upgraded to the 36th Executive Floor (3rd from the top) and the room was fantastic! Refurbishment was completed in September and the rooms are modern, well designed and the shower is one of the best I've ever used. The attention to detail is great and there are extras like a pillow menu, pajamas and robes which make the stay more enjoyable. The Executive Lounge and service are top class.

The breakfast is the best breakfast ever - so much choice and so delicious! It was the perfect way to start the day. The other meals we ate in the hotel both by room service and in the restaurants were wonderful - try the Singapore Noodles on the Room Service Menu!

The service was of course wonderful, the staff couldn't be more helpful. 

Another bonus was the frequent shuttle bus which went to nearby Shinjuku Station which is a great hub for travel. The hotel is slightly off centre in Tokyo but you can get anywhere you need to within 10 or 15 mins on the JR or Metro (there is a Metro Station on the Red M Line connected to the hotel).

We were in a room on one of the upper levels which had a great view of the surrounding skyscrapers. As gold members we received a few perks - complimentary breakast, tea time and happy hour. The breakfast was delicious with quite a spread to choose from. Tea was a nice variety of snacks with with tea of course. There was a fairly large crowd for happy hour, but we still received great service. The shuttle to the train station was very convenient since we going to be doing quite a bit of walking once we reached our destination. There is not much to do in the surrounding area, so you really do need to go to the station for meals, shopping, etc. We stopped by the front desk with a couple of questions about directions, etc. and they were always very helpful and patient.

Lounge staff were excellent and proactive-eg asking if we wanted maps or late checkout.The room was an executive room and had been tastefully refurbished.I believe the business floors have also been refubished and a sign in the elevators said the deluxe(ordinary) rooms are now being refurbished.
The lounge was spacious with a wide selection of snacks and cocktail service from 5-8pm.On our second day a large group descended on the lounge like a plaque of locusts-everything was gone in a minute.The staff responded admirably bringing a constant stream of fresh snacks and within 5 minutes extra staff arrived to help out.The real test of staff is how they cope in a crisis and here it was first class.

The free bus ends around 11p daily but not to worry, the walk is only 15 mins through a very safe area!

Restaurants at the hotel are expensive but there's a Starbuck's & Denny's half a block away. A side note to fellow Americans, Denny's in Tokyo is much cleaner & food quality is better than in the US!

We ate at Twenty one (French). The food / wine was on par with similar meals in Tokyo. But the service was very spotty for a $600 meal for two.
We also got free breakfast at Checkers. The food was actually very good, with better service than at Twenty One.

The Airport Limousine bus stops right outside the hotel and it operates very frequently. The journey takes about 90 mins but allow longer for traffic delays.

The rooms in this hotel are quite nice. They are not really that modern but they are kept clean. Food and drink is very expensive in the hotel so if your trying to save a few $$$ eat elsewhere. Dennys and starbucks are just around the corner and are much more reasonably priced.

1,REDACTED,en,3228,"I just got back from a 4 week consulting project in Tokyo. The Shinjuku Hilton was a nice choice. If you're lazy you can take their shuttle to Shinjuki station but the walk is less than a mile and usually quite nice unless it's one of those super hot tokyo days.

My corporate rate was $225 or something like that for an exec level room. I'd not waste my money on anything other than exec level.. not if you want to eat or use the gym. The gym had real weights which is nice and there's a decent park caddy cornered to the hilton (across from the Dennys) that you can run around without encountering too much traffic.

The pool, like most things in Japan, is a freak show. They try to get you to wear swimming caps. Which is a little weird since they don't even cover all of your head.

The exec breakfast is good but does get old somewhere around week 2. So pace yourself, be brave, and order some freaky [--] in the little shops on the way to the metro.

There's not much to do in Shinjuku at night except for kabukicho, which is a red light district but does have some nice bars. Nogerian guys will try to get you to come into their ""clubs.""

The only downside is that at night you need to be in Roppongi (Geranimo!) or Shibuya and that's like a $25 cab ride either way. Riding the subway is fine for work but not so good for partying.. if you're going to hit the clubs a lot stay at the ANA.. Even if you just get a weekend room at the ANA and leave most of your stuff at the hilton.

Take money to Tokyo. I had several >$200 bar tabs, and this is not abnormal as drinks run 1,000-1,500 yen (approx $9-14).

The room was big and comfortable but we did not get breakfast, evening drinks nor hors d'oeuvres because we did not stay on the excutive floors. That was alright because we spent our morning at the most amazing fish market in the whole world. The subsequent days, they put us in an executive room. The room was big for Japanese standard but no details were over-looked. The furnitures were a bit dated though. They stock the room with 2 sets of fine british toileteries. We got 2 pajamas and 2 very comfy terry robes which were laid out on our bed everynight when they came and turned the bed down. The slippers were also brought out and put on cloth mats wishing us good night. It wouldn't be Japan without an origami crane on our bed with forecast for the day after. Breakfast buffet was very good at the Hilton Tokyo. They served both Japanese and American breakfast with top quality foods. I enjoyed the Japanese breakfast more because I don't get to eat like that in the States. Happy hours was fantastic at the Hilton Tokyo also. They served champagne, cocktails, and very tasty mini sandwiches or hamburgers, cheeses, cookies, and chocolates. We often didn't have to go eat dinner afterward. The staffs were extremely courteous and helpful. The most polite staffs outside of the Peninsula in Bangkok. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Shinjuku station. The courtesy bus runs frequently between the hotel and the train station. The Nishi Shinjuku subway station is right behind the hotel if you want to get on the red line. The gym, japanese bath, and the pool are free if you stay on the executive floors. So when you check in, insist on staying on the executive floor if you have Gold or more VIP status.

1,REDACTED,en,3230,"My husband and I stayed at here for four nights using HHonors points, and it was a very nice hotel in a good location. However, we had been spoiled by our experience at the Hilton Tokyo Bay earlier in the week, and we didn't feel that this hotel lived up to the same standards, although this hotel was swankier. This was mostly due to the fact that this Hilton treated us differently than the HTB.

We were originally supposed to be upgraded to a room that was on a business floor, but after we returning at the designated time, it was still occupied, and we were given a junior suite on the 23rd floor. However, we were not given access to the executive lounge or given passes for the pool and gym. We also didn't receive free breakfast passes, but were instead given a discount. We didn't bother using it since it still would have been expensive. It was annoying that Hilton didn't have standardized treatment for HHonors members.

The room itself was nice and clean. It was updated, but not as much as the room at the HTB. We had a view of the business area facing the front of the hotel towards Shinjuku. The amenities were almost the same as at the HTB (nice), but I once again wished that the room had an iron and ironing board, as well as a safe, as standard amenities. We requested the iron and ironing board on a daily basis.

The Shinjuku station was an approx. 15-minute walk away, and the shuttle bus made frequent stops, although we wished that it ran past 9:30pm. The TMG building with the free observation area on the 45th floor was two blocks down. However, there weren't a lot of restaurants opened past 8pm because it was located in a business district, so it was difficult trying to get something to eat after returning to the hotel. Denny's, which, to our surprise, didn't serve American food; Starbucks; McDonald's, and Royal Host are some places to grab a bite.

We continued to experience a high level of service, as we did when we arrived earlier in the week at the Hilton Tokyo Bay. The staff was very accommodating. There was a FedEx/Kinko's in the lobby, which had three computers to use for internet access, so that was convenient. The Hiltopia area on the basement floor had various restaurants and high-end shops. We enjoyed our lunch at the tempura restaurant.

Overall, this was a nice place to stay, and I would recommend it. It was just disappointing coming from our earlier experience where we had had more perks, but I doubt this would affect most people.

I shutter to think what I would have paid for these items had they not been comp. The entire staff of the hotel is wonderful and aim to please. You will not wait for anything and they do not expect a tip. If you have never been to Japan, you are in for a real treat as far as attitude and service. NOTHING like what you find in the states. My only complaints were the temperature of the room (they gave me a free fan which cooled it down fast) and the size, but hey, this is Japan and space is at a premium. I had a twin room with two beds. I'm a large guy and fit in the bath tub with no problems, but wasn't able to wear the free bath robe or japanese style sleeping robe that is put on your bed each evening. Make sure to utilize the free shuttle to Shinjuku, but it is less than 10min and an easy walk if you don't. Also, the JTB Sunrise tours can be booked through the hotel and they come pick you up in the lobby at 755am. I highly recommend the Fuji/Hakonne day trip with Sunrise (lunch included and return on the bullet train) which goes for about $150 or the Nikko trip for $130. Tokyo is a great place to visit and can be done quite reasonably money wise if you don't break the bank on 5 star meals. Make sure you wake up early your first night (you'll be up at 3am with jet lag anyways) and get down to the Fish market. The subway opens at about 430 or 5, so be on the first train. Overall, high marks for the Hilton Tokyo for service and no complaints on any ammenity. Another tip..use the airport limosine bus to/from Narita for 3000 yen ($30US). Drops you right at the front door with no hassels of any kind. You buy your ticket at Narita just as you come out of customs and the hotel can book your return. About a 2 hour ride with traffic, but again, don't have to muck about with your luggage or think at all after a long flight.

PROS
- The Japanese style room I stayed in is spacious, comfortable and has a nice Japanese bath tub.
- Staff are very friendly and helpful.
- The complimentary buffet breakfast is excellent in the range of food and quality
- The shuttle to Shinjuku station is convenient (but sadly the last bus departs at 930pm)
- The business facilities is great. Can check email at token charge. Can even print photos from your Digital camera

CONS
- No complimentary crib/bed for small children and the hotel charge a big fee for an extra bed, which is also hard to fit into a cramped normal room. The staff recognized that and suggested me to upgrade to a Japanese style room, the cost is bit more than the extra bed but the room is much larger. Everyone sleeps on futons, which is great experience for kids and very comfortable.
- The entire hotel is actually quite old. Built in 1960's, it impresses you as one from that era. There are not much hi tech facilities in the rooms. However, everything is imaculately clean and is very well maintained (so this is not actually a major con)
- The distance from Shinjuku station on foot is considerable. If you miss the shuttle bus, it is a fair way to walk.
- The air con system is not working well, quite dated design.
- Not much recreational facilities and the health club is quite small and dated.
- The restaurants are VERY EXPENSIVE! (Except the lunch curry buffet, which is mildly expensive)

The hotel provides a free shuttle bus that runs from Shinjuku station to the hotel. There is also a subway stop at the hotel as well! Talk about convenient! Finding the shuttle bus the first time is a little challenging. It might be easier to take a taxi from Shinjuku to the hotel the first time... or take the Airport bus directly to the Hilton. Another thing to remember is that the shuttle bus has limited room for luggage. 

The Shinjuku area of Tokyo is a fun area. Closer to the station there is tons of great shopping, hundreds of restaurants, and more.",5,2004/05/21
2,REDACTED,en,3240,"Westin Tokyo is located at the prime location of the greater Tokyo area, Ebisu. (not city-center, but the center of high-end living) It faces a luxury shopping-dining plaza known as Yebisu Garden Place. I stayed at the hotel during the Christmas time, and both the plaza and the Westin hotel were very nicely decorated. It was definitely the place to be to get in the festive mood. 
As far as the hotel stay experience goes, I can say nothing wrong about the hotel. 
I had an executive room in the Westin Tokyo. The room was good-sized and all the amnesties you could think of were included. The hotel employees were all very polite and very professional. They will go extra miles for you if you need any help. I especially want to give a special shout-out for the staffs at the executive lounge. They were some of the nicest and most attentive people I've met. One time, I casually asked a staff member at the lounge where would be an ideal place to go shopping, the next thing I knew, the staff printed out the best shopping mall area map for me, with subway instructions included. 
There are 4 restaurants (which I know of) in the hotel. I tried the buffet on the first floor. The selection of food was good and price was reasonable. If you are SPG member (I think need to be gold at least?), talk to the staff ahead of time, they will give you discount on the breakfast. 
Finally, there is a wi-fi inclusive shuttle service from the hotel to both Haneda and Narita airports. To Haneda is about 900 Yen, and to Narita is about 3000 Yen. Considering the convenience and comfort, probably the best option to and from the airport. (The shuttle departs from the hotel to the airport every hour or so, but there are only 2 or 3 shuttles which picks people up from airport daily. Read details on their website)",5,2018/01/11
2,REDACTED,en,3241,"On vacation for anniversary stayed at Westin. From the moment we arrived everyone has been very helpful. The room is spacious and the view is remarkable. Amenities are plentiful. The buffet is international with something for everyone and all ages. The location is perfect, offering shopping, eating, sightseeing, and time to relax in the park. Easy access to subway. Although you can hear more noise from your neighbor inside the hotel than outside, it is still a great place to stay.",5,2017/06/25
2,REDACTED,en,3242,"Overall good location right in the heart of Ebisu station with access to all train systems.

However, after reading the reviews and visiting other Westin hotels around the world this was a disappointment. The room is dark, furniture dated and the service wasn’t up to the standards of other establishments in Tokyo. Not the best start to our Japanese trip. I also have status and the club level breakfast also wasn’t great. 

If they remodeled maybe I would come here again but with such great hotels in Tokyo (Points Guy did a great blog on this) I would skip the Westin Tokyo.",3,2018/01/10
2,REDACTED,en,3243,"This hotel was quite nice and I very much enjoyed my stay. It was not well located for my meetings, or even any of the restaurants that interested me, but it was not badly out of the way. This hotel was normal Westin quality. You won’t be disappointed.",4,2018/01/09
2,REDACTED,en,3244,"We stayed here over the new year, being a SPG Gold member, the hotel gave welcome gift of fresh fruits and 2 bottles of VOS water. Room is good size and clean although it is a bit dated.

Location is a bit further from the city center.
The nearest subway (metro) station is Ebitsu, an easy 5-7 minutes walk via the covered travellator. From Ebitsu is just a one or two stations away to reach Ginza/Shinjuku/Harajuku. If this is your first time in Tokyo, would not recommend you stay here and be a little far from the where the actions are.

2,REDACTED,en,3245,"Perhaps my expectations were a bit too high when I booked otur stay here. I was disappointed to see the dated decor which really looked like the 80s. I did not receive any special recognition as a Platinum SPG nor was I welcomed as oen. The hotel was probably too busy to think of such issues for the loyal guests. The description was that the rooms were 42 square meters but really didn't feel so. Staff were overall good specially the concierge and guest services. However breakfast was a terrible situation with long queues stretching in the lobby. Items were finished and replacement was not done swiftly. many items were very cold even. It was evident the staff were unable
to cope up with the pressure. Similarly the situation was pathetic in the lounge and we were told to wait till we could enter it or else to take the food out with us to our rooms. The location was again an issue for us as it was in a quiet area quite far away from the places we wanted to visit like Ginza etc. The nearest metro station was almost like one kilometer away. Overall it was not the right choice for us and we checked out earlier than our date to shift to another place more central and much more new.",3,2018/01/06
2,REDACTED,en,3246,"This hotel is a property located in the Ebisu area of Tokyo, which is served by the Ebisu JR station conveniently located on the Yamanote Line. The issue, as many reviewers have mentioned, is that the station is some distance away. For able-bodied travellers like us, it is a 10-min brisk walk from the hotel, first underground, then connecting across the road to a skywalk (with travellators) which takes you directly to the station. For experienced Tokyo-ites, the Yamanote Line will take you to many of the most popular places in Tokyo eg Shinjuku, Shibuya, Asakusa, Akiba, etc. For those who cant walk far, taking a taxi might be the only option. A Mitsukoshi department store is opposite the hotel, but apart from the convenience, I cannot imagine why any tourist would want to shop there when there are so many other much more attractive and interesting shopping areas in and around Tokyo.

I didn't find the decor overly old-fashioned but can imagine why some do. We did get a reasonably quiet room and were able to rest well on comfortable beds at night. The morning breakfast does have a bit of a line sometimes, and the Japanese food selection really wasnt up to our expectations. The gym: I would call it reasonably well-equipped simply because unlike many other hotels, it has a bench press! You also get free weights, but not much else (not counting the cardio machines which are de riguer). Forget about chin-up bars or smith machines. A pec-deck machine and a lat pulldown just about rounds up what's available. You will get by with a reasonable workout if you don't expect too much.

Overall, the place felt well-managed but impersonal, and just doesn't have the magic and character to get 5 stars from this reviewer.",4,2018/01/05
2,REDACTED,en,3247,"We usually like to stay in new hotels when visiting Tokyo, 
This hotel has been around since the early 90s, as yet, the hotel rooms are very clean and spacious. Hotel staffs are very friendly and helpful.
The surrounding can provide you a good choice of different food.
The only drqwback is , the htoel is a little bit far from the train station and if you are a rapid shopper, this might not be the hotel that you like to stay.
Try to book the deluxe room breakfast package (if still available) and you can enjoy having breakfast at one of the four restaurants in the hotel.",4,2018/01/04
2,REDACTED,en,3248,"My husband and I just returned from a 10 day trip to Japan including stops in Tokyo, Kyoto and Hakone. We stayed at the Westin for a total of 6 nights both at the beginning and end of our trip. The Westin is located conveniently near the Ebisu stop on the JR Rail in addition to access to the subway at the back side of the rail station. The train station, although a 7-9 minute or so walk can easily be done entirely inside from the basement of the Westin through the connected Yebisu Garden Palace with moving walkways which leads right into the station. The JR Yamanote line connected us to much of Tokyo easily. We took the rail all but on a few occasions in the evening where cabs were easy to access from the front of the hotel. In addition, there are tons of restaurants within a stones throw of the hotel in the Yebisu Garden Place in addition to a department store with a small food hall in the basement. We took advantage of the restaurants in this area on two occasions as we were exhausted from our long days touring and wanted a nice bite, without having to take the rail too far. The restaurants are located on the 38th and 39th floor with great views of the city. The Westin has a beautiful lobby, attentive staff and clean and well appointed rooms. We stayed in two excellent rooms that were spacious, having a king bed and sitting area and large bathroom with stall shower and bathtub. Both rooms was also appointed with all the bathroom amenities, hairdryer and soaps and included complementary coffee and tea. We had a drink one evening at the restaurant on the 22 floor, although the service was terrible and they entirely messed up our order, they comped the drinks and apps as a result. Couldn't have asked for better service or the appropriate response. The view from the restaurant is stunning. We did not dine in any of the other restaurants on site, although there are many. We only ate one morning at the breakfast buffet which offers both Western and traditional Japanese breakfast. We took advantage of all the amazing places to visit in Tokyo instead. Overall amazing stay. Would highly recommend as a fabulous luxury hotel in a beautiful part of the city. We hope to visit again!",5,2018/01/04
2,REDACTED,en,3249,"Stayed for both short vacation followed by business trip. This hotel is a very nice and posh areas, not too crowded, lots of restaurants, a Yebisu beer museum and about a 10min walk to JR/Tokyo Metro station with a supermarket.

2,REDACTED,en,3250,"Stayed at the Imperial Suite with a connecting room with my whole family, including my 94 years old father and a teen daughter. As we had many visitors visit us during our stay, having a comfortable living, dining, and kitchen was most helpful to entertain the visitors and still have our own space when necessary. The club lounge was comfortable to relax during the early evening for a light drink with family. I had 8 senior citizen guests over for lunch at our suite and ordered Shoka Bento box from their Japanese restaurant which was delivered on time, the food was delicious, and the setting on the dining table was done so professionally impressing my guests. I found their room service staffs to be very professional and hospitable. The breakfast buffet at the coffee shop was quite good but the staffs seemed a little over worked as the hotel was running at nearly 100 % occupancy. The gym was self sufficient giving my wife and I enough machines to work on our cardio. The location of the hotel is in the quite side of Ebisu which gives you a feeling of returning to your home. The nearest JR Ebisu station is a short walking distance and taxis are always available. The service at the front desk, concierge, housekeeping, and bell desk is all good. All in all I always find Westin Tokyo to be a comfortable hotel for my self and my family to stay. Really value for money. The only complaint if I were to have is the hotel's corresponding skills. If you need something, just call them as writing and getting a response could be a great challenge.",4,2018/01/01
2,REDACTED,en,3251,"Came here after a very underwhelming stay at the Westin in Kyoto. This property is what I expect from the Westin brand. 

Room was comfortable and the bathroom palatial by Japanese standards. 

Location is okay with access to the Yamanote line reasonably close at Ebisu station. Lots of food options around Ebisu and was able to walk to Ippudo Ramen from the hotel (via Ebisu station). 

As is the case with Japan, the staff were excellent and efficient. 

Only stayed 1 night, however would recommend",4,2018/01/01
2,REDACTED,en,3252,"This hotel shouts quality the minute you walk in the front door and receive a personalised service at reception.
I’ve stayed at this hotel twice for approx 20 days and rooms are high quality and very comfortable. One of the best features is the breakfast but equally their restaurant has a superb varied menu. Just off the reception is an exit which connects to a walkway linking you to shops, restaurants and theatres.
Very useful during inclement weather as a dry route to all these facilities. Hotel rates are reasonable and i highly recommend this hotel as one of the best I’ve stayed in Japan.",5,2018/01/01
2,REDACTED,en,3253,"As a recent SPG Platinum member I've saved most of my Suite Night awards to apply at this hotel for a Christmas holiday for the family many months in the planning. To my horror days before the trip I received emails saying that my Suite Night awards shall not be honoured. To make matters worse, I caught a bad cold just before the trip and had to cancel Christmas dinner reservations at the hotel's teppanyaki grill. Feeling rather blue when I checked in, I was pleasantly surprised that although I didn't get a suite the hotel arranged to let me have an Exec room on a high floor with a view of Mt Fuji. It is a sight that is very pleasing especially sunrise and sunset - I don't get tired of viewing it. Something nice and unexpected was an air cleanser in the room, to help safeguard my family's health even though I was down with the cold and no doubt spreading germs. The staff from the check in, to the lounge, had all been immaculately polite and helpful, and kept apologising about the Suite Awards. In particular I would like to mention Yukiko Kakutani for being helpful and sympathetic. My only lament is that I don't get to try the hotel's suite product, and also 7 suite award nights are all going to waste because it is already the year end.
Nevertheless I shall still give this review five stars because it is the people working in the hotel that makes the experience.",5,2017/12/26
2,REDACTED,en,3254,"Stayed 4 nights in a club room in October. As others have said, decor is a little old fashioned but that did not matter. Rooms are very comfortable and of a good size. The club lounge is very good with great views over Tokyo. The lounge got very business in the evenings but service was attentive and there is a good selection of drinks and hot and cold food options available. They also have a self service jelly bean dispenser which is a cool touch. We decided to take breakfast in the main restaurant rather than in the lounge. Selection was extensive and of good quality with a good mix of western, Arabic and eastern options.
Location wise the hotel is not super central but is a 7-10 min walk to the metro and train station and the local area of Ebisu itself has a good buzz with plenty of good, reasonably priced eating options. 
Would recommend this hotel as a good base for exploring Tokyo.",5,2017/12/25

There are a few locations that consistently deliver best-in-class client service and the Westin Tokyo is one of those locations. I spend roughly two weeks in total each year at this hotel for the past several years and it cannot be beat on friendliness and service. Two representatives of this best-in-class servicing are Satoshi Itoyama (front office senior agent) and Ai Watanabe (concierge). Truly exceptional professionals. If you are at the Westin Tokyo and you need anything, just ask for them. Ai and Satoshi always deliver!",5,2017/12/15

Location - quiet area, 15 minutes' leisurely walk to nearest train/subway (Ebisu), 2 minutes to classy restaurants and Mitsukoshi department store at Yebisu Garden Place. Nearest convenience store 8 minutes' walk away. Accessible underground from train/subway in case of bad weather.

Lobby - large and elegant.

Rooms - large and spacious, decor a little dated, generally well-cleaned. Do put your trash in the bins - empty drink cans/used tissue is not cleared if left on the table. Wifi mostly worked well, although several rooms had poor/no connection throughout. Limited channels for entertainment - plenty of home shopping networks and sports, and for English, mostly news channels. Property advocates eco-friendliness, so linen changes are upon request. Smoking allowed on our floor, and windows can be opened slightly. Firm beds, 4 pillows for 2 pax - 1 medium, 1 soft.

Breakfast - had 2 options; either international buffet at the Terrace or Japanese at Mai. Only tried the Terrace - quite a large variety of breads, generally good variety of international cuisine, although no changes during our 4 days here.

The Narita Airport Limousine Bus also stops here - definitely a more affordable alternative to taxis.

Only person that provided excellent service was Masami Okada. She went above and beyond for my colleagues and I. If it wasn't for her, we would of been stuck at out job site 1-2hrs longer and no way to transport our gear back. Masami called us from her personal cell(she was off-shift) to ensure that we arrived back safely. She made our work trip easier and provided some excellent restaurants to eat at!! Breakfast buffet had a good selection to choose from. Only thing you have to worry about is getting a seat if you come after 8am, since seating area is small. Room size was good and one of the cleanest hotel rooms in Japan I have seen. Shower area was small and kept on hitting my elbows allot. Bed was comfortable but the pillows were small and didn't have anymore big pillows since hotel was fully booked. If need to catch a train, it's about 7-10 minute walk from hotel.",4,2017/12/04
2,REDACTED,en,3261,"My husband and myself, during our visit to Japan, decided to spend few nights in Tokyo in Westin Hotel, (30/11-3/12) firstly for its reputation, secondly because as SPG Platinum member we had few remaining points to spend.The welcome was good, and a complementary upgrade was given, so for suite nights. Everything seemed ok, great, until when, during the last night at the top floor bar, the Compass Rose, we had to wait one hour for a couple of sanwiches, served overall with 15 mnts between one and the other. Disapponted ( 50€ for two sandwhiches one beer and some water) we complained,we received many apologizes..nothing else.
But the ""cherry on the cake"" has been when checking out I realized that under the the linen on the materass cover there was a blood stain from some previous customer.
I didn't spot it at first time, and my husband thought it was a materass logo..
For 3 nights , we don't ask normally to change linen ( reasonable green attitude), and in Westin we don't think we need to check linen....
Blood of someone else...Unacceptable.
We referred this to the housekeeper supervisor, who embarassed called immediatly the Manager, who was unable to speak a single word in English and gave us only ome apologizes, repeated, and translated by the supervisor.

Hotel is in a good location, with JR, subway station, several shopping malls all are within 10-min-walking distance! Yebisu Garden is just cross the road, a peaceful area where you can wander around after dinner and enjoy the lighting of Christmas Trees! Please don't forget to take photos!!! Location is always my priority when selecting hotels! Shinjuku, Ginza are very popular for travelers to stay, but for me they are too busy and crowded. Here is convenient while comfortable, you can enjoy more quality time here! Trust me!

Hotel staffs here are super! Very courteous and helpful! From the bellman who helped with our luggage upon arrival, to reception staffs to housekeeping! I like their sincere smiles and hospitality from heart! Thank you thank you again!

Meanwhile, I would like to say special thanks to Mr Yamasaki and his team on 17 floor! Please reserve your room on Executuve Floor, without any regret!!! You can enjoy breakfast, tea & snacks and evening cocktail in the lounge where you can enjoy the city view, even can see Tokyo Tower!!! Everything is just so perfect!! Service is professional here, all staffs are cheerfully and always ready to help! Thank you Mr Yamasaki again, he's definitely a valuable asset to this hotel!!

If you book rooms on Executive Floor, your room will be assigned on high floors of the hotel. I was staying on 18 floor, view of my room is super! You can use Bose in room to enjoy music and make coffee by nesprsso machine to start your day! Though room design and furniture are a bit outdated, the service and facilities will make it up!!

I will stay with Westin Tokyo in all my future visits and high recommend to my friends! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!!!! I will back for sure!

2,REDACTED,en,3264,"Finding a good hotel in Tokyo is tough, especially coming from Southeast Asia. However, the Westin has been good to me almost every time. 
It’s not the most modern place - it’s slightly nostalgic and some features such as their furniture choices are reminiscent of the back in the day. 
It is, however, a welcoming, warm, cozy hotel that helps me relax at the end of a long work day. 
It just does the job. 
I’m looking for my next stay.",5,2017/11/25
2,REDACTED,en,3265,"Westin is my go to hotel chain whenever I travel. In my experience, they have the most consistent level of quality and service. It could also be that I've been brainwashed by their signature White Tea scent that breeds familiarity no matter the Westin I go to.

Either way, I decided to cash in some SPG points and make the Westin Tokyo my base of operations for my family on a recent 7 day trip.

Here are the 9 things you need to know, along with 1 thing I hated.

1. Yebisu Garden Place

Arriving in the evening and suffering from jetlag, my first impression was that there was nothing around the hotel. I couldn't have been more wrong. Right across the street is a massive complex called Yebisu Garden Place. It's a mixed use business, art, shopping and restaurant district. Lots of open space and doesn't get too crowded. There's a high end department store (sort of like Sak's Fifth Avenue), a Starbucks, a convenience store, a pharmacy, a Burger King, and a whole bevy of restaurants to choose from. There's even a separate building of Joel Robuchon famed restaurants, one of them with 2 Michelin stars I believe. Underground in ""Glass Square"" you have a wide selection of udon, izakaya, French, American and sushi restaurants. In the highrise on the 38th and 39th floors, you have some really outstanding restaurants. I recommend the Yakiniku place Jojoen. A stunning night view of the city, with top notch meats grilled in front of you. Service is immaculate. Another nice place is a tempura restaurant, the name escapes me. You get a fixed menu multi course of the most delicious tempura that you've never had. Forget what you think you know about tempura. Besides the food, they also had a farmer's market on the Sunday afternoon filled with small vendors and handcrafted delights like honey, baked goods and more.

2. Train a 15 minute walk

One small downside is the long walk to the Ebisu train station for the JR Yamamote line. But it's not so bad because the majority of it is via automated walkways that are covered. From there, you can make your way to almost any part of Tokyo for a few dollars. We used it to go to the north part of Tokyo, as well as another trip connecting through Shinjuku station to visit the Sanrio Puroland (Hello Kitty land). It's far cheaper than taxis which can easily run you $40 to $50...each way.

3. Nice Executive Lounge

If you can get booked on an executive floor, you get access to the 17th floor Executive Lounge. They didn't really check our room number often, so I wonder if others could have snuck in. But the best part of the lounge is the daily breakfast buffet. Selection is quite good with both Japanese and Western style food. One of the most notable aspects was the freshly squeezed juices. Fresh fruits, pastries, eggs, congee, oatmeal, juices...everything your heart desires. It's a great way to start the day on a good foot. The views from the lounge are nice as well.

4. Impeccable Service

Japan in general provides the most polite and thoughtful service of any place I've been in the world. Of course, the Westin would continue that tradition. From Service Express to the concierge to the doormen to the bellboys/bellgirls...every interaction was pleasant and competent.

5. Quiet Area

This particular Westin is located in the Meguro/Ebisu district of southwest Tokyo. It's a bit off the beaten path, 15 minutes south of Shibuya, 30 minutes from Shinjuku or the center of the city. But it's a quiet area away from the hustle and bustle of skyrises. It looks to be a high income area based on the looks of the residents walking around. I found it to be a welcome respite from the city.

6. Not so Comfy Beds

Unfortunately the beds weren't quite to my liking. The sheets were rustling and loud. The top comforter was heavy. The existing pillows were flat. I requested a foam pillow which was much better. The mattress was a bit firm for me, but I'm sure others would find it fine. I realize that bed comfort is a personal choice, so YMMV.

7. Decent Wifi and Power Outlets

A pleasant surprise was the speed and consistency of the WiFi. Executive floor rooms have free WiFi with unlimited devices, and the speed was quite good for email, web surfing and even some light online gaming. Streaming audio via Spotify was a bit spottier, but still usable. I appreciated the two power outlets by the bedside lamp for charging of my phone.

8. Nearby Groceries

Within the basement of the nearby Yebisu Garden Place is a Familymart type store where you can buy bottled water, food, snacks, beverages, packaged fresh foods and more. The pharmacy on the main level (Tomas) has a wide assortment of medicine, but they are almost all in Japanese. NOTE: Japan does not sell Pepto-Bismol. Bring your own if that's your medicine of choice.

9. Heated Toilet Seats

I've fallen in love with heated toilet seats and jet water sprays. Don't judge.

10. Mysterious Thumping

The one annoying downside to my stay was this regular thumping and loud noises that seemed to come from above me, no matter the time of day. At first I thought it was a guest, but it was too frequent and constant for that. I actually went up from our 20th floor to the 21st floor and found nothing out of the ordinary there. The sounds led me to believe it was from a service room or storage area. But another floor up on the 22nd are a couple of top notch restaurants (French and Teppanyaki). It's possible the sounds I hear are tables and chairs being moved around. Whatever it was, it was highly annoying.",5,2017/11/24

2,REDACTED,en,3267,"Stayed with my wife one night on a long layover. This is definitely one of the more luxurious properties in the Westin brand, but the design feels like a 5* hotel from the '90s (e.g., colored marble, light wood, plush carpet). That said, the location, views, and breakfast were solid. While we only had one night/day in the city, it was a great launching point. We'd stay again.",4,2017/11/23

Concierge helps us to book the Yebisu teppanyaki and it was a nice lunch experience with my family. It is a walking distance from JR Ebisu station about 10 minutes. I drank at the Compass Rose.

2,REDACTED,en,3276,"The Westin in Tokyo is my go to spot. I've been here a couple of times now. There are trains near by and easy enough to make it to all of the touristy spots. I think it might be better for business as it is not the most convenient location though, especially if you have kids with you. However, it is a beautiful property. The hotel has an older decor that is timeless and very tasteful. 

Is it one of the better SPG lounges that I've been to since they have more food & drink options. 

One thing I noticed while in Japan is, it's really difficult to get upgrades from being a Platinum member. While the staff is very courteous, and the lounge is great, I feel like they don't really acknowledge your loyalty with them. I'd still come back as it is a good hotel.",4,2017/10/30

We would recommend booking Club facilities as there are several good benefits including: three options for breakfast: a complimentary superb buffet breakfast or French Restaurant or Exec breakfast option.....

The onsite Chinese Restaurant was very expensive with unimpressive quality and tiny portion sizes - not good value for money. The Japaese restaurant was much better.",5,2017/10/28
2,REDACTED,en,3278,Westin Tokyo had great rooms and nice public areas and lobbies. My only issue was when so arrived late evening my first night. I wanted a quick bite so I went down to the restaurant on the main floor and they had a fairly mediocre buffet. The cost of the buffet with a bottle of sparkling water was over $100!,4,2017/10/26
2,REDACTED,en,3279,"We checked in to the Westin Tokyo after originally staying at the Cerulean Tower in Shibuya. We left Cerulean after finding out it was not family friendly at all, and faced extremely horrendous customer service. We were looking for another nice hotel option that would give true 5 star service while still being in a great location. The Westin in Ebisu delivered. 

I was traveling with my wife and 11 month old baby, and this hotel catered towards families. They offered nice large rooms, baby cribs, along with high chairs at the breakfast buffet. They were so warm and welcoming and had no problems with us bringing our babies to the restaurants, both lobby buffet along to the wonderful Teppanyaki restaurant upstairs.This might seem like standard service, since it basically is at every other SPG property I've stayed at, but after coming from the Cerulean where they didn't allow babies even at the breakfast buffet, the way Westin treated us, we felt right at home & really appreciated this even more. 

The hotel property itself is beautiful. Has a very nice comfortable lobby, and the restaurants were great. Their breakfast buffet was probably the best hotel breakfast buffet I've eaten at. The hotel design/decor had a nice classic European feel to it. The rooms itself were nice, clean, and great size. The rooms could use some updating, as it is one of the older Westin's I think I've stayed at, but still was very nice. The only amenity I wish they had that they didn't would be a swimming pool & hot tub to take our baby on a warm day. But being in a big city, it definitely wasn't a deal breaker. 

Some people complain about distance to the station, but we didn't find this to be a problem at all. The hotel is located right by a nice mall/shopping center, and there is a nice walking path that has the power walking ramps that speeds up the walk if you take those. Think it was only about a 7 minute walk. Really wasn't bad at all. The Ebisu station and mall had some cool shops/restaurants, plus the downtown area of Ebisu was nice and had a lot of good options there as well. I was actually here for work, and the office was in Shibuya, hence staying at Cerulean initially. However, it was just 1 stop from the Shibuya station on the JR line and I got to my office in about the same amount of time when I was actually staying in Shibuya. 

Being a loyal SPG member, I have to say, I've never had a bad experience with a Starwood brand hotel, and with that, I think this Westin gave my best experience to date. I will be back to Tokyo for work, and I'm happy to say I'll be booking the Westin again for my future travels.",5,2017/10/18

The service and quality at the Westin Tokyo are excellent, and a great value for 30,000 yen per night. Rooms are a bit outdated, but very well maintained. I've been in large, clean and comfortable rooms both stays. Executive lounge is first class, and they now offer additional breakfast options for SPG Elite members which was a bonus. Concierge is extremely helpful getting dinner reservations in advance of your stay, or during. Many restaurants are small with limited seating so I suggest booking in advance.

Staff were very accommodating, and in true Japanese style, were always willing to go that little but above and beyond. The hotel is very centrally located and within easy walking distance to restaurants, shops and bars. 
The bed was comfortable, the room service was good and the bar was average stocked. Great toiletry options and if you stay for over a week they also upgrade the toiletries along with offering a few other additions such as discounted laundry, a spa pillow, flowers, yoga mat and a few other things. 
The spa was absolutely amazing. I wish I had gone back but it was also very expensive. Well worth at least one visit though. I recommend late afternoon, followed by room service and an early night - what Anna amazing sleep I had that evening! 
I recommend the Westin and would return. The one downside was the smell of cigarette smoke throughout the hotel. I'm told they are banning smoking indoors for the upcoming Olympics so hopefully this will help to change the culture and the smell.",4,2017/10/03

The hotel by itself is great - classic luxury type, impeccable cleanliness like in Sheraton Yokohama.

The food is good not great - from Chinese Cantonese, Japanese to international cuisine, but the price is not commensurate with the offering, but hotel is usually full so I guess no one really cares.

There one left to try the teppanyaki ... will be able to compare with the beautiful teppanyaki restaurant at the Yokohama Sheraton.

PS it is one of the rare place in a luxury hotel in the world when someone in the cuisine seems to count the piece of bread you are being served - like one slice of bread in a 4000 yens breakfast - F&B manager should fix this asap!",4,2017/10/01

2,REDACTED,en,3303,"We stayed at Westin Tokyo for 2 nights before heading to Tokyo Disneyland. 

We choose Westin because I want to use SPG suite night award, and out of all the other SPG hotel in Tokyo, Westin has great trip advisor rating, located near JR/metro, and is near shopping mall. 

These are the reasons... But
1. Westin is located ""near"" by Ebisu Station but it's quite a long walk if young ones aren't cooperating... It's around 10-15 min walk. Not all the walk is underground or cover with overhead so if rain you might be wet. 

2. Shopping center is small and nothing much to buy for kids.. 

Overall Westin is still a good place to stay. 
Our room was upgraded to suite. Suite is very spacious and when traveling with kids, it's great to have separate living room and bed room. Kids tooth paste were provided too! 

The concierge was very helpful in providing us directions 

Breakfast at lobby (buffet) was better than at 22nd floor (forgot name of the restaurant) when you are with kids. There are variety of food in buffet restaurant, and my favorite is the noddle 


Two things I think Westin can be better is
1. Kid's club- I know not all Westin has it, but I but it will be great 
2. Offer more than 2 bottles of complimentary water... In other hotels we stayed at, usually the house keeping will provide extra bottles of water because they understand kids drink formula milk and uses up a lot of water. Maybe it's in Japan (?) that complimentary water is not common?, we stayed at Disneyland Hotel and no bottle water was provided. 
",4,2017/08/26
2,REDACTED,en,3304,"I've stayed here on business trips 5 times over the past year. The rooms are big (enormous by Japanese standards), well appointed, and maintained beautifully. The staff is always very friendly and helpful and efficient. The extensive brunch has something delicious for everyone and the neighborhood offers some great options for meals throughout the day. I particularly like the neighborhood - a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of more urbanized parts of Tokyo but very accessible to everything. Grateful for the 24 hour room service too.",5,2017/08/26
2,REDACTED,en,3305,"The Westin Tokyo is adjacent to the Yebisu Garden Place. This puts it within easy access of the train station that connects around Tokyo (station is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel, connected by walkways). 
Check-in was efficient and welcoming. My husband and I arrived about noon, before check-in time, but the desk personnel asked for a few minutes to secure a room for us. After about a 15 minute wait were were taken to our room. Room was comfortable, pleasant size, with good amenities. We had a view of Yebisu Garden Place. 
Since we were out and about most of the time, we did not use any of the Westin's restaurants, except one night we had drinks and a light meal in the Compass Rose lounge on the 22nd floor. The view was beautiful and the service/food good.
Some may find the hotel style dated, but I liked the comfort of the furnishings (all in good condition) and the setting. A direct bus from the airport stops at the hotel.",4,2017/08/21
2,REDACTED,en,3306,"I have stayed here many times, however I'd have to say this stay was 90% disappointing. The lady who checked us in advised that I'd been upgraded but I can assure that there is no way the room assigned was an upgrade - it was the oldest, dated room that I have ever seen in this hotel, and in my mind most certainly a downgrade compared to the room I booked. Yes I understand that August is one of the busiest months of the year, but the hotel should at minimum respect the type of room booked, whether SPG platinum or not. In my mind, some manager thought they could deceive us as overseas tourists. When I called reception they then later offered a better room on the SPG floor. My everlasting memory of this hotel will be the attitude of the staff; only Saitomi-San, who worked in the executive lounge and at breakfast had a pleasant, happy demeanour; almost everyone else seemed like they were sentenced to hard labour in prison. I did have an accident in the room at this hotel, which was partly the hotel's fault and partly my own fault, however frankly the attitude of the management who handled it was very poor. I didn't expect anything except the management to at least check on the guests condition rather than leave a few chocolates from the lounge and a bar of L'Occitane soap in the room. Overall a great pity, but based on this visit I will never return.",3,2017/08/17
2,REDACTED,en,3307,"This was my first time at the Westin Tokyo, so I was looking forward to an enjoyable time at this Starwood property. I arrived around 4pm and checkin was prompt and courteous. The front desk assistant told me I had been upgraded to a slightly larger room, so it was nice to be appreciated as an SPG Platinum member. The room was not a suite this time, but still spacious and clean. The bed was super comfortable, the room and bathroom were exceedingly clean and the room smelled nice. What the room lacked was decent lighting. Even with all the lights on, it was still too dark inside the room. The other thing I did not like a lot about the room -- and this is a purely personal thing -- is the dated design. Carpet, furniture, furnishings and bathroom are old fashioned. This being said, everything in the room was spotlessly clean and I had excellent sleep quality. It was surprising to find out that I did not get turndown service and there was no complimentary fresh fruit in the room. These are things I always get at Starwood properties and I found it quite strange the Westin Tokyo did not offer that.

As part of the SPG perks I was entitled to complimentary breakfast at the different breakfast venues throughout the hotel. I tried three of them. First one was Victor's, the upscale restaurant on the top floor. They offer a set menu for breakfast, from which I chose the steak and egg combo, with the bread basket. Quality of the food and the service were excellent, so I am giving top marks for this place. The breakfast buffet on the ground floor offers the typical things you would find at any luxury hotel. Quality of the food was good again and the service was it should be. At one point, a waitress had cleared my table when I was off to the buffet. This was a small mistake for which she apologised. The breakfast at the Executive Club on the 22nd floor was a bit of a letdown. The choice is disappointingly limited and this is the one venue I would not return to.

The Westin Tokyo offers free ""Cocktail Hour"" from 5:30pm till 7:30pm at their Executive Lounge. The first afternoon of my stay I went and ordered a Mai Tai cocktail. They gave me a bit of an odd look, but eventually turned up with a Mai Tai. Things turned very weird the following day. I went back to the Executive Lounge, took a seat and... nothing happened. Not one single waiter came to me to ask what I wanted to drink. Only after 20 minutes had passed, somebody came to me to take my order. I asked for a Margarita cocktail and off went the waitress. After 10 minutes she returned and told me they could not make me one. I asked her then which cocktails they could offer and she told me ""Only gin tonic"". As it seemed odd to me that for an advertised ""Cocktail hour"", they only offered a gin tonic, I approached the manager Mr. Masaki Ikeno, who could only say ""Sorry"" and gave me his business card. I got quite frustrated by this and went down to the lobby bar where I got my cocktail eventually. I emailed Mr. Charles Jack, the hotel's GM with my remarks on the substandard service. As Mr. Jack was out of town, his assistant Mr. Yasunari Kaji spoke to me the next day at the Executive Lounge. He apologised for what happened and told me they were retraining their staff. Still I think if you pay that amount of money for a hotel room, guests should get correct service without having to resort to contacting management.

One morning I asked the front desk attendant if I could go for a swim. She told me the hotel does not have a pool, that guests can use the pool at Ebisu Garden Palace for a slight fee. That slight fee turned out to be 2500 JPY for a swim, which I found totally unacceptable. Even though a five star hotel should have its own pool, I can understand the Westin does not have one due to historic reasons. Still charging guests for pool use seems ludicrous to me. I mentioned my objections as well to Mr. Yasunari Kaji, who gave me two complimentary entry tickets to the pool. Unfortunately by then I had other things to do in the morning, so I could not use those tickets.

The other annoying issue I had was with the use of outside space. There is a patio at the hotel, linked to their restaurant. One morning the weather was fine and I asked the concierge if I could use the outside space to do some work outdoors on my laptop. She told me I could go to the public park across the street, which once again was totally unacceptable to me. I did not want to argue or complain anymore, so I just left and took a mental note of the reply I got.

Wireless internet in my room seemed to be iffy, cutting out frequently, particularly during the last two days of my stay. I had to resort to using the 4G on my phone in order to get internet access.

All things considered I was not overly impressed with my stay at the Westin Tokyo. On the positive side, the room was very clean and quiet and the breakfast service at Victor's and the buffet was excellent. However, the many glitches I encountered during my stay and the fact that I had to complain to higher management before anything was done about it, made the Westin one of the less memorable Starwood properties I have stayed at. Considering they charge 300 USD a night for a basic room, they really should clean up their act and match the level of service that is provided at so many other luxury hotels. They also need to realise that there is an awful lot of AirBnB properties in the exact same neighbourhood, which provide clean and quiet rooms for less than a third of what the Westin charges. If this hotel wants to distinguish itself from a typical AirBnB place in the same neighbourhood, it can only do so by providing top notch service to their guests. This is where the differentiating factor and the price difference becomes justified. If that does not happen, I really do not see the point in shelling out an additional 200 USD a night.",3,2017/08/14

I went to the buffet restaurant one night and food was good and service was quick. While I recommend trying the tastes of the city, the hotel options if you want to dine in are perfect.

2,REDACTED,en,3310,"I recently stayed at the Westin Tokyo for a weekend after a week of work closer to downtown Tokyo. I was pleasantly surprised at the luxuriousness of this Westin! The lobby area is gorgeous with huge windows overlooking the gardens that surround the hotel. Rooms are large and well appointed- everything you need is in here- coffee/tea/water - hairdryer- iron - and all the bath amenities you could possibly need. 

The staff all speak English (which is not a given in Tokyo) and are very helpful. The hotel is a short walk from a main train station- and there are moving sidewalks to help you get to the train station even quicker. Also there are shops, restaurants and a beer museum (with tasting area) outside the front entrance of the Westin.

The sushi restaurant in the Westin is just OK- but the Chinese restaurant is one of the best in the city. Breakfast buffet in the lobby level restaurant is very good and offers a wide assortment of foods. 

There is a comfy bar on the lobby level as well on the 22nd floor with great views.

Also- there is a great workout room and the spa offers facials/massages and has a very nice hot tub and water lounge area. 

This is a perfect hotel for a weekend getaway- you can either stay and relax in the hotel or the location is convenient for shopping or taking the train to anywhere in the city. I highly recommend this Westin property and hope to get back here again.",5,2017/07/29

Concierge services were also excellent - helped us make all travel and tour arrangements and made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our visit. 

The Breakfast buffet was also very good, but at about $35 each there are many other options locally including the small cafe at the far end of Ebisu Garden Place.

2,REDACTED,en,3315,"Recently stayed the night as a quick getaway in the city. Overall, for the reputation this hotel has, I was disappointed. The grounds are dated and the rooms are dated as well. The shining star of the grounds, in my opinion, is the onsite garden, definitely walk through if you stay. 

We visited the spa which was OK, relaxing at a minimum but not the greatest I've been to. We had booked the luxury spa suite for our treatment and weren't even allowed to use the bronze tub which they so heavily advertise - major let down! Also, hated that the nicest restaurant and lounge not only allowed smoking, but left a lingering smell throughout the entire venue. I understand that when in Tokyo, you'll encounter a lot of indoor smoking, but at least mitigate it at a luxury property. 

Had we not utilized a reward night for the stay, I'd be extremely in lieu of just disappointed. Overall, I recommend checking in to the Intercon for a similar, less expensive experience OR spend a little more and visit The Conrad and be blown away.",3,2017/07/18
2,REDACTED,en,3316,"I would like to write this review to thank the Westin Tokyo hotel for their high quality of service on every level and would like also to share a little story that we have experienced during our stay in Japan few days ago (July 2017).

We've visited few cities in Japan during our vacation (Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto) and in our way to The Westin in Tokyo coming from The Westin Miyako Kyoto, we realized that we have lost a mobile phone and only discover about the situation once we have checked in to the Westin Tokyo. By notifying the front desk, they suggested us to speak to their concierge for further assistance, so, we then met this wonderful and very patient and professional young lady named ETSUKO NAKAGAWA who took the time to collect all the information and starts the investigation from the Westin Kyoto, the Shinkansen train, the metro stations we have used. She spent few hour on the phone trying to locate the phone and Yes, she was able to find it at the Shinkansen Lost & found Tokyo station. 

So she requested the case number from the Lost & Found office so we can go and pick it up easily by proving identification. And ultimately, we found the phone in very good hand as she said.

So I take this opportunity to thank ESTUKO for her great service and also the hotel for the wonderful hotel of which they should be proud. We will definitely go back !

Our room was very clean and spacious. There are even kimonos for you to wear!",5,2017/07/16

2,REDACTED,en,3319,"The room was spacious and the hotel was very nice and clean. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The bathroom was big and spacious as well. The view was incredible. The location was GREAT! We were right near a few restaurants and Ebisu which had a lot of neat restaurants. It was close to a train station as well. The beds weren't that soft, but it wasn't an issue. The rooms were very quiet. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017/07/11
2,REDACTED,en,3320,"This hotel is a few subway stops from Shebuya (crossing). It is tucked in an area that feels residential which was why I picked it.

The room was clean but a bit too dark. Nothing memorable to mention but the location was great. I could find many ramen noodle shops, boutique sushi places within a few blocks of the hotel.

The walk from the subway station was pleasant and I definitely felt safe to explore the neighborhood.

Take the bus the hotel if you got a chance, way cheaper than what I paid for the taxi.",4,2017/07/10
2,REDACTED,en,3321,"We stayed there for our family vacation. We had a two bedded room and the room is spacious - hugh bathroom with standing showers and a separate bath tub. All Staffs are friendly and provided great service. 

The hotel is about 10 minutes walk to or from the JR station but it's all covered with moving walkway for both directions (escalator). Very convenient. Ebisu station is the closer station but Meguro is not that far neither; it just doesn't have the covered walkway. The Metro station is just addition 3 mins walk from the JR exit. Super easy! 

The only two things that need improvement: I Wish they have real Double beds like America. It sleeps two but it's super tight. Another thing was smoking on the guests floors. I wish they separate the floors with smoking and non-somoking. We are non-smoker but the smoke was so strong in the hallway. You have to close your guest room door quickly or else your room will smell like smoke too. 

I'll definitely stay there again!",5,2017/07/07
2,REDACTED,en,3322,"We stayed at the hotel for five nights. The lobby is beautiful. The service is excellent.
As SPG members we had a deluxe room then were moved to a suite after the first night. The suite was huge! Amazing views. Access to the club lounge on the 17th floor is a plus. We ate breakfast there every morning and from 5:30-7:30 complimentary cocktails and appetizers are offered. 
The staff is excellent, especially the girls working in the club lounge and also the young man at the front desk by the entrance.
Location of the hotel in Ebisu is also great. It is an upscale, quiet area and nice to be away from the busy more popular areas. The train station is an easy 10 minute walk outside or underground. Many nice restaurants and shopping across the street from hotel.
Easy access from Narita airport on the limousine bus which takes 1 hr 45 mins.

2,REDACTED,en,3326,Deciding on a hotel in greater Tokyo- one has plenty of choices. Was tempted to try a different hotel but a wonderful first time two years ago swayed my decision to try Westin again. And with zero regrets. Family and I had a wonderful time. Great service from the moment we arrived - Mohammed from Indonesia at Concierge was Super friendly and helpful! Room nice and clean and well appointed. We tried the buffet breakfast one morning and that was also v good and high quality. Locale is fine and a nice walk to Ebisu. Some might say a bit of a walk but it's a nice one through the Ebisu Glasshouse and gardens.,5,2017/06/27

Enjoyed the morning quietness while having breakfast.",4,2017/06/25
2,REDACTED,en,3328,"For this visit, we chose to stay in a generally quiet side of the city. Usually our choice is Shinjuku but Ebisu did not disappoint. It's a bit of a walk to the actual train track from the hotel but there are walkalators if you're feeling lazy. The Ebisu stop is very close to popular destinations like Shibuya and Harajuku. We really loved the relaxed atmosphere around the hotel. We enjoyed the Japanese breakfast over the Western breakfast. Rooms could use updating. Staff are okay but not as friendly and as efficient as the other hotels we've stayed in.",4,2017/06/21
2,REDACTED,en,3329,"Stayed at Westin Tokyo for business in May, 2017. It's about 10 minutes walk to JR/subway Ebisu station. There are many shops/restaurants in the area. Taxis are always waiting in front. Very convenient. 

Hotel is either fairy new or nicely kept/renovated. Its garden in the backyard is small but nice. The hotel has a Club Lounge and the staff was very helpful. You can have breakfast/evening drinks at three locations -- Club Lounge, 22nd floor, and 1st floor. Great to have choices and it's never crowded. 

Gym was rather small and basic, but it served the purpose. The room was modern and spacious, and it came with nice amenities (espresso machine, kettle, refrigerator, bath robe, shampoo, shaving kit, etc.). 

The only negative was no shuttle bus service to/from Haneda airport. No problem if you use Narita airport.",5,2017/06/18
2,REDACTED,en,3330,"Good hotel in Tokyo for a business stay. Easy to reach and well located.
Friendly staff and good meeting facilities.
Only remark is the very long waiting line in the morning for breakfast, i.e., you needed to plan ahead and get up earlier in case you want breakfast.",4,2017/06/10
2,REDACTED,en,3331,"The staff are friendly and knowledgeable about the area. I arrived late at night and they were still able to help me find a place to eat. You must try the low cost shoes and running gear the SPG hotels are now supplying, I did this here in Tokyo and walked almost 10 miles per day! 
The rooms are wonderful with lots of old style. 
My only regret is that I left Tokyo for a few days and when I came back the hotel was booked. I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Would recommend it for the business traveler, while it is out of the way, the metro is close and easy to get to any point.",5,2017/06/08
2,REDACTED,en,3332,"We stayed 3 nights at The Westin Tokyo, and overall it was a great experience. We were able to use the club on the 17 th floor which was nice for breakfast and snacks before dinner. Besides the club it also had some other great amenities like a gym which was perfect for working off the many delicious treats in Tokyo. The hotel room was nice and had a good amount of space considering we had 3 people in one room, the staff was also quite helpful in getting us a third bed. The staff was also very attentive, and were always very helpful when we were leaving for the day. Overall it was a very enjoyable stay!",4,2017/06/07

Staff are all very friendly and helpful. Room was a nice size and had a small fridge, desk, sofa and chair. Very nice hotel, will stay here again and would recommend to anyone.

Took the airport shuttle from Narita airport to the hotel. It took over 2 hours because of multiple stops before the Westin and some traffic.",5,2017/06/05

2,REDACTED,en,3337,"I spent the last 3 nights of my 21 day trip in Japan at The Westin and it was great. The rooms are quite large, service was excellent and if you have time make sure to check out the spa.

2,REDACTED,en,3338,"This used to be one of our favourite hotels in Tokyo. I like the location and service is usually good. 

I'm a platinum member with SPG and used my suite upgrade for a recent stay. We were give a suite opposite the service room, so the carts' banging noise goes on the whole day. As my husband wasn't feeling well those two nights we were there, we had to stay in a lot of the time and it wasn't restful at all. 

It's not the housekeeping staff's fault. They were doing their jobs. But my question to the manager is: why bother to give an upgrade when your guest don't enjoy the stay? I could have saved my suite award nights for stays at other hotels! And you shouldn't treat your loyal guests that way.",3,2017/05/20
2,REDACTED,en,3339,"We stayed one night in a standard room which appeared to be recently modernised and two days later stayed for 2 nights in an executive access room. The standard of accommodation and service is excellent. Free wifi as an SPG member. The room was very quiet, no irritating aircon noise! It's a short walk to Ebisu station and there's a great shopping centre with restaurants and a food hall next door. The Executive lounge was not a winner and one breakfast in the main dining room was enough. An excellent well located hotel.",5,2017/05/17
2,REDACTED,en,3340,"Beautiful, quiet hotel conveniently located near the Meguro metro/JR train station that's only a few stops away from Shibuya and Shinjuku (think Harajuku girls; sensory overload style areas). Staff was amazing and accommodating. There is a mall nearby and several, small eateries to chose from if one doesn't feel like venturing into the wilds of Tokyo.",5,2017/05/16
2,REDACTED,en,3341,"My wife and I recently had a great 2 night stay at the Westin. The hotel is right across the Ebisu Garden Place, and a quick 5- 10 minute walk from Ebisu station via the skywalk. Hotel was in great condition with spacious rooms for Tokyo and good service from the staff (concierge helped us book dinner reservations at well ranked sushi-bar in Roppongi). We had the breakfast buffet at the hotel and it was tasty with a mix of western and Japanese dishes at a reasonable 3000 Yen.

Ebisu Garden Place, which is right in front of the hotel, offers convenient access to shopping and a suite of restaurants. It's a very nice mall which is well designed and seemingly well liked by locals. It has a Mitsukoshi department store, Starbucks, a Joel Robuchon restaurant (we loved the bakery on the basement floor!), and local markets on weekends.

The only disappointment we experienced was the Compass Rose bar on the top floor, which allowed smoking. We liked the great views from the bar and the drinks were good, but as non-smokers we really couldn't sit for more than 30 minutes. I felt this didn't fit Westin's image as a health conscious hotel and hope this gets amended soon.

Overall we feel this was one of the best hotels we've stayed in Tokyo (I've been to 
Tokyo nearly 10 times) and look forward to coming here again.",4,2017/05/13
2,REDACTED,en,3342,"We had a family vacation trip to Japan (9 days) and as part of that we spent 2 nights in Tokyo at the Westin. As soon as we got there we were all impressed with the lobby. It's an impressive array of marble and beautiful art work. The rooms are also well appointed and the bathrooms are very nice. We were very tired from our long flight from the US and it was very easy to sleep in the room as it was nice and quiet. I'm a light sleeper and having a quiet room is a big deal for me!
We ate breakfast one morning at the buffet restaurant and it was great. The night we arrived (from the US) we were tired and had dinner at the buffet restaurant and it wasn't great. That's the only ding we have but since we were jet lagged it's not fair to be overly harsh.",5,2017/05/12
2,REDACTED,en,3343,Great location amazing hotel within walking distance of the Metro and if you are up to it a walk to the Shibuya and Harajuku areas Good food nearby and plenty of places to stop and grab a cold beer. We will be back!!,5,2017/05/06
2,REDACTED,en,3344,"I always try and stay in SPG hotels as I am SPG Platinum but I don't think I would be rushing back to the Westin. I had great expectations when entering the grand lobby but then found the surprisingly small reception in a far corner and a queue to check in. My first disappointment was that somehow, despite my booking having been made a week or so in advance, I was somehow placed in a room with two single beds for my two nights. They couldn't move me to any other rooms, and didn't off a solution for the second night. For SPG Platinum, that is pretty disappointing. Room itself was ok and decent size for Tokyo but a bit old. People should also note the location is not central and there isn't that much nearby.

Pros:
- grand hotel with some character
- decent size rooms for Tokyo standards
- food was decent quality in the hotel, though not that many choices nearby
- the bar near the top of the building was quite nice

Cons:
- location is average, its not that central for Tokyo but there is a subway nearby
- old rooms that need some renovating
- Executive Lounge was very crowded and always seemed to be running out of food. Didn't have much choice, though at least for breakfast you could have eaten at the main restaurant",3,2017/05/03
2,REDACTED,en,3345,"We were there for 5 days (4 nights). The hotel is really beautiful and clean. The room was comfortable and spacious for a family of 4. The beds are a little smaller for anyone who's used to the US full/queen size bed. The amenities were great. We didn't really need to pack our toiletries (tooth brush, razors ect). The view from the bedroom on 19th floor was amazing we ended up not visiting Tokyo Tower.
There were good dining inside the hotel. SPG members can lounge and dine at there 17th floor lounge. The Buffet downstairs was great. We had breakfast there and it had fresh juices, smoothies as well as a wide variety of western and Japanese food.
The staff was very courteous and friendly. The location was convenient. It was just a block from the Ebisu station (on Yamanote line). Food and some shopping available close by as well.",5,2017/04/26
2,REDACTED,en,3346,This hotel is in desperate need of a design update. My bathroom featured mauve tiles and the carpet and furnishings are in worn condition and dated style. I choose this hotel to use my SPG points while passing through Tokyo (there are only 4 SPG hotels in the Tokyo area) and am disappointed with my decision. The location is also in a quiet neighborhood that is about a 10 minute walk to the metro (and then another 20 minute ride to get to any of the major attractions). I suspect this is a property heavily used for conventions (at least 2 were underway when I arrived) where the hotel experience is less important than the conference negotiated rates and ballroom spaces.,3,2017/04/24
2,REDACTED,en,3347,"Rented two rooms for my 5 day family stay in Tokyo. Hotel front desk staff were professional.

The rooms were the most spacious of our Japan visit. They were very nice and well maintained. The cleaning staff were very friendly.

The hotel is easy to get to, located under a ten minute walk from Ebisu Station. Being located here is ideal for anyone wanting to hop on a train to visit popular sights (like Shinjuku or Sibuya crossing, etc) or shopping in Tokyo. Cherry blossoms at Meguro, just one stop from Ebisu, are currently in full bloom. 

Starbucks, a nice pizza restaurant and department store shopping is nearby.

The hotel restaurant is a bit pricey but we enjoyed having dinner there one of the evenings.

Overall our stay at the Westin was the best of our stays in Japan.

2,REDACTED,en,3348,"The Westin Tokyo has been one of my go-to hotels in Tokyo for many years. The past few visits, however, have made me possibly seek alternatives.

The property (including the rooms) are still in pristine condition, but I've witnessed a noticeable drop in service - both by the people at the front desk as well as (and especially) in Terrace, the main restaurant there.

The warm and friendly smiles, as well as the attentive and snappy service, have been replaced by indifferent staff. I just don't see the warm.... they're going through the motions, and it really shows in their demeanor and expressions. At breakfast, I rarely ever see smiles anymore, resulting in a rather ""cold"" atmosphere. This is especially appalling given Japan's strong service-oriented culture. While it may not the most important thing in the world, at this rate the hotel management should replace all employees with robots, since that's what it appears they've become... cold and impersonal.",2,2017/04/23
2,REDACTED,en,3349,"Very nice hotel; location was not ideal compared to other similar properties in Tokyo; located across the street from a Yebisu beer museum and brewery and shopping mall but mall closes early; area is not close to other crowded Tokyo districts with lively nightly atmosphere; service was good; Airport Limousine service to Narita Airport was available but schedule was not as convenient as other major hotels in Tokyo; property was high-end; no convenient store on site, had to walk a ways away; room was very nice and spacious for Japan standards; bed was comfortable; great welcome service; bathroom was modern with all amenities; pricy but expected for Tokyo; overall great property",4,2017/04/23
2,REDACTED,en,3350,"I stayed here with my husband, young son and teenage nephew over the Easter break on our big Japan tour. We were given two adjoining rooms which were huge by Japan standards and very comfortably furnished. Pretty luxurious compared to our Kyoto hotel in fact. The main bedroom had a king bed and sofa seating area as well as a large desk. The bathroom was also large and with all mod cons. The adjoining room had two large twin beds, could easily have accomodated more than 2 kids. The Westin is located by Ebisu station on the JR line so very convenient for Shinjuku, Shibuya and really everywhere else. It sits on a large covered square with coffee shops, restaurants, pizzeria and a large upscale department store. Don't be put off by reviews saying its a long trek from the station. It takes about 7 mins as there is a covered moving walkway for most of the way. Its a lovely place to stay, even though the weather was not very pleasant in April and very convenient for getting around. We had dinner in the restaurant one evening which was fine but skipped breakfast as its expensive (like everything in Japan) but there are also queues for breakfast which I cannot stand. However, Ebisu station has lots of bakeries, food and restaurants (including an awesome Dean and Deluca) so there's lots of choices. There's also a department store, bookshop and Starbucks upstairs. I'd definitely recommend the Westin as a place to stay in Tokyo. It is a bit out of the main nightlife areas but has its own charms.",5,2017/04/21

2,REDACTED,en,3352,"After reading other reviews on Trip Advisor, I was surprised at how much I liked this hotel. I chose to stay here because I could get some of the nights we needed for SPG points, but I would certainly stay again on my own dime if I were to return to Tokyo. The location was great as a base for seeing the city because of the close proximity to the Ebisu station, which has both subway and local rail connections. This hotel is sumptuously decorated, but it doesn't feel overdone. Our room (an upgrade) was large by Tokyo standards and had plenty of room for all three of us. The bath was large, with a tub and separate shower. The beds, even my son's rollaway, were comfortable. I only ate at two of the hotel's many restaurants, but both were quite good. The Terrace has a great breakfast buffet (I'm not normally a fan of these), which includes Western and Japanese offerings. The same restaurant also has an impressive dinner buffet, though the price is a bit steep. The Chinese restaurant on the second floor is first rate in quality of the food and service, thought it is also quite expensive and the portions are small by the standards of even upscale American Chinese restaurants. One thing the Westin lacks is an informal restaurant where one can grab a quick bite. However, one can get burgers and some other lighter items from room service, which we did on several occasions. It was always prompt and the food arrived warm. The service in the hotel was almost uniformly excellent. The concierge helped us with restaurant reservations in advance of our arrival. Unfortunately, the recommended sushi restaurant was a disappointment. They were unable to get us reservations a number of places we mentioned, and we wish they had just told us we hadn't requested early enough rather than substitute an inferior alternative.",5,2017/04/21
2,REDACTED,en,3353,"Located in a slightly less harried part of Tokyo, yet still central enough to get to Ginza, Shinjuku and the rest easily on the JR or metro lines. It took almost an hour to come in from Haneda by taxi on a Friday morning, but almost unbelieveably less than 30 minutes in a taxi to get to Haneda on Monday afternoon. 

Service was warm and efficient and checking in and out was a breeze. Concierge kindly helped with restaurant and car-hire reservations prior to our arrival. 

The room was very well maintained and fitted with classic decor, very slightly dated, but really not something I would complain about given the very high level of cleaning and maintenance. My deluxe room was very spacious with a dressing table and mirror so I didn't have to crowd the work desk with my cosmetics. The bathroom had a separate shower and bathtub which really is the way to go. 

My reservation rate came with breakfast, which was alright. My only real complaint is that on Saturday morning they were clearly operating on a full house because there was a snaking queue at the breakfast restaurant. After queueing for 10 minutes and not getting anywhere, we decided to forgo breakfast at the hotel. I thought they could have managed this better by taking steps for alternative arrangements especially for guests who had breakfast packages with their rooms. 

Otherwise, everything was just perfect.",4,2017/04/20
2,REDACTED,en,3354,"Rooms were roomy and comfortable. Definitely slept better here than in our hotel in Kyoto. Had breakfast here everyday when we stayed. The breakfast had a lot of options including dim sum, udon, and western foods. On Sundays there's also the traditional style Japanese breakfast that was a neat experience. 

Hotel staff was very nice and relatively helpful as well. I would stay here again.",4,2017/04/20

The Westin i linked by a long subway and bridge to the station so you are protected against the weather, about a 10 minute walk and just under 1KM. The Airport Limousine goes door to door for Yen 31,000 and the train is feasible if you are carrying hand luggage. We had an executive room which was spacious and allowed access to the business lounge for breakfast, teas and coffee all day and cocktails from 17.30- 19.30. we were allowed 3 areas for breakfast, the lounge, cage or Victors. Breakfast was ample but the cocktails in the evening was with some snacks but they were the same everyday! The Compass Rose at night with its views is excellent for a nightcap with a piano player. Great value, excellent service we would return.",5,2017/04/17

Shower was rain shower with nice amenities. Club lounge was large with great views of the city. There is a shopping mall across the street even with a banana republic!

2,REDACTED,en,3360,"Three Times And Still Love It!

I have stayed at many hotels in Tokyo and this is still my favorite. Here is my Top 5 List of why I will stay at the Westin Tokyo again.

1. Hotel/Rooms- The hotel does not look like a traditional Japanese hotel which is usually more minimalistic. The Westin Tokyo looks like a luxurious European hotel with a beautiful grand staircase and lots of rich wood and beautiful floor tile. The rooms are very large by Tokyo standards and luxuriously appointed like the hotel. 

2. Service- I’ve always had great service at this hotel. I wanted a view of the Tokyo Tower on the Club Floor and it wasn’t available when I checked in. The front office manager, Takeshi, was able to get one of the best rooms on the Club floor the next day. It was a little bit of a pain packing and moving but it was worth it. The concierge service is also very good. I’ve stayed at other Tokyo Japanese owned hotels where the concierges don’t speak much English. This is a big plus at the Westin Tokyo.

3. Breakfast at the Terrace and Club Floor Lounge- As a Platinum Starwood member, I was able to have breakfast at the Terrace restaurant buffet. This is a very extensive buffet with an omelet bar, freshly squeezed juices, smoked salmon, daily fish, dim sum, noodle bar, salad bar, fresh fruits, miso soup, pancakes, waffles, and a ton of desserts. The Club floor also has breakfast but the Terrace is far better. The Club Floor Lounge also has Happy Hour every night from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm which includes Yebisu beer, wines, and other alcohol. In addition, there was soup, edamame, cheese and crackers, pasta, and desserts. Also the lounge has an outstanding view of the city including the Tokyo Tower .

4 Location- Ebisu is a quieter and more residential area of Tokyo but there is lots of action near the Ebisu train station. Some of my favorite restaurants are close to the Ebisu train station and don’t forget to try the Yokocho (across the street from the McDonalds) which is an indoor alley with over 20 Japanese restaurants. I do admit that the 10 to 15 minute walk to the train station even with the moving walkway does get tiresome every day but every hotel has a tradeoff.

5. Price- The Westin Tokyo is priced very competitively and is usually way cheaper than other 5- Star Tokyo hotels.",5,2017/04/14
2,REDACTED,en,3361,"Rarely are my views so far off the popular wisdom. As an SPG gold member, I know what service should look like. I also know what else is on offer in Tokyo as I visit every quarter. 

Know this:
Service sucks. Example: I arrived at 10PM and discovered all their restaurants were closed. I then asked if I could have room service (which was still available) deliver to the bar and was told repeatedly NO. Not possible. The client is always wrong at this hotel!

Tacky & tired. 
This is a hideous building inside and out. Think 1970s Vegas and you'll get the picture. Godzilla is the only one who should stay here - and knock it down. 

Terrible location
Business people should avoid as it is near nothing. Tourists as well since it is near nothing. 

Suggested alternatives 
Pretty much anywhere! The Shangri-La is amazing and has exceptional service. Better location even the Conrad blows this place away. Avoid this Westin at all costs!",1,2017/04/13
2,REDACTED,en,3362,"Booked a club deluxe room for sakura. Service was fantastic from the time we arrived the bell desk whisked our luggage away, check-in was fast and efficient, we were sent to the club lounge for drinks, then retired for the night. The buffet breakfast was included and was catered to a more Western crowd but was delicious yet busy due to being in the lobby. I'd recommend this hotel due to its proximity to Harajuku and Shibuya.",5,2017/04/10
2,REDACTED,en,3363,"Location was great for touring Tokyo. Quiet neighborhood with variety of restaurants within walking distance. Excellent breakfast buffet. Staff were very helpful. If you are lucky you might even see Mt Fuji from the upper floors but she's ""shy and moody"" and only peaks out periodically.",4,2017/04/10
2,REDACTED,en,3364,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Westin Tokyo. The hotel was located in a lovely area and public transportation was easily accessible. The hotel is beautiful and stately with lots of old school charm. All employees were very kind and very accommodating. Our suite was quite large (especially given how space is a premium in Japan), lovely and well kept. We would definitely come back and stay again :) We also had their lovely Japanese breakfast and would recommend for anyone to give it a try!",4,2017/04/10
2,REDACTED,en,3365,"I've been to Tokyo many time before but first time to this property, as the Sakura season attracted many visitors over the weekend, I wasn't able to book an additional night so I tried to reach out in advance to the team to ask for recommendations nearby. However, the first response was slow and thereafter I haven't heard back from them at all. 
Until check in my view and expectation of the trip changed 369 degrees. I was so lucky to met the sweetest and loveliest Aye Mon at the front desk, she had the warmest smile and bubbliest personality. As it was pouring rain in Tokyo and we came dropping wet from the famous Tsujiki fish market, we were looking to just store our luggage first and borrow some umbrellas to visit nearby parks until the standard check in time. Mon was so hospitable and had the most understanding empathy to be so kind as to extend the gesture to help us find a room to go in and change from our wet clothes. We didn't even have to ask, but the effort of her trying to find us a sanctuary was all it counted, this is the kind of hospitality I am always WOW-ed by.
Most hotels have problems of hot water running out by the end of a shower, but this one's a strong and steady one. I was able to enjoy a long and reviving hot bath after a long day of walking and exploring the city.
The view from the room is also spectacular, thank goodness the sky cleared up by the time we headed back to our room after dinner at Shibuya, and was able to see the gobsmacking view of the beautiful Tokyo Tower. Thank you Mon!
If you want to get lost in a city, Tokyo is the one to let your wildest adventure buds run free. Transpiration is so convenient and all the food are so yummy, just bear in mind lots of walking takes place! And if you are at Westin Tokyo, do remember to stop by front desk to visit my favourite - Mon! Maps, insider tips, additional information that she didn't have to but wanted to provide just to help me... she's got it all! Thank you for making my trip so much better :)",5,2017/04/09
2,REDACTED,en,3366,"Great service! Lovely, upscale hotel in a good location. I'd recommend getting the buffet breakfast, which is included in some of the rates. From standard American breakfast, to European and even Japan sushi & fresh fish. Check out the view from the Resturant/bar on the top floor!",5,2017/04/08
2,REDACTED,en,3367,"I like several of the SPG properties around Japan and wanted to try the Westin in Tokyo to see how it measured up (I had five rooms booked across the weekend starting different days). The rooms are nice and comfortable, but the service lets the hotel down. Examples:

Check-in was a drama. Not enough people on desk and waits of 30 minutes.
Getting a message to another room was not possible - they were unable to tell me the room numbers under the booking after check-in (really?).
Wifi for 1500yen is out of step.
Charging the accmmodation tax (Y200) extra on pre-paid rooms. Only a few hotels in Japan do this and this is one of them - it is tacky (especially given the price)
And location - while the area is nice, after the first day it was a pain.",2,2017/04/05
2,REDACTED,en,3368,"This is really, a five star hotel which deserves five stars. Location not the best but quiet and within a relatively mid-range district. Aircon is strong, room amenities are sufficient (and generously replaced), mineral water complimentary and regularly replaced, nice green tea selections, wifi is fast and reliable, many dining options inside hotel and nearby... it faces an upscale mall. Buffet breakfast downstairs was of a good spread, with efficient staff. 

It deserves but doesn't receive five stars for one reason alone - I didn't get my king bed. Which is still fine, provided the two queen beds in my room are truly queen. Unfortunately, even the ""queen"" is more of a ""super-single"". The hotel probably won't do anything about that (I can understand), but I am not happy to sleep on a super single when it should have been king or at least a real queen.",4,2017/04/03
2,REDACTED,en,3369,"This Westin is much better than for example Westin Kyoto. The decor and service are of try luxury levels. We had two interconnected rooms and the room layouts were different and ideal for a family of four. 
The Spa centre is very high quality and there are separate facilities for men and women.

2,REDACTED,en,3370,"We just returned from our three night stay at Westin Tokyo. It is located in a quiet neighbourhood and walking distance from subway and shopping. Staff was excellent, rooms were nice, and service was great.",4,2017/04/03
2,REDACTED,en,3371,"Great hotel, super convenient location (about a 5 minute walk through a lovely plaza to the Ebisu line), club level includes a delicious buffet and happy hour, friendly service, spacious room with a view of the city.",5,2017/04/02
2,REDACTED,en,3372,"You can reach this hotel easily on the JR Yamanota Line. Once you get off at the Ebisu stop you'll follow the signs to Ebisu or Yebisu Garden Skywalk. Once the skywalk ends you can exit to street level and walk south through the mall area to the hotel or walk under the mall if it's raining by taking the stairs just to the left of the exit. Both ways have signs directing you to the Westin. Tokyo's Limousin Bus line so convenient for travelers also picks up and drops off at the Westin. 

The area is lovely and the mall is great for high end shopping. It is not however indicative of Japanese culture. It felt like being in a very nice area of the US. The hotel is huge with a large western style lobby and rooms. You still get a shower toilet and a beautiful garden is on the grounds. 

The toilet in our room was so load every time you sat on it- lasting for about 2 minutes after getting up- that I thought it was broken. They fixed it while we were out, but it still seemed crazy load after that. This is not indicative of any of the other shower toilets we've experienced and might have been particular to that toilet, but it was annoying enough for me to lower the hotel's score. There were also banging sounds and you could easily hear the family in the adjoining room (we had a corner room with a lovely view of Tokyo Tower). I am very noise sensitive- so if you aren't then this is a great US style hotel and area for you.",4,2017/03/30
2,REDACTED,en,3373,"Had the opportunity to visit Tokyo for work and added a few days to travel. The Westin was a wonderful hotel to stay from the minute I walked in the door. A majority of the staff knew English. Much of the staffed remembered us and would ask how our visit was and would make recommendations and great local places to eat and visit. Everyone was extremely helpful.

Their menu was a good mixture of local food and international food. The breakfast buffet was absolutely wonderful and they seem to have something for everyone.

My view was amazing(city view) with a beautiful sunrise. I would highly recommend the city view if you have a choice.

The beds were comfortable but the pillows were very thin. I had to use three of them. 

I could not find a convenient store in the hotel but within walking distance there were many shops.",4,2017/03/28
2,REDACTED,en,3374,"Great hotel, large rooms especially for Tokyo. Great location (quiet) and Ebisu station is fantastic for food and shopping, very accessible to all tourist activities. Beer museum across the road is handy also.",5,2017/03/27
2,REDACTED,en,3375,"Had a great stay in March at this fabulous hotel. Check in at the front desk was quick and efficient.Bellboys noticed us struggling with our luggage as we were nearing the hotel and rushed to help.

Room is huge with a couch as well as a work desk. Overall fantastic stay with 24hrs convenience store within 5 mins walking distance. Train station is about 10 mins walk away.

Just a tip though, when taking the Hibiya line, do get out and go up the escalator to the ATRE shopping center especially if you have heavy luggage's. There are travelators and there are no slopes. Else the walkway up the slope is not fun with uneven terrain. it will seem like forever before you reach the hotel. That's what happened to us on the 1st day.",5,2017/03/26
2,REDACTED,en,3376,Stayed here with my wife and three children of couple of times in February and thoroughly reccommend the place. Really great staff... and I mean that in the context of Tokyo where service is good pretty much everywhere. The buffet breakfast is really worth trying. The hotel fitout and style itself is getting a little old but I really like the way it feels and honestly I hope that it stays like this for many years to come. Great little bar tucked at the back of the lobby also. These guys know what they're doing. They even had little robes for the kids. Views are great out across the city also. Easy run into Shibuya from here.,5,2017/03/24
2,REDACTED,en,3377,"We stayed here for 1 week in March.
This hotel is located 1 train stop away from Shibuya and about a 10 minute walk from the Ebisu station (which can get you anywhere you want to go). Near the hotel there are many restaurants and convenient stores. The Yebisu Garden shopping complex is just across the street and you can find a Starbucks there.

Hotel staff is very friendly and polite, everyone we encountered spoke english very well. 

The buffet breakfast was AMAZING. 
Fresh bottles of water were delivered every day.

Overall- very pleasant stay here. Would consider staying here again if I visit Tokyo.",5,2017/03/24
2,REDACTED,en,3378,"Spent 4 nights at the Westin. If you are using SPG points, this hotel is a good deal for what you get. The rooms are large and clean, traditionally styled, quiet, and have their own Nespresso machine!!! In a city where coffee chops don't open until 8 or 9, it was a luxury to have an espresso early in the morning. Very helpful staff.

Nice gym and it's easy to run along a river very close to the hotel. We only ate once in the hotel and felt is was too expensive for what it was. But there are many restaurants within a 10 minute walk. 

The hotel isn't particularly close to the major sites of Tokyo, but the Ebisu station is a 10-15 minute walk away and it made travel easy. Just know that walk back and forth from the station gets a bit tiring after a few days of walking miles around Tokyo to see the incredible city. If I were to it over again, I would stay somewhere where more sites are within walking distance or were closer to a train station.",4,2017/03/23
2,REDACTED,en,3379,"I stayed at the Westin Tokyo for just one night.

The staff are all helpful and friendly, and speak good English too.

The rooms and nicely appointed and mine had a great view over the city.

The traffic around Tokyo can be really heavy so recommend to allow 45 mins if traveling from Haneda, and at least an hour for Narita. 

Great city and thoroughly recommend this hotel.",5,2017/03/21
2,REDACTED,en,3380,Really enjoyed this hotel. The staff were great and very friendly. Breakfast was one of the international offerings I have yet had and I eat in a lot of hotels. The location is perfect as it is in the middle of two train stations so getting around town is very easy. There is a mall under it that is fun to get lost in.,5,2017/03/15
2,REDACTED,en,3381,"The hotel is in downtown Tokyo, next to a big shopping mall. So plenty of restaurants within walking distance. There is airport shuttle to NRT as well which is very convenient and economic. The room is clean and spacious. The view is great with Tokyo's sleepless neon lights. Bed is comfortable and very quiet in the night. The lounge is not very impressive unfortunately, but the breakfast buffet is quite good. Price is reasonable for that quality. They also have some garden at the back looks very pretty.",4,2017/03/15

2,REDACTED,en,3385,"Having travelled over 15 hours to get to Tokyo, The Westin Tokyo was a welcome respite for these weary travelers. It's got a great location being a short walk to the subway or the JR train. The room itself is luxurious with views of Mt. Fuji. The appointments are everything you'd expect from Westin ensuring we got a good night's rest. The hotel restaurant was an excellent thing to have after a busy day of touring and all this couple wanted was something to eat before passing out. There was also a Starbucks across the street which was helpful for grabbing a pastry and going. I've already recommended this hotel to anyone that will listen and plan to use it again on my next stay!! Thank you for being a great part of my trip!",5,2017/03/08
2,REDACTED,en,3386,"The staff, eg reception, bell service is superbly friendly and welcoming.

The rooms are large, no surprises and very clean; certainly much in better condition than similar hotels in US (eg bathroom looks like new, without the traditional mould stains etc).

Pick a room on high floor with city view to enjoy sunrise or -set on downtown Tokyo with its red and white tower.

Great business hotel!",5,2017/03/08
2,REDACTED,en,3387,"Like to stay in hotels that are convenient but not too crowd with people. Westin Tokyo seems to be one of them. Quite quiet for me which is what I like. Room temperature can be adjusted which is very important especially when it is cold, places in Japan usually turns the heat on which could be stuffy, but rooms here can have temperature control. Restaurants choices within walking distance. If you pick upper class, of course Joel Robuchon, but within 2 minutes walk, the compound nearby have restaurants of different choices. Walking distance to JR station too. Taxis also available outside the hotel. Good place for business visitors like me. And for leisure visitors, there is one department store Mitsuikoshi across the street seems less place for shopping but..... Shibuya and Shinjuku are reachable via JR 1 or 2 stations. Overall is good for business visit.",4,2017/02/28
2,REDACTED,en,3388,"This hotel was higher quality than the price I paid. Rooms are nice and the Cityview ones are good size, there's a nice garden outside the lobby and a decent gym. 
The hotel Street is pretty quiet, especially at night but a short stroll brings you to the rail line and plenty of choices of things to do. 
Ebisu brewery museum was worthwhile and just across the street from the hotel. It's less than an hour, and the tour doesn't have an English option so better if you were with a Japanese friend. But you get to sample some beer and hear about the early days of Japanese beer making.

2,REDACTED,en,3389,"The Westin was a relaxing and perfect home-base for my stay in Tokyo. The location worked for me, as I found it was in decent proximity to the train, or easy to get to places via taxi. I was hesitant to book here, reading reviews about the accommodations being outdated. However, I didn't find that to be the case. Don't mistake outdated for their decor style which is more classic elegance, rather than modern. I ate at Yebisu and Mai and had some of the best steak and sushi I've every tasted. The executive club staff were very helpful and welcoming. By the end of my stay it felt like home and was sad to leave.",5,2017/02/21
2,REDACTED,en,3390,"I have stayed at many hotels in Tokyo over the past few years, this is my favorite place. Excellent hotel, great service, very friendly staff. A little more expensive than the Sheraton nearby in Miyako ( to be expected) but we'll worth the price difference.",5,2017/02/17
2,REDACTED,en,3391,"I've stayed in many hotels around the world and this ranks as my favorite. Not only do they have all the luxuries of a top notch hotel, but the staff is extremely helpful, the facility is classy, and they've done a great job of keeping it up and making it inviting. I ended the night in the loung at the top of the hotel and was stunned with the night views of the city and Tokyo Tower. This hotel is a must stop!",5,2017/02/16
2,REDACTED,en,3392,The Westin is a nice hotel although the decoration is a bit dated. The staff is very helpful. It is located across from the Yebisu palace so you can get coffee and food across the street. There is also the very nice photography museum there. The subway station is a bit far.,4,2017/02/12
2,REDACTED,en,3393,"We used to live nearby, my wife wanted to stay in this hotel during our recent trip - part of going down memory lane. Although we checked in at 4:20PM we needed to wait close to 20 minutes to get our room. However, it was worthwhile as we got a nice room on the 21st floor, the highest for guest rooms in this hotel. The extra bed and towels for our daughter were all nicely prepared as well. Beds at any Westin are always awesome!
The rooms show their age, they are still in very good condition but especially the bathrooms look very dated. WIFI was very good across the hotel. Service was good. We preferred breakfast in the club lounge and ate there on 4 out of 5 mornings. The Terrace restaurant has a larger selection but it felt too crowded and understaffed.
Staff at the club lounge were always friendly and remembered our personal preferences.
The location of the Westin is nice as it is at the edge of a residential area. The Ebisu train station can be reached within a 8 to 10 minutes leisurely walk - all covered if you wish.
In summary, not the newest property anymore but a gem in this part of Tokyo. Ideal for both business travelers and tourists who don't mind being a little bit away from Roppongi, Shinjuku or Ginza.",4,2017/02/03
2,REDACTED,en,3394,"We spent five nights here in January 2017 and it was lovely. The Westin is a first class hotel, with all the creature comforts you'd expect, and excellent service. When we arrived they put us in a room that we didn't like and they changed it right away upon our request. The bar on the top floor has an excellent view and surprisingly good wine. We also especially liked the location - it's in a quiet residential neighborhood, but it's only a 10-minute walk from the Ebisu Station. Ebisu Station is surrounded by small streets with local bars and restaurants - not at all like the glitzy and shiny scene in Roppongi or Ginza - but more like where ordinary Tokyo people go to eat or drink after work. We found it very relaxing after a hard day sightseeing, to go back to the hotel, regroup and refresh, and then wander over to Ebisu to discover another local establishment. I think if I were to live in Tokyo, that is where I would want to live.",5,2017/02/03
2,REDACTED,en,3395,"We have visited the Westin for many Christmas' and their festive holiday decor and spirit never disappoints. We booked directly on the hotel website a few weeks beforehand and were able to secure an extremely competitive weekly rate at 280 a night with buffet bfast. Unheard of for Tokyo for a five star hotel with large spacious rooms in a prime location. We also had lounge access because of our Starwood status. Breakfast, tea and sunset canapés are served in the lounge which offers nice respite after a long morning or day of walking. Beautiful bright views of the city and Tokyo tower are viewed from the lounge.

I love the Christmas spirit and decor at the hotel. The rooms are comfortable and spacious as well. While the hotel has classic decor that may look outdated, it is still immaculately maintained and showing no signs of wear or tear. Cleanliness is never an issue in Japan and at the Westin is the same. Beds are comfortable and each room has a nice soak tub and separate shower stall. Service is great.

Location is more neighborhoody which I love. The subway is a 10-15 min long walk away. Supermarkets and department stores are across the street. 

Service is excellent with fast response times. One negative is the concierge which missed the memo on holiday spirit and tend to suggest mediocre restaurants in the area even after repeated instructions that we did not want to stay in the area. Do your research before you arrive and ask them to make the reservations. I avoid asking for their suggestions which tend to be average and always nearby. 

We tried the coffee shop Japanese restaurant and Chinese restaurant during our stay. Skip the Chinese restaurant and coffee shop which is mainly buffet. Bfast buffet is ok and the Japanese breakfast is decent. Go outside to eat whenever you can.

Also a note about babies - cribs are provided however no baby bath tubs.",4,2017/02/02

Our room had a good city view and we could also see Mount Fuji from our room.,5,2017/01/31
2,REDACTED,en,3397,"Stayed here 4 nights on a business trip on the executive floor. Everything was terrific. Luxurious rooms that were whisper quiet. My room had a view of the city and Mount Fujii. The service was superior. For breakfast I was able to eat in the executive lounge or the main lobby restaurant. Both were included in the room price. The later had extensive, high quality offerings. The former had less choices but was so easy and convenient. The hotel lobby was elegant and the bars and restaurants were cool and of fantastic quality. The Westin is located in a relatively quiet area but is only a short walk to the train station.

Checked in by a very sweet lady by the name of Ms Mai Okano. She was so polite and patient. She was young but that did not stopped her from showing us utmost respect and hospitality. 

Ms Etsuko, the Chief Concierge (see picture) recognised us and warmly welcome us back to the hotel. As usual, she is spot on for getting around town. A best friend if you need one at the hotel... see you soon, Westin Tokyo.",5,2017/01/17

Had a club room on 17th floor which included buffet breakfast at their Terrace restaurant on 1st floor or breakfast at the lounge with less choices but still good . Afternoon tea and a cocktail 2 hours with light foods almost enough to skip a meal if you like . Easy 10 minute access to the JR rail line and 2 subway stops , one stop from Shibuya . Took a cab to get there from Haneda 7,700 yen and airport bus limousine to Narita when leaving which was 3,100 yen a piece . Have fun , nice hotel",5,2017/01/16

Our reservation included breakfast daily, which was a real treat. Delicious variety of food, pastries, juices, traditional Japanese breakfast, omelette station, french toast balls (AH-MA-ZING!), bread pudding bites, and more. 

The Concierge was able to book another Westin for us in Osaka, even though we ended up cancelling it in favour of another night in Kyoto. She certainly worked for it! She called 3 hotels in Osaka to price compare for us. All other staff were all smiles and help.

Great value for the space, breakfast, and location. Ebisu Station is a short walk through a shopping and office area, allowing you to get quickly around the city. 

Best part of all, we woke up on our first morning in Japan, open our curtains and see Mount Fuiji on a clear day. An unexpected milestone event.

Highly recommend.",5,2017/01/16

It is a surprisingly quiet and classy area despite being very close to Shibuya, Shinjuku, Harajuku etc. Subway is a short 5-10 min walk all undercover. There are lots of great restaurants around if you want to stay in the local area. We loved getting a morning coffee at Dean & Deluca near the subway. Hotel itself is of a great standard with very big rooms for Tokyo and great service. The lobby was stunning at Christmas time per the photo below. There are Michelin starred French restaurants just across the road if that is your thing. I'd stay here again without thinking.",5,2017/01/13

2,REDACTED,en,3405,"Visited The Westin again in April 2016 and this time round the experience was much better. I didn't saw the impolite and rude staff that I had encountered on my previous stay and I also skipped the Breakfast Buffet to avoid the same unpleasant experience this time round.

Check-in is smooth as usual and I requested for the same room view and the lady arranged it for me immediately. My room has a great view of the Tokyo Tower and I felt at home when I entered the room with the same setting.

As I visited during the peak Sakura season, the hotel provided the Sakura Bath Salt and also Sakura Tea Bag when I checked in. I felt that they could have done better by providing extra since I was there for 2 weeks but those were never refilled.

Cleanliness is top notch as usual, except that the housekeeping seems to always forget to leave a green card in my room. I usually request for bedsheet change every 2 days of my stay but I had to call the service desk to tell them that the card is missing from my room again and again. That happens during my first week of stay but the second week, it seems like it another batch of housekeeping staff on duty cause I can immediately sense the much better housekeeping of my room. 

Overall, another great stay at The Westin with some minor rooms for improvement. I will definitely choose Westin for my future business trip.",4,2017/01/04
2,REDACTED,en,3406,"This is a very good hotel and we recommended staying here. Like many gems, a few facets need polishing for enhancement. Wonderful, clean rooms and the service in the lobby bar is superb. The Compass Rose
Sky Lounge on the 22nd floor is a lost opportunity, however. With its commanding view of the Tokyo skyline, this could be a premier facility, but young & inattentive staff miss the mark. When we went to order a cocktail, we were told ""Oh, you're SPG"" in a dismissive tone and the regular menu was actually taken from our hands (quite a service faux pas), to be replaced with a dirty, water-stained limited one, lacking any beverage we preferred. After choosing one and then desiring to order bar food and additional cocktails, our party was ignored for 15 min. by a girl polishing glasses who refused to meet our gaze or give us the regular menu. It seems that SPG Gold and Platinum guests are somehow considered 2nd class, even though we are the brand's most loyal customers. The hotel's local wedding party catering seems to be superseding service to actual hotel guests. We informed the Compass Rose staff we were leaving and would go to the downstairs bar instead, due to lack of service or a menu. Connection to SPG and recognition of SPG guests can be a problem at some overseas hotels. Downstairs was a different story with great, highly trained staff of the first order. Some training is in order because properties should not be that uneven. Breakfast was good, but hotel guests were crowded out by day visitors. At Christmastime, throngs of the public crowd the hotel lobby to take photos at the tree; it’s wall-to-wall people. This is not a public park or fountain and impedes the guests and compromises hotel security. Lastly, security will need to be upgraded at this property and elevator key card access should absolutely be the norm for the elevators and guest floor access. This hotel does a very good job, but stricter training and upgraded security is definitely needed for this property.",4,2017/01/04

First and foremost, I wouldn’t stay anywhere else, but in this hotel when we return, it’s that great. The staff is exceptional and helped us with every detail. The location is ideal as it’s close to a new station with all new restaurants and shops. Every night we had cocktails and hot appetizers during happy hour and each morning we ate breakfast in the beautiful dining room that faces out to a garden. As a film critic, they even helped me communicate with Toho Studios by translating for me. I highly recommend this beautiful hotel. I loved the décor!

Older hotel but very well maintained and partially renovated. Traditional rooms, very clean and great views. Service at check-in was friendly and very good.

The mattress is a little harder than I’m accustomed to. However, this is very typical for most parts of Asia where it is believed that hard mattresses are better for one’s health.",5,2016/12/29

The hotel staff were excellent during our stay, always friendly and helpful. The Christmas decorations in the lobby were outstanding this year and the train set kept the kids mesmerized. 

We didn't have the breakfast this time round but enjoyed going to a bakery down the road for fresh bread in the morning.",5,2016/12/27

The attention to detail in this hotel is amazing. We love this place. 
The Christmas Eve string quartet and soprano at the lobby was really nice. 
Well done to the Christmas Team :)
Highly recommended. Special mention to Yuka Kawasaki at reception who took the effort to look after us well.

2,REDACTED,en,3412,"I went to Tokyo on business in September 2016. I stayed at the Westin Tokyo in Ebisu. It was a great hotel. The lobby was very nice and the staff were very friendly and helpful. My room was upgraded. It was very comfortable with a nice bed, bath/shower, air conditioning and free WIFI. The breakfast lounge was on the top floor. The food was good enough and there was a nice view. Ebisu is a bit far from the center but if you use the Tokyo subway it is not a problem. You can go out of the hotel through the Ebisu Beer Garden and then take the moving sidewalk all the way to Ebisu Station. The area around Ebisu Station is very busy in the evening and there are many restaurants both near the moving sidewalk and outside Ebisu Station. I will definitely stay here again for future business trips to Tokyo.",5,2016/12/22
2,REDACTED,en,3413,"We are vacation program owners with Vistana/Starwood which includes the Westin chain so we are fortunate enough to stay in Westins for many of our travels. The Tokyo Westin is very beautiful in its décor. My daughter really liked that they had kimonos in the drawers as robes. That really made her feel special.
There is a lovely garden and waterfall behind the hotel that is accessible via a stone pathway from the side of the hotel. The room had a nice view of the city and the bathroom was spectacular. As we were so busy getting out and about, we did not get a chance to use the pool or eat at the restaurants in the hotel. Just not enough time.
Something to be aware of... the beds are not American-sized. The room had 2 beds, but they were smaller in size than our full beds by American standards. They are oversized twins. So our daughter had one bed and my husband and I shared one. We were close, but so tired from all of our walking that we really didn't notice. However, if you are big and/or tall in size you will notice. If you are a couple, then you will likely each use your own bed.
Location wise, it is not in the heart of the Shinjuku district where all the fun stuff is, but everything is accessible via the subway or train. The Westin is close to a station, but it's a good 10 minute walk that is more noticeable at the end of a long day.
With a Westin, you always feel pampered.",5,2016/12/22
2,REDACTED,en,3414,"The Westin Tokyo is a very nice hotel in a very good location - calm neighbourhood. 
The train/subway station is close by allowing smooth transport to pretty much anywhere in Tokyo.

My SPG Platinum status was recognised and we were upgraded to a Club Level room with a very nice view of Tokyo.

Rooms are big and clean. The staff is courteous and attentive. Upon leaving they had packed us breakfast since we left for the airport before the restaurant/lounge opened - a very nice gesture.

One of the best things with Westin is the possibility to borrow training gear, so there is no need to carry this with you. The gym is small but good.

Highly recommended and I would not hesitate to return.",5,2016/12/17

Ebisu is a great location if you don't need to be in the center of Tokyo, and the hotel is very convenient to the Ebisu station, with easy, fast service to every part part of the city, and beyond. The hotel has extensive convenient shopping, and a vast array of dining and bar choices, all within a brief walk. 

During my most recent visit, the hotel and Ebisu Garden City, were decked out in holiday decorations. It was beautiful. The hotel centerpiece included a large Christmas tree, complete with two model trains running around its base.

Yes, we did go back to see Jiro Tsuge in May 2016 for 3 days as promised.
This time I realized Jiro is the Assistant Manager and not the Concierge I previously thought. Still, he did not even blink. Another fine example of the excellent staff at Westin Ebisu. On our last visit, we were unable to make the purchase due to time issue.
This time he personally made the phone call to the duty free store in Narita, so the print by Utagawa Hiroshige will be on hold for us. What a conclusion to exemplary service!",5,2016/12/10

I had breakfast at the hotel which had a lovely choice of local and international options. I was happy to walk around alone in the area to and from the Ebisu train station (10 minutes walk) . Staff are very accommodating and provided me with good advice on travel around Tokyo and an email from the concierge in advance of my stay gave me directions from the airport, so I didn't need to use the expensive taxi option.",5,2016/12/09
2,REDACTED,en,3419,"We stayed here at the end of our Tokyo trip having previously stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Shinjuku. Both time in Club level rooms.I wish we had stayed at the Hyatt again - it was cheaper than the Westin and better located.

The hotel is nice but extremely dated. The decor is very '90s - pretty tacky. A change of wallpaper and curtains would greatly help. The room itself was very big - great size for tokyo. But pretty old fashioned.

The lounge breakfast was terrible but they gave you the option to also use the downstairs terrace restaurant which has a fantastic breakfast buffet. Evenings in the lounge offer 2 hours of drinks and snacks. Again very basic and often over crowded so that they had people sitting in a meeting room in the back. The food was pretty terrible. There are great views from the lounge but the decor is very, very old fashioned. 

The gym is small but well appointed. 

The hotel is about a 10-15 minute walk from the nearest subway,depending on which line you want. So it's certainly not as convenient as the Hyatt, which has basement access to the subway. Especially when raining.

Overall, the experience was ok but disappointing for a Westin. I wouldn't stay here again. Maybe we got a bad price, but it was not worth it.",3,2016/12/07

The location of this hotel is really the key. It is located in the beautiful Ebisu area with lots of things to do and local restaurants to explore.

Staff are friendly and concierge extremely helpful (thanks for Restaurant reservation help). Executive lounge on 17th has breakfast, food all day and into early evening. Dining options galore and buffet is not bad value at $35/person. Rooms could use some renovations, but adequate. Only drawback would be that there are still smoking rooms/floors. I thought Westin was globally non-smoking? In any event, for good value (Rooms in the $275 range) you are doing very well for Tokyo. Ebisu station about 10 minutes walk by Moving Sidewalk. Good luck and enjoy!",4,2016/11/27
2,REDACTED,en,3424,"Typical and exceptional Western service. English speaking staff and great value. A good bar in the lobby. Great venue for breakfast. Very clean hotel, but getting dated. Thin walls and long access to elevators. The rooms are traditional and a bit dated by many standards off today.

The Wi-Fi can be spotty. 

Great views if you get the city view. Easy check in, quick and helpful. Very good restaurant at the top level. Great French cuisine. A great bar with the fantastic meal on the top floor with a smoking section. Mango martinis are to die for. 

This hotel does not have a pool. Access to City Centre is about $25 by taxi. As it is crowded and primarily single carriageway this could take 15 minutes.

2,REDACTED,en,3429,"The Westin in Ebisu is a marble palace. The location about a 10 min walk from Ebisu station is reachable via a covered walkway. The hotel is not new and the design seems to be marble overload but faced with $500 hotels in Tokyo the Westin finds a comfortable space in the high 200's that is good value. The breakfast buffet is extensive with an omelet bar, fresh fruit, smoothies as well as a full selection of western and asian specialities. It's enough to get you through into early afternoon. The gym is a bit crowded early in the morning when the newly arrived are all in sleep deprived exercise mania but the equipment is in good order but you may have to wait a few minutes at 6:30am...

There is a excellent local raman shop around the corner that is heaven, silky noodle goodness for 800 yen with a side of gyosa. Exit the hotel in the main entrance and go to the right across the main intersection and take the next small side street on the left an dic is on your left...you will not regret the trip.",4,2016/11/15
2,REDACTED,en,3430,"This was the first trip my husband and I had ever taken to Tokyo. We met friends who have been to Tokyo twice before. They recommend the Westin Tokyo. The website did not do it justice. I was expecting a nice hotel. What we got was spectacular! The property is beautiful. The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful. The room was fantastic! Large, clean, wonderful in-room coffee and tea. And even the little soaps and such were great. We ate at the breakfast bar once (we usually avoid hotel breakfasts). We were impressed with the selection and quality. The bar on the 22nd floor is very nice (but be expected to spend A LOT of money). We loved the big round ice cubes and the breathtaking view of the Tokyo skyline. I cannot say enough about this property. And it is close to public transportation and to the best ramen restaurant we have ever experienced (recommended by the front desk staff). 
When we left it felt like we were saying good bye to dear friends and family. 
Because we had never been to Tokyo we didn't have any idea about traveling from place to place. We thought it was a good idea to change hotels during our stay. It turned out to be an unfortunate choice. After staying at this property we regretted moving to another highly rated hotel. 
We agree that The Westin Tokyo was one of the best hotels we've experienced in our vacation travels. We will be back.",5,2016/11/14

Nothing is too much trouble for the staff, whatever you want, and they attend to you immediately.
The area, Ebisu, is so beautiful, we often just walk around the streets in the evenings, so safe.
The train station is only 10 minutes walk away, and even there at the train station there is a shopping centre with so many places to eat

2,REDACTED,en,3434,"My first time to Tokyo, so I'm glad it was at a Westin. I can't find anything to complain about. I was upgraded to a large room on the 16th floor. It was clean and well appointed. During my three-day stay, I never once heard any obtrusive noise, whether from the street, the air conditioning, the pipes, or the shower in the room next door (all of which I have suffered at one time or another in other hotels). The club lounge had a wide assortment of very nice foods throughout the day; I particularly appreciated the smoked salmon available for breakfast. Note to business travelers: the Westin is not in downtown Tokyo, but it's a 5-10 minute walk to Ebisu Station (depending on how fast you are) and a few stops to many places in the city center.

2,REDACTED,en,3435,"Where am I? First let me say this hotel was outstanding. Room was clean and comfortable and the service was impeccable. I speak zero Japanese and never ran into any problems during my stay. 

That said, there is nothing to make this hotel stand out; meaning, there was no Japanese vibe to it. From inside the premises, it could have been any country. I'm sure that doesn't matter to a lot of travelers, particularly those on business, but for a tourist like myself I was hoping for something with a bit more influence from the local culture. 

Proximity to the train is a HUGE plus, as it got me to lots of shopping districts. In addition, handful of upscale restaurants within walking distance. That includes Lawrys, the famous steakhouse, another place that made me feel like I was back in California. But that's probably just nitpicking because Westin Tokyo is the sort of hotel I would recommend if consistency is your top priority.",4,2016/11/05

The breakfast bar and sitting provides a big choice of European and Japanese cuisine.
The area is quiet in a residential area of Tokyo up and coming with lots of choice for shopping malls and easy access to the underground. From the hotel we visited most tourist sites in the city.
The staff and reception were very courteous and helpful. There is a small feature garden outside the hotel worht while to walk around it, designed by a famous local gardener.

2,REDACTED,en,3452,"Stayed at the Westin for a week and the staff were great. Day one offered a small inconvenience, my wife and I were shown our room and we were surprised to find two single beds. The suggested solution ....we could push them together. Not the right answer folks.
Staff were great although maybe the concierge could be a little more knowledgeable about ""things to see and do"" and helpful with regards booking things rather than simply handing out brochures and leaving the guest to figure it out.
The hotel does not have a pool (which I found strange) but they do have an arrangement with a nearby facility if a guest wants to swim. The issue is there is a 2,500 yen per day for the privilege which is expensive if you want to go do your laps. so 5,000 yen for my wife and I to take a dip. Note to management. The cost is not published so if you really feel you need to charge your guests for a facility that the vast majority of hotels in your category have onsite for free it is only fair to inform them before they ask where to pool is ie on your web site.
Since we had a late flight out of Tokyo we checked out at normal time, left our bags in the care of the hotel (thank you) with a view to collecting them later. We asked if there was a shower we could use to freshen up before we went to the airport and there was another charge. 
Got your money so off you go was the feeling we were left with.
We actually paid one third of The Westin's proposed charge to utilise a great facility at Haneda airport.
All in all the general staff were excellent but they were let down by some poor management decisions",4,2016/10/10
2,REDACTED,en,3453,"My wife and I stayed at the Westin Tokyo in 2015. I can't say enough for the place. The rooms were downright palatial by Tokyo standards. Further, the location cannot be beat. Because Ebisu station is just a short walk away, cab travel was barely necessary during our stay in Tokyo.",5,2016/10/10
2,REDACTED,en,3454,"Great rooms, a bit slow in terms Check-in but over all a great service attitude, warm welcoming staff; great breakfast @ Terrace or at the Executive Club, central located in the heart of the business and shopping zone!

Windows are sound proof and you can get a good night's sleep. Coffee maker could be upgraded. Bed was comfortable but the pillows might need an upgrade from foam to down. Fitness area is really crowded in the peak 6-8am time but fine after the rush. Staff is always professional and attentive. The breakfast buffet is always impressive (recommend booking it with your room to save a little money). The lobby lounge is fun in the afternoon for tea/coffee and cakes/desserts.

The staff are always welcoming and helpful. The room decor falls in line with a more classic time and are maintained to a good standard. This hotel is right outside the heart of Tokyo which allows for a peaceful night of sleep after a long night out in the city with good access to public and private transportation. This is my second time staying with this hotel and I plan to visit again in the near future.

2,REDACTED,en,3459,"We stayed here for 4 nights in September 2016. We had 3 rooms for our family. We enjoyed the hotel and location. The hotel was a big hotel but was very comfortable and close to Ebisu station so easy to get around Tokyo. The rooms were nice, a bit dated but still clean and comfortable and the views are great. Breakfast variety was good, a bit chaotic on the weekend and there was a bit of a wait for a table but that is ok and to be expected. We liked the location being a little out of the craziness of some of the other areas of Tokyo but still close and easy to get around.",4,2016/09/25
2,REDACTED,en,3460,"The hotel is a true five star hotel. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom equally so with a tub and a walk-in shower just the way I like it. There's a huge window giving the guest a feeling of openness and a view of the city. There's an SPG lounge on the 17th floor for those awkward times when you got nothing better to do. Some people choose to have breakfast there while others even dined on the snacks in the evening. Breakfast is served on the ground floor and it's comprehensive and has everything one desires. 

Service is what you'd expect from a five star hotel and much more. Staff are friendly and always ready to help. I very much appreciated the turndown service. 

The hotel is well located within a walking distance of the train station and a metro station. There's a department store across the street and plenty of food outlets and shopping across the street and at the massive train station. There's also plenty of food and shopping options at the street level. 

Stay at the Westin Tokyo, you will not regret it.",5,2016/09/21
2,REDACTED,en,3461,"Stayed for 3 nights in this AMAZING hotel with my family. And was shocked by the luxury and services provided. Check in went very smooth and quick. Rooms were elegant, bit small, but totally enough space for 2 people. Breakfast was outstanding, food was delicious and staff are showing very good care for guests. But our expirience would not be full without Yebisu Teppanyaki restaurant on one of the top floors. All of my family was amazed by skillfull cooking of chef, his guest communication skills and the taste of the food. All seafood (lobsters, abalone etc) is fresh and still alive before being cooked. Moreover it has a great view of the city and mountains ! If you ever come to Westin Tokyo, this restaurant is a must to visit in order to feel the food and beverage cultural aspects of Japan ! Thank you to all of the hotel staff for makeing such an unforgetable expirience !",5,2016/09/19

2,REDACTED,en,3463,This hotel is fabulous! The staff is beyond kind and helpful! You will always be greeted with a smile! The rooms are clean and spacious. Our stay was all-around fantastic! The food was pricey but consider where you're traveling. We loved the location as it is a short walk to the train station. Getting around is super easy and that's coming from someone who doesn't use public transportation. We loved Japan and hope to return someday!,5,2016/09/12
2,REDACTED,en,3464,"We stayed here on a business trip and were very happy with the hotel. The lobby and grounds are well-tended. Fresh flowers in the lobby, a Japanese garden and koi pond outside, a great breakfast and friendly staff enhanced our stay. The location is great for access to the subway.
On the minus side, dinners at the hotel's various restaurants are extremely pricey and not a good value. There is also no good place to have a drink in the lobby area. The large lounge area in the lobby is more of a formal tea & cake area. The only bar is small and a CIGAR bar! Every evening we were there, one man would be smoking a cigar and ruining the only spot to sit and have a cocktail in the entire hotel. Note to hotel: Make this a regular non-smoking bar and send smokers to a smaller different venue. 
Perhaps this was more of a cultural issue, but seating at the bar above was very ""regulated"", meaning you couldn't just seat yourself at one of the ten or so stools. The staff has a rigid idea of where customers need to position themselves, reason unknown. We'd have to wait and see which stools they pointed us to...very different than other Westins.",5,2016/09/10
2,REDACTED,en,3465,"I love this hotel. It's my first time staying at Westin Tokyo. The room is nice and clean, and it comes with nice amenities and the bathroom is wonderful! The best place in the room is the bathroom! The location is not too closed to Ebisu station, it's about 15 minutes walking passing by a nice Yebisu garden, and shopping malls. The nice thing is, there is a short cut to the hotel, it makes the trip faster to and from the hotel to the station.",5,2016/09/07

We found the staff extremely helpful with any question, including arrangements for shipping part of our luggage ahead of us to meet us in Kyoto. This seemed to be a popular hotel with both business people and families, both domestic and international.

Rooms were spacious although a little old. There was little in the way of multimedia attachments, but everything worked fine. 

The area is about 10 minutes walk from the train station and the trains there require another change if you want to go to NRT. Not a good option if you have anything more than a light roller suitcase. Not much life right at the hotel, but plenty to eat and drink within 10 minutes walk (back near the station).",4,2016/08/09

For sure I will return ( when ""someone else"" pay...)",5,2016/08/05
2,REDACTED,en,3478,"This might come across as a rant. 

But it is certainly not. You can check all my other reviews. I almost always say something good about places I've been to. 

This is an equally honest review. I would have given a zero rating if I could. 

[I'm finalising this review at 228 am - because I still can't get to sleep. I started writing this piece at 108 am. Anything in ""[ ]"" below are added just now - after I've gone downstairs to complain. That didn't help as I'm even more annoyed now]. 

I'm writing this having checked into the hotel yesterday afternoon. I'm writing this after having been woken up by a hotel staff about 30 minutes ago. I'm writing this because I cannot get back to sleep [and I still can't after another 90 minutes. Because I'm so angry. Because my whole family is now awake. [My daughter is still awake - as I am adding this bit in]. And I need to wake up at 7 tomorrow am [and therefore can't take sleeping pills as I can't afford to oversleep.] I've never written a review before checking out of a place. I'm doing this to make sure I get all the facts right.

This is not the first time I stay at this hotel. I've stayed here few times before. Mostly very pleasant. In fact - I would always stay here when I'm in Tokyo if they have room available. 

I might have even given it a good review before. If there is any way I can remove that / them - I would. 

Background - we took two rooms. A connected set of rooms. Kids in one room - my wife and I in the other. Doors between the 2 rooms were opened during the incident. 

The call from the hotel staff [@0043 - as I was told by the staff when ""I"" went downstairs to complain] was supposed to be in reaction to a call from the guys downstairs - to the kids room. [I was told the complaint was made @0035]. 

Apparently the complaint was that there were running noises coming from the kids room. My kids have been in bed for at least 45 minutes and there shd have been little to no movement except for my son going to the toilet and my wife checking on the kids. This is past midnight. Important fact.

To make things worst - the call from the hotel was made to the kids room - so they got woken up - and are still awake right now. 

In fact - there were two calls. The first one I needed to run over to their room to pick up and I missed that call. I was in bed myself in the next room. The second one I picked up [Sorry Westin - you made me do it - I needed to ""run"" to pick up - I really didn't want my kids to wake up].

In fact my kids got very scared of the phone ringing in the middle of the night. Has anyone seen the Japanese film 午夜兇鈴 (the Ring)? 

One pays a fair sum for a decent night sleep DO NOT expect to get woken up in middle of the night. Not for something completely uncalled for. There is no point of investing in and advertising you have great and comfy beds - when guests get waken up in the middle of the night.

Did the hotel management check if indeed there was noise? [They said they did and ""apparently"" hung around outside our rooms for 10-15 minutes - NOTE the timings stated above of the complaint and the calls I received - and draw your own conclusion]. 

They could have come upstairs and listened at the door and they would realise there was no running. [When I confronted them just now - they said there was ""talking"" - so even talking is not allowed in this hotel. My goodness. The talking wld have been between me and my wife. Even if there was talking - it was not loud. I can guarantee there was no shouting between me and my wife tonight. Just ordinary talking at ordinary voice level].

I'm almost 100 percent sure they did not check. If they did - I would not have received the call. [I asked why they called and not knocked at the door instead if they were outside my room. They said it would have been rude had they made a call. And from that I assume their conclusion / training was that would not be rude to call and wake up my entire family]. 

Or this building is so flimsily built that even tip toeing can be heard. And house rule is you cannot talk with your wife.

Or could the footsteps heard be caused by other phenomenon???????

In fact, I'm so angry and will go downstairs to complain now. [I did - and the bits in ""[ ]"" are what I added just now after confronting the manager on duty].

Housekeeping always do their best to keep my room clean and tidy.

Chinese restaurant not very delicious comparing with Palace hotel.

SPG Platinum suite upgrade is a only a dream at Westin Tokyo, for 15 years I only had one time suite upgrade on the second night which the room on first night was smelly and it was 7 years ago.

I think this hotel is overrated and over price.",2,2016/07/26
2,REDACTED,en,3481,"Not the best location in Tokyo (though 10mn walk to Ebisu station of the Yamanote line) but great modern facilities. The rooms are large by Japanese standards. Very friendly services and great restaurants (Sushi, Teppanyaki, Chinese are great!)

2,REDACTED,en,3482,"My wife and I stayed here for two nights during a recent week long trip to the Tokyo area (the other nights were in Chiba at the Hotel New Otani Majuhari in Chiba). We arrived on a Sunday evening and were quite tired after a long day of travel. Check in was quick and efficient and with SPG Platinum status were upgraded to a room on the Club Level and advised of our benefits. Platinum breakfast was offered in both the club lounge or in the buffet restaurant on the first floor.

The room was very nice with a good sized bathroom including a full separate shower with both a rainfall showerhead and a second detachable head. There was a full tub, a Toto equipped toilet and a nice sink area. 

The rest of the room was well equipped with a coffee maker, water heater for making tea, a sitting area, a desk with hard wired internet connection (wifi also available), and a Westin Heavenly bed.

The lounge on the 17th floor offered a decent but not overly impressive breakfast. We ate here on Monday morning, which was a holiday in Japan. We had first gone down to the lobby but noticed there was a long queue to get into the lobby buffet restaurant. Apparently this is a regular problem on weekends and holidays at this hotel and the Westin Tokyo should consider opening the outside seating and perhaps expanding the restaurant in the future.

On Tuesday morning we had breakfast in the lobby restaurant. It was less busy and a big step up from what was offered in the lounge. I would definitely recommend trying to eat downstairs whenever possible.

Service was universally excellent in the hotel from the front desk staff, to the bell persons, to the lounge and restaurant staff, as well as the concierge. Everything was super clean and well maintained. I did not get a chance to use the Westin Workout.

If you are in the area I would definitely recommend the Westin Tokyo.",5,2016/07/23
2,REDACTED,en,3483,"Great stay at this ""suburban"" Westin- 10 minute walk through lovely Yebisu Gardens to get to the Ebisu station for the subway and the JR train line- We had an updated room, though I reserved only the least expensive king bed- beautiful bathroom with marble and a shower and tub and the TOTO toilet- large room and great view too- very comfortable bed and delicious green tea bags!! Service throughout the hotel was friendly, very polite and helpful. The breakfast buffet ( reserve in advance- its less expensive) was large, high quality and worked for our vegetarian needs. Great fresh juice and lychees!! Great mix of ""American"" foods and also Japanese items- Good service- If I return to Tokyo, would seriously consider staying here again- Great time-",5,2016/07/20
2,REDACTED,en,3484,"Firstly, this is NOT the hotel for you if you want to exit the lobby and be right smack in the middle of a tourist location. Westin is located in a more quiet location called Meguro, a good place where you can really wind down after a long day out. 

Let's start with accessibility, Ebisu JR and Metro is located around 10mins walking(with the help of travelators) distance away. Access is thru B1 of the hotel and the whole journey is covered. So even if it rains you won't get wet. Shibuya and Harajuku Stations are just 1 to 2 stops away.

There are plenty of restaurants around the hotel, you would pass through a few of them walking to the JR/Metro Stations. There is even more restaurants and shops in the station building itself. So affordable food/meals are nearby.

Rooms are pretty spacious, staffs' service is excellent, even help us book a great Kobe Beef restaurant(also reviewed here called Hakushu) 1 week before we arrive. If you have club lounge access, check it out at night, on the extreme right you would be able to see Tokyo Tower. Club lounge has good enough spread for breakfast, we had ours there for 4 days and the kids never complain about getting bored with the food. There is no age restriction in the lounge so kids are allowed. 

Overall a great stay in Tokyo. When coming in from Narita/Haneda there is a limo bus service from the airport that takes you to this hotel. So if you are travelling with heavy luggage forget about the trains and save yourself some trouble. Estimated travel time from Narita is close to 1.5-2 hours depending on traffic. Haneda would be a lot faster, as it is so much closer.",5,2016/07/18

The staff speaks english and was on their toes to serve the customers! Breakfast was fabulous with an array of both asian and american entrees. The Nespresso in the rooms is an added plus! Prior to arriving, I had a lot of questions thru email and the response was quick and complete. The rooms are larger compared to the typical hotel rooms in Tokyo.

2,REDACTED,en,3493,"My wife and I just spent a total of eleven nights at this hotel. And, we could not have asked for a better experience. The Front Desk was wonderful throughout the stay- thank you for selecting such a nice room for us. Service Express was perfect as well. Every wake up call on time, prompt service for all of our needs - well done. Housekeeping was ""spot on"" perfect as well. They respected the ""Do Not Disturb"" requests and were always available when we needed them. They also did a great job. Well done! 

The happy hour for the Platinum guests is wonderful and the Breakfast Buffet at the property was impressive as well. Finally, the hotel is perfectly located right outside the Ebisu Station, which takes you virtually everywhere throughout Tokyo. There are many great restaurants right next to the hotel as well (including Lawry's Prime Rib). 

We had our bags shipped ahead of us to our next destination (Kyoto Westin) and Mohammad not only handled that for us perfectly, but also assisted us throughout the stay with a variety of our requests. Thank you Mohammad for making our stay so perfect. You were a great help. 

The Concierge at this hotel ""stole the show"". They were all great, but most notably Ai Watanabe. Ai can only be described as a ""lovely breathe of fresh air"". You will really enjoy working with her. She has a vast knowledge of the entire hotel as well as the City of Tokyo. I believe she was at the front desk before becoming a Concierge. I have no doubt she will run a Starwood property in the future, if that is what she wants to do. 

I have a hobby that is shared by a gentleman from Tokyo. We had discussed our mutual hobby a number of times via email through Google translate. We planned to meet while I was in Tokyo. The only problem was that I did not speak a lick of Japanese nor did my internet friend speak very much English. We made a plan to meet at the hotel. 

I asked Ai what alternatives I had with respect to my meeting. After all, I had no easy method to communicate with my internet friend. It just so happened that my early evening meeting with my internet friend was scheduled at the hotel for a time that Ai was just getting off work. Ai graciously agreed to essentially be our translator at our near two hour meeting! Again, she did this on her own personal time. Thank you so much Ai and I only hope that at some point in the future my wife and I can return the favor to you (perhaps one day in California where we reside). 

In short, our (11) night stay was near perfect in all respects. We look forward to returning to the hotel one day in the future. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. Thank you again Ai for making our stay super special! Again, they should promote you to management as you would make a sensational hotel manager!",5,2016/07/10

2,REDACTED,en,3495,"This hotel is a very good Westin. Wonderful rooms, service, amenities, in short everything you would expect of a better Westin property. The location is a little bit removed from the subway system, requiring an unchallenging 10 minute stroll to the JR station and 15 minutes to the Metro but even that is a plus point since it puts the hotel in a quiet and peaceful location in the middle of bustling Tokyo.

I docked two stars from this hotel simply because the breakfast restaurant is an absolute zoo. The food offerings are good but there is a long QUEUE to get in every morning. I had breakfast here twice and both times i had to wait 10 to 15 minutes. There was a queue of about 15 to 20 people at 9am each morning. I have never had to wait for more than a minute or two before being seated for breakfast at a five star hotel before and this is simply ridiculous for a business hotel where fast and efficient breakfast service is mandatory. Poorly done and needs immediate improvement!",3,2016/07/09

2,REDACTED,en,3500,"Stayed 4 nights in a Delux non smoking room. Was on an early flight in and checked in at 7am and was very surprised when a room was available . Great service and welcomed after a long flight.
Room was large with desk and couch area. Decor is old school and clean and pristine. Amenities are good. Nice bath and shower. 
Disappointed no in house movies but you can rent DVDs next door for free.
Coffee great in the room.
Milk is powdered but tasted fine.
Location of this hotel is a 5 min walk from Ebisu station all undercover.
There is a small department store next door with variety of restaurants and shops.
We found great restaurants a few streets a way and the concierge service is great at Westin. They give you maps and recommendations for whatever you need. 
I would recommend this as fair value for location and hotel standard.",4,2016/06/25
2,REDACTED,en,3501,"Stayed at this hotel for the long weekend. The hotel itself is very modern and centrally located. The facilities are great and the extra bits you are given in the room like shower caps, mouth wash, hair brushes , shaving gel and razors are cute additions. There are nice restaurants about but we only managed to eat downstairs at the Spanish themed buffet, which was ok with desserts variety probably outweighing the western Spanish foods(they did have jamon but better off without) Price was relatively normal($80-90pp) considering where it is. We also had lunch at teppanyaki restaurant upstairs which we enjoyed a great deal as well. It is a bit treacky with small children though as japanese do not enjoy any above average talking volume, so we felt bad we had to shush our children even though they were just talking at normal voices and not yelling and being abnoxious. 
It's a bit of walk from hotel to the train station, but it's all connected between buildings. Trains are faster and a tad cheaper to move around. Taxis are expensive as expected. Starting fee 730 yen so not so tourist friendly. 
Hotel did have a good breakfast and dinner and even cocktail offer for members upstairs in their lounge, so we enjoyed that. They do not have a swimming pool on premises , 5-10 min walk.
It was a great short stay but wish it was a bit closer to the station. This hotel was located at Ebisu station only 1 stop away from Shibuya.",5,2016/06/22
2,REDACTED,en,3502,"This dated hotel feels like a 1980's French throwback - all pink marble, black tile and gold furnishings done in a French style. From the public space to the rooms the hotel is clean and in great shape...just horribly out of style and badly in need of an update!!

The bar has closed brass doors, all cushy carpet and dim light, very old school and boring. The restaurants (other than terrace) are overly fussy affairs with set menus and very expensive. The Terrace offers a nice breakfast buffet ($32 for adults, $20 for children) and ala carte dinner menu. Oddly, when we were there in June they had a Spanish buffet nightly for the month! So every night we were there was the same set of dishes, the same Spanish CD on, it was out of sync with the Japanese experience we would have liked.... typically a hotel may have a themed night but every day is unusual. 

The rooms are typically sized, two sinks and separate shower stall and tub. The housekeeping staff here is amazing; polite, thorough and efficient. They even take the shower head and drain cover out and clean them! Free water in room and wifi and a very helpful staff (from front desk to concierge) helped us to plan out our days. 

We were in town for a family vacation and the location of the hotel is out of the way; more suitable for corporate or group guests. We used starwood points and so had limited options. For a leisure trip, would stay elsewhere. There are few (if any) area restaurants or sights worth visiting without cab or train.",3,2016/06/21

The main lobby is absolutely breathtaking and the hotel is located in a quiet neighborhood southwest of downtown. The nearest metro is about a 10min walk away.

The room was clean and nice. Not huge by US standards but from what I know about Japanese hotels, it was quite large. Breakfast had a large variety of options for all travelers. The gym was smaller than it seemed in the pictures but definitely functional for the business traveler.",4,2016/06/19

Room service, hotel employees, all, are just wonderful. The whole city and people are great. The hotel restaurants are excellent. I tried the Japanese Mai restaurant, will write a separate review with photos, The Lounge where I had the most delicious carrot cake, and The Compass Rose. The Executive Lounge is excellent too.

Stayed in an executive room with access to the lounge - tremendous views from room (20th floor) and club lounge where you can see Mount Fuji on a clear day
AS it was a special anniversary, the hotel delivered a bottle of sparkling wine and fruit a few moments after we had checked into our room - a really welcome surprise for us
Metro a few minutes walk away and a shopping centre / restaurants a few minutes walk from the hotel
Must say this is one of the best hotels we have stayed in so highly recommended
Quite a distance from the airport but take the limousine bus which ends at the hotel",5,2016/06/15
2,REDACTED,en,3507,"The Westin is a nice place to stay and a great option if you need to be in the Ebisu area. 

The highlight for me is the Japanese garden, with the waterfall, koi ponds, and various plants very relaxing and zen place to relax on a nice day. 

Rooms are comfy and spacious if a bit dated. 
Buffet has a good selection, though can occasionally be lines in the morning when the hotel is fully booked. 
Gym is decently equipped with free weights, some weight and running machines, and is usually not very busy.
Main issue is no pool in the hotel. You can pay extra to visit a pool in a separate building that can be reached by an underground walkway.",4,2016/06/13

Great breakfast (loving the Japanese breakfast and the healthy juice). 

No swimming pool in the building, but they provide a pool 1-2 minutes away for the hotel guests for free. The hotel has classic decor, not to my taste, but it's not an issue for me.

Great garden (a big plus), great location. As always in Japan, you can't beat the service :)",4,2016/06/11
2,REDACTED,en,3511,"Service and room quality is very good. The staffs are courtesy and provide good service. All that comes with the price. Great for business but tough for family trip on a budget. 10mins walk from Ebisu station, it is not near attractions and limited range of F&B within the region. The only thing I didnt like is the pillow is way too soft. I couldnt get a good sleep and have to stack 3 pillows together.

There are better choices if u are on budget and need it nearer to attraction and main train stations.",4,2016/06/10
2,REDACTED,en,3512,"we got 2 nights stay here as a gift from my brother in law using his points. 

not sure whether this is just for ""executive club"" but the service was incredible. the concierge were so helpful with helping us book restaurants prior to our stay through email (though they only book for the days you are staying at Westin) all the staff spoke English well. we had a sake a few nights prior & tried to track it down at multiple department stores & sake shops around Tokyo with no luck. when we finally found a sake shop online that sold it, they only sold it in a huge bottle which we couldn't bring back to Australia. the Westin concierge then helped us to track a sake shop that sold it in a 720ml bottle and managed to do it within hours of our arrival.

the hotel itself is grand; with many western guests. English is spoken all around so it almost feels like you are in a western country. the room is great; beds are comfortable. 

I would say the only issue would be the location; it's about 10-15 walk to the nearest station. comfortable walk by the underpass links with shops, etc. but we came home late one night and the shopping center had closed so we couldn't use our normal route, and the walk home was a bit tricky and long. taxi from ebisu station is about 800 yen. I guess that most people who can afford to stay at Westin would probably just take a cab; so maybe this location issue is just for us.

one of the best stays in Tokyo otherwise!",4,2016/06/08
2,REDACTED,en,3513,"The WESTIN is an upscale hotel in a residential neighborhood. It's some distance from the usual Tokyo tourist destinations, but it has easy access to Tokyo mass transit through underground tunnels. Service level was impeccable.

A variety of restaurants and bars to relax in an enjoy. The breakfast has a wide selection which everyone will enjoy.
The subway is at your doorstep so access to the wonders of Tokyo is so handy.

A little inconvenient for transport from Ebisu Station (JR & subway) that is made easier with a long covered speedwalk escalator with covered lower level walkway through the shopping area to the lower floor of the hotel. (Turn right just before the outside exit of the speedwalk, not problem with rolling luggage.) Nice room and very good service. Excellent SPG lounge with good cocktail hour.

2,REDACTED,en,3519,"This is our third stay at this hotel and each time has been very comfortable. The rooms are good sized by Japanese standards. We actually CHOOSE to dine in the restaurants in this hotel on their own merit. The traditional Japanese in MAI restaurant is very good. Even when delivered as room service. With a nice list of both Sake and Shochu. The teppanyaki restaurant on the 23rd floor has a beautiful view, but the food shines as bright as the lights of the city at night. None of the kitsch you normally expect from this kind of place. And actually VERY good food. Spend the money. Get the Kobe and get the lobster.",5,2016/05/26
2,REDACTED,en,3520,"My boyfriend and I stayed here a few nights while vacationing in Japan. While I absolutely loved the hotel - the room, service, and amenities were great - the location was unfortunately a major drawback for us. This is a great hotel if you are on a business trip, but if you are vacationing and want to explore Tokyo (which was our goal), this is probably not your best bet. The hotel is in Ebisu/Meguro and is probably a 10 min walk from the Ebisu train station. While this doesn't sound far, walking it several times a day gets old and fast. There's not much going on near the hotel or in Ebisu so you'll be using the train a lot! The one plus is the Ebisu station is one train stop away from Shibuya which is a main center in Tokyo. Lastly, the hotel has a very ""business-y"" feel so unless you're planning to wear a suit everyday (I'm on vacation so no thanks!) you can expect to feel a bit out of place.",4,2016/05/25
2,REDACTED,en,3521,"The hotel is your typical Westin in terms of decor. Think lots of marble, and columns. It's not necceserily my style, but we weren't there to decorate. It's all well kept and clean with all the modern amenities you would expect from 5* hotel. We had an access to club room, which offered decent breakfast and dinner and free snack through the day.
Staff was great, everyone we encountered was extremely nice and helpful. Concierge spent half an hour on the phone to help us sort out some plane ticket issues.
Gym is quite inadequate. Especially for the size of the hotel. But they do offer access to a very modern facility right across the street that you can access via underpass that connects directly to the hotel.
What made it a great stay is the location. It's near a park and more importantly located in nice 'young' residential neighborhood. There's countless small local restaurants, boutiques and quirky stores all around. It's not a tourist area, so communication could be a problem if you don't speak Japanese (we don't), but where there's a will there's a way and we got to enjoy some great food. It's also two stops, or about 30 min easy walk from Shibuya, which is worth checking out. Short cab ride to Shinagawa station where you can catch a Narrita Express direct train to and from airport.
Overall great stay and we can recommend staying here.",5,2016/05/18
2,REDACTED,en,3522,"First, the GOOD - the location of Westin is ideal for family. I was torn between this location and Shinjuku (Hilton/Park Hyatt) and while I wanted to stay at the Park Hyatt, I'm so very glad my wife convinced me to stay at the Westin. If you haven't been to Tokyo, and you are traveling with little kids, there is no better option. The hotel is connect to the Mitsukoshi department store as well as the Yebisu Garden Tower which has several good underground restaurants as well as the high end restaurants on the 37th floor. There is also a Burger King so it's good for kids. There's a beer garden for the adults, just FYI. The nearest subway station is the Ebisu station and it is about a 10 minute walk from the Westin but it has people mover so the walk isn't too bad. More importantly, because you can go from the Westin to the station through the underground connection (directly from the elevator of Westin to inside the actual station) this is great for hot/raining/snowy/etc... whatever weather condition. the hotel is a little bit dated. The hotel also provides all the amenities that you can ask for but you can tell it's still holding onto its glory days of the 80's. That said, everything is clean and the rooms are kept extremely clean. The service is as expected of a Westin. They are professional and they provide you with everything you need. The best impression we received was from the bellhop and the concierge who went out of their way to provide our children with mini erasers (Japanese/Korean love erasers, pencils, stationary, etc) that the kids were thrilled. They also provide a coloring book with color pencils, which was awesome for the kids. As for the rest, there is nothing spectacular but also there is nothing else you'd need. The breakfast option in the lobby level is great if you are traveling with kids. It has all the usual continental options as well as the hot (omelet, scrambled, bacon, etc...) as well as a good Japanese option. My kids loved the rice and miso soup for breakfast. 
The BAD - As SPG Gold, we get breakfast for two but they do charge about $20 USD for children 5 or older. That in my opinion was not worth it. But considering we were visiting with our friends, we paid it and enjoyed the breakfast. As an alternative, you can use their executive lounge for breakfast (executive level rooms or SPG member upgrade) and they will not charge you anything for you and your family. The other ""bad"" of the property was that the staff wasn't the usual level of enthusiasm or energy. They were cordial but not the ""i'll take care of everything"" mentality of other higher end hotels. The rooms also had a lot to be desired. While we were upgraded to a corner king, the normal standard room is quite small for a family of four. There are suites available at the hotel but based on the prices, i don't think they would be worth it. I would stick with getting a king and trying for an upgrade to the corner king.
The Ugly - well, there really wasn't anything there that constituted an ""ugly"" thing. I personally believe the decor was pretty bad and bordering ""ugly"" it does not rise to the level necessitating that connotation in this review. 
So, in short it's a great hotel for family stays but I wouldn't expect the level of detail oriented service you see at the Park Hyatt/Mandarin/Ritz/Conrad. But without such expectations, due to its location and convenience and the leisurely area surrounding the hotel, it is far better than trying your luck with Shinjuku area and having to deal with the mass of humanity that filter through that station as well as the nearby Shibuya station. I would stay clear of those two stations if you are with kids.",3,2016/05/16
2,REDACTED,en,3523,Rooms have great view. Hotel is five minutes walk from metro. And a station away from shibuya district. Excellent restaurants and bars. Across the road from a nice shopping g center and galleria. Some views offer a fantastic view if mount Fuji. Staff speaks decent English and is courteous and well trained. The tapanyikaki restaurant is really cool. The shuttle bus to airport costs 3500 yen per head and is slightly costly. But otherwise a great experience,5,2016/05/15
2,REDACTED,en,3524,"Had a wonderful stay at the Westin Tokyo! We stayed 7 nights during the Cherry Blossom Festival. I used the concierge to arrange my transport from the airport. The driver was waiting for me when I exited immigration. So my transfers were flawless. The staff at the front desk were very polite and informative. We were given a room on an upper floor. With views of the city. We even got to see Mt Fuji one morning. Our room was large and the bed was very comfortable. Tea and coffee makers are in the room for your convenience. We had the breakfast buffet every morning. What a treat! The selection and quality of the food is superb! I still miss having breakfast there!
I am a SPG Platinum member so we had access to the Club Lounge. If you wouldn't have access to the Club Lounge, I highly recommend booking a Club Floor room. We spent several nights relaxing there after long days of sightseeing. Continental breakfast in the morning. Tea and desserts are served in the afternoon. For 3 hours in the evening champagne, wine, brand name liquors, canapés, desserts, cheese and many other food items are served. The room has large windows and beautiful views of the city. 
The Westin is in a great location. Across the street from Yebisu Garden Place Shopping. This can all be accessed from the lower level of the hotel. You don't even need to walk outside. The train is also accessible through this same way. We walked to the river more than once to admire the cherry blossoms. The Westin was the perfect location for us during our Tokyo adventure. 
All the staff were very helpful and polite. No request was too large or too small. Even though this is a large hotel, we were treated like honored guests. On our last day there, we both felt sad we were leaving. We can't wait to go back!",5,2016/05/14

2,REDACTED,en,3527,"The hotel is far from all the historical sites and attractions but this is compensated by two facts. First there are a suburban train station and an underground station which can be reached in respectively five and ten minutes on a footway that is partly covered and some sections of it have a moving pavement. Second the hotel is located next to the Yebisu Garden Place where there are numerous shops and restaurants. 

The rooms are very spacious (which is rare in Japan, hence their high prices) and have all the possible amenities. It is also worth paying a little supplement to have a room in the higher floors with breathtaking view over the city with the Tokyo Tower and the Bay in the background. 

The hotel has several restaurants, which serve very high quality Japanese and Western food. The Yebisu Teppanyaki grill is a must and guests should not miss its gourmet dishes (meat and fish). The Mai Japanese restaurant serves very delicate sushi in a very cosy atmosphere: private tables separated by paper walls. However those who would just like to eat sushi could also go to the restaurants of Yebisu Garden Place where they can get them at a very advantageous price. 

The service is excellent and the personnel is very friendly with a rather good knowledge of the English language. In short, it was worthwhile paying a high price which was commensurate with the high quality of the services.",4,2016/05/12

The Hotel is located in a very nice part of the city on a JR line couple of stops from Shibuya and Harajuku. The staff is lovely and the hotel is really beautiful.

2,REDACTED,en,3534,"We stayed 2 nights here. Location-wise, the nearest train station is ""Ebisu"" and from there, expect to walk about 12 mins to the Westin (long moving walkways inside the station, followed by a long underpass to the hotel). In terms of amenities, there are lots of food and shopping options both within and around Ebisu station and the Westin so that's good. If you'd rather stay and eat at the Westin though, they have a good range of dining options, and I recommend the buffet breakfast at the hotel which offers an excellent variety of good quality food. The lounge is also worth checking out, as they offer a decent selection of finger food and imported and local alcohol. The room is really big by Japanese standards, although I've to say the furniture looks dated and in need of an update.

I think the only down side, and I am being picky here. It is expensive in an expensive city. I am not cheap but over $30 for a pretty average breakfast buffet is pushing the boat out a little. Even on the company card I slept better just going across the road to Starbucks. It's not city center but close to a metro and a main line station so getting around is easy from there..",4,2016/04/27
2,REDACTED,en,3536,"We recently stayed at the Westin Tokyo for 4 nights. It had an older decor and feel (not typical for a Westin), but the service and location were excellent. We had a corner king room and it was spacious, quiet and well appointed. The bathroom was beautiful with a tub, shower and of course, a Japanese toilet. The concierge was very attentive and provided great suggestions in terms of restaurants and directions. It was cheaper than a 5 star hotel, but we got 5 star service!

Here are a few things a few valuable things we learned:

1. Take Airport Limousine to/from Narita. It drops you off right at the hotel entrance. No need to transfer on the subway.
2. Easy to get to Ebisu station which was the station that we used to get around town. Covered walk with moving walkways through Yebisu Garden Place which keeps you out of any rain and makes a 20 minute walk only 5 minutes!",5,2016/04/26

2,REDACTED,en,3538,"I'm a fan of The Westin brand given their service and their beds :) 
The Westin Tokyo is not exception on those, exceptionally well catered for both the breakfast menus and the club lounge - you can enter if you're Starwood Gold and up I believe - with excellent food and great service.
Location is great, walking distance from Meguro station that can take you to the loop in downtown. Also, there are taxis always available - longest wait was probably 3 mins - so you don't have to worry about getting Uber (which doesn't work that great in Japan anyway). And if you get a room in a high floor with a city view you have a great view of Tokyo tower.
You have a small gym to workout well equipped and not too crowded but if you're a runner definitely go for a run outside, they have maps with a 3mi loop which is great, and of course you can borrow the gear with the pack light program.
My only comment is that this hotel doesn't look like a Westin but rather like a Ritz-Carlton, like a bit overloaded in decorations and not the sleek clean look of many Westins.
All around a great hotel for business, if you're for vaca the staff at the concierge was very helpful so you can plan there too.",4,2016/04/25
2,REDACTED,en,3539,"The best things about the hotel are
1. Proximity to all the great neighborhoods in Tokyo - almost every area (Shibuya, Harajuku, Roppongi, Shinagawa, Nakameguro etc) was about 10 to 15 min by taxi
2. Being right next to my favorite part of Tokyo which is Ebisu
3. Fantastic neighborhood with lots of cute restaurants and bars (it took me a few days to find them)
4. Next to a shopping area with great restaurants etc
5. People watching: being close to the train station and the mall made it a great place to watch people - lots of friendly people
6. People in Tokyo are fabulous (polite, respectful, nice etc)",4,2016/04/24
2,REDACTED,en,3540,"We were with a tour group when we arrived in March 2016. On our previous trip to Japan, we had purchased a print by Utagawa Hiroshige at a duty free in Narita Airport. We thought another complimentary print would make our display at home complete.The concierge Jiro Tsuge was already off duty when we approached him in the lobby as to where to purchase such a print at night. It was getting late, all the duty free stores were closed. He had to make several calls on our behalf. Finally, he confirmed for us our best chance for making the purchase was still the original duty free store tomorrow morning before we board our flight. His professionalism is exemplary to other concierges, Still thinking about his clients even when he was off the clock. I would go back to Westin Ebisu because I know Jiro is holding the fort. And we are going back in May and staying there 3 days because of him.",5,2016/04/23
2,REDACTED,en,3541,"It's a good Westin. Concierge helped us with some good restaurant recommendations, helped us with travel to our next hotel, and also helped us ship a little framed print we bought back to the states. Rooms are up to par. Is it the Park Hyatt? No. But it's not trying to be. And I much prefer the neighborhood, and it's less than half the price. Meets the expectations of an American style luxury hotel. Zero complaints. 

I want to spend more time talking about the neighborhood, Ebisu. Don't be fooled by the Meguro address. You will really want to spend your time in Ebisu. It's a great feel. Not too bustling but plenty of hip looking professionals (not the banker types you would see in Ginza) walking around during daytime work hours and fun bars at night. Lots of good food and so reasonably priced for such high quality. No use recommending restaurants. Just walk in anywhere. We stumbled into an Italian restaurant for lunch one day and it was all locals enjoying their lunch hour and super fresh tasty pasta and pizza. Special shout out to Ippudo ramen and Bikkuri sushi though. 

Pro tip: the Ebisu skywalk. Genius. Google maps might tell you you're equidistant between Meguro station and Ebisu station, but the Ebisu skywalk allows you to zoom to the station on moving walkways, directly to the East gate of the JR Ebisu station. We used the JR Yamanote line to experience other neighborhoods, and while we had fun taking in the bustle of for example Shinjuku station, Tokyo station, and the Shibuya crossing, we were so glad to come 'home' to our neighborhood each night where we could catch our breath. 

Few more pro tips for jet lagged Americans: Nothing opens until like 11am. We had breakfast at 7-eleven early when we couldn't sleep and went one morning to the Tsukiji fish market. International ATM located at the post office on the 3rd floor of the Yebisu garden complex. The Westin restaurant isn't bad (we had dinner there the first night because we were exhausted from travel and didn't want to go anywhere) but would recommend getting out as much as you can.",5,2016/04/22
2,REDACTED,en,3542,"From the moment we first entered the hotel to the moment we checked out, we loved everything about this Westin. Our flight to Tokyo from San Francisco was delayed for over 10 hours. Instead of getting into Tokyo at 1pm, we showed up at 10:30pm. When I approached the front desk, they were so genuinely sincere and polite, it was very refreshing, especially after a long day of flying and being stuck in an airport. Our room was wonderful. We loved everything about it. It was clean, comfortable, spacious, and relaxing. We were on the 21st floor with amazing view of Tokyo Tower. We controlled the temperature in our room which was very pleasant. We had access to the Club Lounge. The hotel gave us a choice of eating in the Club Lounge or restaurant on the 1st floor for breakfast. We chose the restaurant on the 1st floor every morning and loved it. There was a great selection of food and the juices were very tasty. My wife and two sons were in heaven. 

We were visiting Tokyo for Spring Break. So, we spent our days sight seeing. However, at the end of the day, we always looked forward to going back to our hotel room. It was like a quiet oasis in the middle of a huge, busy, noisy city. The walk from the metro or JR station is very easy, especially with the moving walkways. The entire walk was basically covered. It was not a hard or difficult walk. In fact, we left the hotel with our luggage walking to the metro. It was no big deal.

Even though we were on the 21st floor, we never had to wait more than 30 seconds for an elevator. The hotel was full, but it never felt like we were forgotten or just a number. Everyone at the hotel was very polite and always had a smile. With the hotel next to a department store, we would go down to the bottom floor a little before 7pm where they have a supermarket. Sushi and other items were on sale to sell immediately at the end of the day. It was a great way for my boys to enjoy an evening snack.

The Club Lounge was great. It always had drinks. A nice plus is also the soups during the afternoons. Most Club Lounges just have sodas during the afternoon, but this Westin had bacon vegetable, potato leak, or some other tasty soup available to snack on. Again, my sons were in heaven.

We loved everything about this hotel....the staff, the room, the lounge, the breakfast, and the location. We would head back to this hotel in a heartbeat. We would recommend this hotel to anyone including our friends and family members. It's truly a gem!!!",5,2016/04/22
2,REDACTED,en,3543,"I spent two weeks in the Westin Tokyo in March 2016. The hotel is an impressive size with all the facilities you would expect from a Westin (restaurants, bars and a gym). Breakfast at the main restaurant is excellent - a large buffet which, at the weekends, is popular with both locals and guests.
The staff are welcoming and always have a smile. Not only at the front desk, but all staff including cleaners and kitchen staff...quite refreshing for a big international hotel.
I chose the hotel, because of the Metro and JR Line stations nearby. Ebisu station is about 5 minutes walk away and can be reached under cover (handy for rainy Tokyo days). From here you can use the Metro or JR Line. I also used Meguro station, which is an easy 10 minute walk from the hotel, which gives you more access to the brilliant Tokyo rail network.
What was a nice surprise is the area that the hotel is located in. It is opposite the 'Ebisu Garden Place' which is a mall and restaurant area containing lots of Japanese and Western restaurants. A short walk through walk through Ebisu's pretty streets will take you down to the Meguro riverside walk (popular in cherry blossom season).
If I'm travelling back to Tokyo I'll definitely stay in this hotel again.",5,2016/04/21
2,REDACTED,en,3544,I stayed two nights at the Westin. It is close to the office I visit in Tokyo so this is really the best property to stay at in terms of proximity of work. I found my room to plain. The shower was okay but small. The breakfast is unimpressive for Asian standards (which are the best breakfast buffets in the world!). The real kicker was that I went to the gym around 5:30am (couldn't sleep) and the three treadmills and two ellipticals were already occupied. I remembered from a prior visit that they had provided a pass to the local health club so I could use the pool. I went downstairs and asked the front desk for a pass - they tried to charge me the equivalent of $27 USD for a day pass to this gym (the last time the pass was free but this was over two years ago). I am not so upset about them trying to charge me for the day pass as I am for the fact that their gym is so small within such a large hotel.,4,2016/04/21
2,REDACTED,en,3545,"This is certainly a very good hotel . Nice location in Ebisu with lot of restaurants , mall , Ebisu beer museum & Ebisu tower around . station just on a walking distance - probably 5-8 mints max . Meguro river is close by which had a nice walking/jogging track alongside the river , with cherry blossom trees on both sides !! 
we got room with tree tower which looks great in the night when illuminated .
the Hotel staff was excellent , had a quick checkin on both my visits . the express counter service staff was really good & helpful too. the person who came to drop my luggage on my first visit was really efficient & polite , so him many times on this counter next to the lobby door inside the lobby , guess his name was John , not sure . he did give excellent service whenever i asked for anything . he was good in remembering guest names too , would always address me with my last name . overall very good stay . definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting Tokyo .",4,2016/04/20
2,REDACTED,en,3546,"just completed a stay here and quite disappointed in the experience from when I was here last about 18 months ago. Reception at check in was very cold and not welcoming at all, likewise when I tried to use concierge the lady seemed put out that she needed to help me. The one positive is the staff in club lounge continue to be great although if you want a seat during cocktail hour make sure you are there before start time at 5.30pm otherwise you'll be standing and feeling very awkward. 

Made my reservation on the basis of club room access to a very good out sourced gym (the one in hotel is tiny), which was confirmed at time of booking. When arrived at hotel was told this relationship had ceased and if I wanted to use the gym it would cost me 3,500 yen each visit. No apology offered or given the circumstance exception was made.... again thought very bad service.

Breakfast was noticeably poorer from previous visit. I have just completed stays at Westins in Cape Town and Bangkok and with these hotels charging half the room rate of Westin Tokyo they provide a breakfast that puts Tokyo to shame. In the end we stopped going to breakfast because it was so average.

I don't think we will be coming back to this hotel as for the rate they charge can easily find somewhere elsewhere who will value our business more.",3,2016/04/19
2,REDACTED,en,3547,"This is the fourth time we stayed at The Westin Ebisu! 
It's a great hotel without doubt - everything you can expect from a Westin standard!
The hotel is link to the Ebisu train station - although it's a bit of walk from the hotel to the station!
Will definitely stay here again when we are back in Tokyo!",5,2016/04/18
2,REDACTED,en,3548,"The hotel is awesome. Anything you can expect from a Westin, it's there. The only thing is the location. Even it's a short walk to the JR entrance, but still a 15 minute walk from the actual JR track. With a baby with us, the walk is much further than it sounds. But overall is a good experience.",5,2016/04/10
2,REDACTED,en,3549,"As far as the hotel goes, it's perfect. Perfect location, close to Shibuya and walking distance from lots of restaurants and mall.

As far as food, restaurants and their quality and prices, that's another review......",5,2016/04/10
2,REDACTED,en,3550,"Business trip to Tokyo, stayed for three nights. Hotel is far from the hotel, but quite conveniently connected to the train station and the malls and CBD is quite close. Rooms were pretty big compared to Tokyo standard. Good rooms with not so bad breakfast range. Hotel staff were pretty friendly and helpful. Surprisingly room service food was not bad.",4,2016/04/07
2,REDACTED,en,3551,"I recently stayed at the Westin Tokyo for three nights. When booking The Westin I was looking for a hotel that was reasonably close to the centre of Tokyo but not to over the top expensive.

The rooms are very nice and large for Japan. Bed was comfortable but we had to ask for firmer pillows as the provided ones did not provide much neck support.

The breakfast buffet in the lobby was a great mix of western, Asian and Japanese options. There is a great teppanyaki restaurant on the 22nd floor, a little expensive but high quality food.

The hotel is close to the Ebisu metro station, a 5-8 minute walk from the hotel. From the Ebisu station it is a 15 minute train ride toTokyo station. Across the road from The Westin is a small mall with cafes and restaurants, a Burger King and a pharmacy.",5,2016/04/06
2,REDACTED,en,3552,"We stayed at the Westin Tokyo based on using our SPG points as well as recommendation from our travel agent. The location was great, the Ebisu station is within walking distance as well as a Starbucks and a french bakery. It is in a quiet part of Tokyo which I appreciated as it was nice to get away from the madness a bit when we were done sightseeing. The station has plently of restaturant choices and is very clean and modern. The hotel while dated as noted by other travelers is clean and well appointed. The staff was excellent and professional. The rooms were large, bathrooms large, hotel clean. They even had a curling iron that I could borrow.
I did not try the gym or the breakfast. The bar is lovely, served tasty drinks and had a nice view of the garden. We felt very safe walking around the hotel at night-though Japan overall appears to be very safe. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone and would be happy to come back",5,2016/04/04
2,REDACTED,en,3553,"Since it was our first visit to Tokyo, we didn't realize what a great location Westin has. After 3 days of touring the city, we feel like Ebisu area is our favorite area. The rooms are very nice and elegant. It definitely has an old school Western ambiance. New Westin's in other parts of the world have a more contemporary decor, so you feel like you step back in time a decade or two when you visit this location. The only reason that I didn't give them 5 stars is that there were a few minor glitches in service. Repeated problems with our room keys and breakfast service every morning was substandard (unorganized and slightly chaotic given the volume). You won't be disappointed if you stay here.",4,2016/04/02
2,REDACTED,en,3554,"Located in Ebisu, the hotel is located in a quiet part of tokyo, just one station from shibuya station. The rooms are very spacious (despite a standard room), compared to most Japanese hotels. Across from it, there's a large dept. store (mitsukoshi) with lots of restaurants (ebisu garden). The staffs are very friendly, trying to accomodate all my every needs. Easy transportation to and from airports since there is a shuttle bus",5,2016/04/02
2,REDACTED,en,3555,"This Hotel is located in Ebisu which is 1 train stop away to Shibuya.. It is very convince. The Ebisu JR station is about 8-10 minutes walk but you went through stores and walkaway so you barely realise it took that long. 
The Hotel is very beautiful. The lobby is very nice and grand. We booked the room with the lounge privileged. The room is big even for regular standard not only Japanese standard. The bathroom also very nice with separate bath and shower. They give you bath salt that smell very nice. The water pressure and the warmness of the water also great. The air conditioning works perfectly and gets very cold (some hotel in Japan control their Air Conditioner so it can't go below some point and it is a big deal for me to have cold room). The lounge is very nice. They offer you free drink at night and the food selection also good. We also tried the gym. So Westin has 2 gym. One is in the hotel itself and the other on is in the mall that connected to the hotel. The gym called Grancise if Im not mistaken. Because i pick the club room i got privilege to go to Grancise. The gym in Westin is ok, few equipment, nothing really special. The Grancise one is really nice though. They have the golf simulator, indoor pool, weights, equipments, cardio. So that was really cool. Only just to remind some people. They have a very strict non tattoo rule in Japan for gym and sauna. My husband has tattoo but he is able to cover it up with long sleeve when working out... still its weird for them to have that rule. 
As for breakfast. It is pretty complete... I have to say that i have been to other Westin hotel that offer better breakfast though (Westin Kuala Lumpur). But this one is pretty good. Only on the second night. The morning we check out... Take them so long to sit us out even though it is empty inside... i think they need better system to sit down people for breakfast. 
Other than that I'm very happy with my choice of hotel while I'm in tokyo and i will be staying here again if i come back.
I highly recommended you get the club room...

The hotel is very close to the Ebisu train stop(walking distance). Lobby is gorgeous and people working there were very nice. We were lucky enough to be able to go to executive lounge at HH and we ended up getting enough to eat there that we didn't have to go for dinner. Breakfast buffet the next day was very good with a large variety of foods to eat. The hotel even offers umbrellas for guests to borrow which was helpful in March since it is very rainy in the spring.,5,2016/03/28
2,REDACTED,en,3559,"I was a little worried with some of the reviews, stating small rooms, etc. Room was great, I thought I would have to get a roll away bed for my teenager, but the beds in the room slept 3 comfortably. They are smaller than the Westin beds in the U.S. The hotel is beautiful, the service was excellent, prompt and friendly. Accommodated all of my requests: confirming day trips, booking return bus to the airport, helping with directions, have us copies of maps to our destinations, wifi in room, and borrowed a curling iron. 
They don't have a pool, but you can have access to one that is very close. Many shops and restaurants within walking distance (across the street-you can take the escalator down a floor and find and underground path there). The city is lovely and the hotel was a nice treat!",5,2016/03/25
2,REDACTED,en,3560,"I stayed in this hotel dozens of times in 2015-2016 (most recently March 2016) and I am rarely satisfied. The Sheraton, while not quite as nice, is a much better value (usually half the price) for SPG points hound like myself. 

Notable shortcomings:
Almost no recognition of status and loyalty. I stayed here over 130 nights from May 2015-March 2016 and still have to beg for upgrades when the hotel is obviously not full.

Lounge amenities are poor - No hot food during the day, and none of the better breakfast options offered in the main restaurant.

Limited in-lobby seating - This hotel has fallen victim to the greedy hotel trend of replacing open seating with table-service seating. I always see old people in pain standing around because there isn't anywhere for them to sit in a lobby(!).

Business center: Literally doesn't work. I have tried to print 3x and never worked because the printer was broke. And then the concierge desk gives me trouble when I ask them to print.

Check-in: Very slow, especially since I have checked-in almost 50 times here. Always takes 10 minutes and they read through the same script etc.

Bottom line: The main business of this hotel is Japanese weddings. Anything else is secondary.",2,2016/03/23

Just a little bit of a hike each time you head to the subway station - especially with luggage and tired feet!",5,2016/03/21

The hotel is on the border of a nice peaceful park and close to Ebisu station, with the always conveinent Yamanoto Line and few others, and close with all its shops and eateries of the Ebisu area. And is even at a walkable distance from Shibuya, should you feel like exploring Tokyo on your feet.
The hotel itself is fanststic: my room was large and overlooking the park. The staff and overall the service is always top-notch and on the top floor there is a great bar with live Jazz most of the nights, for a relaxing drink while overlooking all the lights of Tokyo's skiline.",5,2016/03/21
2,REDACTED,en,3563,"I've been here for 12 days and have 5 left, and overall I'm happy with my choice of this hotel, Westin standards for the most part. The rooms are huge and so are the bathrooms, lots of closet space, a shower and a large bath. It location is really ideal, especially for such a long trip. The Ebisu station is a 5 minute walk, and can be done completely underground if the weather is bad. There are a lot of really great restaurants across the street from the hotel, a grocery store, multiple coffee shops and a Michelin star restaurant. The gym at the Westin is pretty decent, it’s something that’s important to me and I couldn’t get a grasp on what it was like before I got here…but anyone else concerned about the facility, it has; treadmills, stairmasters, elipticals, bikes, free weights, medicine balls, weight machines and lots of other little things. It was a pleasant surprise. I got a massage today at the Spa, and although very overpriced (as per usual at the Westin) it was great. The Spa had a steam room, whirlpool, showers and lots of nice facial products for use. My only complaint about the Spa is that to use the facilities without a service costs 2000 yen…I’ve visited many other Westins where the use of the steam room and sauna are generally free, so this is a shame.
My only other real complaint about this hotel is The Terrace restaurant. The lunch and dinner buffet is “USA buffet” theme and it’s just terrible. It’s too bad because usually after a long day of work I like to hit up the buffet but I can’t handle it here. It’s a hack job on “USA” food, which isn’t good to begin with and I forced myself to try it twice and both times was so disappointed. The other restaurants in the hotel are super expensive and not worth the cost, but not bad options if you’re tired and hungry. Especially Mai, the sushi is good but not worth the cost. But again, the food’s not a huge issue because there are so many options across the street and in the subway station.",4,2016/03/19
2,REDACTED,en,3564,"This hotel is very much in keeping with the usual Westin standards. Good service and excellent concierge. The decor is slightly dated and on the weekends, the hotel can be crowded as it is a popular wedding venue. Ebisu itself is not a great place to visit but the train station is so close to Ebisu station, you can take a train to pretty much anywhere in Tokyo.

2,REDACTED,en,3571,"PROS:
-Lovely spacious hotel
-Clean, well kept rooms
-Great location (nearby is = Shibuya/Shinjuku/Roppongi)
-As a westerner, the hotel feels like home b/c of the Yebisu area: western architecture compared to the other neighborhoods...also lots of shops, restaurants, and places to get a drink or coffee with English speakers & menus 
-Only a 12 min walk to Ebisu Station (could also mean a long walk for others esp how I was there in the summer but if you are young you should have NO EXCUSE)
-Not far from HANEDA airport (took a taxi for $60)

CONS:
-The hotel staff was not very 'hospitable' my encounters with front desk staff checking in/out and asking questions about the area was very bland (did not feel welcoming esp, as a first and last impression of Japan) 
-We asked the doorman for an umbrella since it was raining and he just pointed at a bunch of umbrellas that were LOCKED then ran off (it would've been nice if he just handed us over an umbrella) 
-Asked another doorman for an umbrella since the other 1 was NO HELP and finally he got one but did not say a WORD after we said ARIGATO GOZAIMASU
-Basically the Japanese people I encountered throughout my trip on the streets were even more hospitable than the people in this hotel

Overall the hotel was nice, clean, conveniently located --- can't complain about that. But wouldn't stay again b/c I'm big on service which is why I took off 1 star. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends & family just that service tid bit though needs to be worked on.",4,2016/02/16

Easy 10 min walk from Ebisu station with lots of places to eat and shop nearby as well. What I like most is the service. While true service is almost always great in Japan, the Westin stands out even in this service oriented country. On more than one occasion they have gone out of their way to accommodate special requests and always find a solution to any issues that come up. The views of Tokyo are fantastic too. I would give them 6 stars if I could.",5,2016/02/10

* The rooms are very nice with a lovely view of the city.
* The executive lounge is large with a good selection of food and beverages. The staff is responsive.

The Bad:
No recognition as an SPG Platinum member.

There was an ample mini bar and tea/coffee making facilities, a must for the weary business traveler. I stayed for 2 nights and the staff there were so helpful. My every wish was catered for, and would you believe as a smoker I was able to sit in a very luxurious bar looking out on to a beautiful garden while enjoying a coffee and a cigarette. Its the little things like this when you are so far from home that make a stay in a hotel feel like home. Well done Westin, I wont be staying anywhere else in Tokyo when I return.",5,2016/02/07
2,REDACTED,en,3575,"I stay about 100 nights per year in SPG hotels and this is the bottom on my list. Except for the guys working the door EVERYONE in this hotel is rude. The accommodations look like my grandmothers house 20 years ago. The location is good, but it does not make up for the terrible service.",2,2016/02/06
2,REDACTED,en,3576,"The Absolute Beauty, Serenity and Convenience of this Hotel was an unexpected Surprise. The lobby is stunning and the rooms, which are quite large for Tokyo, were very comfortable. The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood and I was worried that it was too far away from the subway and center of town. I needn't have worried. There is a direct path (mostly covered) to the Subway station that passes through a new mall. The mall has lots of shops and, on the lower level, many restaurants to choose from. It was rainy when we were there but the front desk showed us a side door that takes you through a lower level of the mall to the subway so that you are covered from the elements. There are MANY weddings here so the lobby can get congested at times. All in all the Westin Tokyo was a beautiful surprise that I would eagerly make my home base on my next trip to Tokyo.",5,2016/02/05
2,REDACTED,en,3577,"We recently stated at the Westin Hotel in Tokyo and loved it. The hotel is very beautiful, a lovely location and near the subway to take you anywhere you want to go to in Tokyo. The breakfast buffet is great as was the service from concierge desk, especially Eloisa. Our room was beautifully appointed with a nice teapot and wonderful teas to enjoy. We had an amazing view of the city and we were very close to many good restaurants. We would stay here again. I just wish there was a hotel pool to enjoy.",5,2016/02/03
2,REDACTED,en,3578,"We were concerned when we caught a taxi from the train station and the driver had to pull out a UBD to find it. The drive there made us more nervous until we turned a corner and saw the Westin. It was gorgeous. The room was huge....about 5 times the size of our Kyoto hotel. The buffet restaurant was excellent, as was the sushi restaurant although both were expensive. Shopping centres and restaurants across the road so very handy. Would definitely go back. Highly recommended",5,2016/01/28
2,REDACTED,en,3579,"It was a quick 2 night stay. Room was generous in space and the decor is pretty standard. I was able to workout in the room by moving the coffee table, instead of going to the gym. Efficient and friendly check in and check out. Ordered room service. Delivery was quick and food was fine. Very friendly and courteous staff throughout the hotel.",4,2016/01/26
2,REDACTED,en,3580,"I joined my husband who was traveling for business. The rooms are well designed and comfortable. Their compact bathrooms are great! For a very busy hotel the service still had a personal touch. We enjoyed the selection and quality of the food at breakfast. The take-away shop from Victor's, the French restaurant, was a great surprise.",3,2016/01/24
2,REDACTED,en,3581,"I had stayed 5 nights during my virgin trip to tokyo and had loved every second of it staying with Westin. Arrived in the morning at about 9am and was granted early check in. The gentleman who checked us in is simply professional.

Room is huge despite having 2 super single beds. Spacious and clean. Theme of the hotel leans heavily towards European flair. Bathroom is huge and amenities fully stocked.

Location is superb with the Ebisu Station just a mere 5 to 7 mins walk away. Convenience store just across the road before the entrance to the travelator leading to train station. Just convenient.

Services from the Concierge never fail. A huge thank you to Ms Tomoko Asano-Westin Experiences Specialist, Ms Etsuko Nakagawa-Concierge and the rest of the team for making my 5 nights the best time of my life. Arigato.

2,REDACTED,en,3582,"I would not stay here again.

Nice location, very nice rooms, but the rooms are loud. I switched rooms once because the first room was so loud. The second room was not better.

Service is very pleasant but not necessarily helpful. 

Restaurant is painfully slow. Breakfast is included with most rooms. It is buffet style and has plenty of options. But getting a cup of coffee takes 20 minutes, every morning. Doesn't matter if it is busy or slow. I frequently had finished breakfast and was still waiting for coffee.",3,2016/01/18
2,REDACTED,en,3583,"I very nice hotel with the normal Westin standards you would expect from this hotel chain. The breakfast is great even a little overwhelming. The Internet was a bit pricey in the rooms especially after you paid $330 per night for a two week stay, but I guess that comes with luxury. Otherwise the hotel had a great location, next to the yebisu beer museum!",5,2016/01/17
2,REDACTED,en,3584,"The service and food are excellent, and the lobby, guest rooms and lounges are beautiful at this Ebisu hotel. It is away from the most congested part of Tokyo, yet there are two train stations within an easy walking distance (which give you access to any part of the city), as well as many shops and good restaurants. 

The hotel is modern, immaculately clean and well maintained, as you would expect in Japan. Everyone at the concierge desk was exceptionally helpful in making reservations and helping us find our way to our desired destinations.

Highly recommended and we would not hesitate to stay here again for business or pleasure!",5,2016/01/14
2,REDACTED,en,3585,We made a quick trip to Tokyo for business and this hotel made us feel just like we were still in America with large rooms and king size bed. The views from the room were great. On the last day we could even see Mt. Fuji in the distance. The rooms are quiet and very accommodating. We had the buffet off the main entrance and it was okay. The other restaurants are fairly expensive in the hotel. We enjoyed our time there.,4,2016/01/14
2,REDACTED,en,3586,"This hotel is not centrally located, but it’s within walking distance to the JR Ebisu station, so we were able to travel around Tokyo without any issues. You stay at this hotel mainly for the service. We felt so welcome and appreciated and we loved our room. We upgraded to an Executive Club Room and the hotel was kind enough to give us a corner suite with a fantastic view of the Tokyo Tower. The Concierge staff was wonderful!!! They helped us make dinner reservations and mapped things out for us. This was our second visit to Tokyo, but traveling around the city was still a bit confusing, especially because we don’t speak any Japanese. It was nice to have someone explain things well to us. We didn’t get lost once thanks to them. :) We enjoyed everything about this hotel. They were beautifully decorated for Christmas, which made everything extra special. The Westin never disappoints. Thank you for such a wonderful stay!",5,2016/01/13
2,REDACTED,en,3587,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our 4 nights at the Westin. Our room was not extra large but I guess that space in Tokyo is at a premium, and it still had anything we needed and more, plus a nice view. Great happy hour in the lounge to decompress after long days of sightseeing and very good breakfasts in the main restaurants.
The concierge team was very helpful in making restaurant reservations for us.
The hotel is less than 10 minutes walk from several trains, plus the walk is through a shopping mall in case you want to do some shopping or grab some food from yet another great department store food court...
The only slight negative was the cigarette smoke in the hallway from our room to the elevator. It was unpleasant for 2 non-smokers but it didn't make it to our room so it wasn't a big deal.
We would definitely stay again if/when we're back in Tokyo.",5,2016/01/13
2,REDACTED,en,3588,"Very nice hotel in a very nice, quiet part of the city, close to the Yebisu complex and station. Very good breakfast, nice restaurants, everything you expect from a good Westin. The missing link? The concierge who promised to organise a private tour of the city and simply did not leave a message, left for the holidays and was nowhere to be seen in the next few days. Apart from that, a very nice alternative for Tokyo.",4,2016/01/07
2,REDACTED,en,3589,The hotel is conveniently located near a mall with plenty of dining options. It is a bit of a walk from the train station but there are plenty of things to eat near the train station as well. There is a covered travellator from the station to the hotel so it makes the distance seem much shorter.,4,2016/01/05
2,REDACTED,en,3590,"The rooms are a little older then some other hotels, but they are well designed, nice views, and everything you need to get some work done. 

The location is good, not too far to travel to get to major areas. The train is about 7-10 mins walk, but most of it is undercover. 

Good restaurants in the area, all walking distance. 

BTW if it is raining and you need a taxi in the morning, get down to the lobby before 8.30am, I've been caught in a few long queues.",4,2016/01/05
2,REDACTED,en,3591,"The lobby and staff are top notch. Everyone is friendly. The front desk staff are all smiling and happy to help. But the location is a bit of a hike from Ebisu Station. Not terrible, but at a good clip it's still a 10-15 minute walk.

We were on the 14th floor and had a fantastic view of the Southwest. On a clear day we even saw Mt Fuji perfectly.

The Starwood club had views of Tokyo Tower and the breakfast buffet was perfect. Not huge, but exactly what we wanted featuring both eastern and western options.

I've stayed in my fair share of Starwood properties and this is definitely on the upper end.",4,2016/01/04
2,REDACTED,en,3592,"Finally reviewing after visiting in 2010. We stayed on the executive floor due to our points status. The room amenities were great - brushes and toothbrushes in the washroom, slippers and traditional robes. The executive lounge provided breakfast and a great cappuccino machine - we consumed far too much caffeine! The evening appetizers and drinks were top notch. The service at this hotel is the best we've ever experienced.",5,2016/01/04
2,REDACTED,en,3593,"As one accustomed to Westins in the US, the Westin Tokyo was a pleasant upgrade. It may have helped that I am SPG Gold, but my daughter and I had a spacious, clean room with a view of Mount Fuji and the City of Tokyo. Bathroom spacious and clean. The staff was extremely attentive. The gym was small (and if we went early it was crowded, with steamed-up windows), but when not overly-busy it was perfectly adequate and offered a good view through a wall of windows. No pool. The lobby was beautifully decorated for Christmas, and has a lounge for tea/dessert/after dinner drinks, plus a regular bar and a casual restaurant on the first floor. The top floor has another bar (extremely full of cigarette smoke the night we attempted), a Japanese restaurant, and a French restaurant. We had a good experience one night at the Japanese restaurant sushi bar -- even though I felt sort of guilty for eating in the hotel, it is not the same experience as in the US. The sushi chef was fun to interact with, and everyone else in the place was Japanese.

The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to the Ebisu station, where you can access both the subway and JR Tokyo lines. En route, you pass a branch of the Mitsukoshi department store, if you're having a luxury brands jones, as well as a Dean & Deluca in case you just can't stand another morning without a good old US-style muffin. However, speaking of breakfast, the buffet at the Westin is outstanding, with a wide offering of Japanese and Western foods. It's a little expensive at Y3500 per person, but if you buy your tickets at check-in they will charge you less. The last day we were there, we had to deal with a line, but that was Dec 30 -- getting into New Year's holiday.",5,2016/01/03
2,REDACTED,en,3594,"Hotel was lovely. A very interesting pseudo-European style with lots of gold decorations. Staff was incredible. I've come to expect that in Japan but they were super friendly and helpful. Maid service was exceptional. 
Breakfast was fantastic. However if you go down past 8am it is pretty common to have to wait. Although I was only there for 4 days, so maybe it was specific to my experience. 
Didn't have a chance to go to they gym. 
Didn't use the wifi because I rented a pocket wifi and picked it up at the post office at the airport. This was SO helpful and I would recommend to anyone visiting.",4,2016/01/03
2,REDACTED,en,3595,"Stayed for a few days before Christmas. 

The hotel itself is lovely. Modern and clean, the rooms are thoughtfully designed and I had a great view of the park and Tokyo Tower. 

The room was SERIOUSLY quiet. I never heard noise in the hall or from the rooms next door. There is a building under construction next door and even that wasn't very loud. It seemed to start at 9 am and end by 5 pm. 

A lot of reviews here mention how quiet the neighborhood is, and how easily accessible the train is. I didn't realize it's a completely covered 7-8 minute walk, so if it's raining, you can get to the JR and the Metro without being outside. 

The reviews don't seem to highlight all the restaurants next door. Probably about 20 of them, from Starbucks all the way to casual places and fancy places. Plus the food hall in the basement of Mitsukoshi next door. (Also accessible underground.)

There's also a really good wine store just past the hotel exit on the basement level. 

The food in the Westin was pretty good too. The breakfast buffet was really good, and the service was efficient and friendly. I also ate at the teppanyaki place on the top floor, which was very good. And yes, a bit expensive but not outrageous. 

Most important to note - the service From check in to the concierge to the bellmen. Even the housekeeping staff. Everyone was very friendly, nice, and eager to help. 

I was expecting the normal Westin experience - good but nothing special. This hotel is really special. 

I'd stay again without a doubt.",5,2016/01/03
2,REDACTED,en,3596,"This was my first time staying in SPG hotel in Tokyo area (I stay in Kansai area more previously), from the map it looks quite far away from JR Ebisu station but checking on other internet forum I found that most of the time there are moving pathway in the building between to shorten the walking time, so I usually can walk within 10mins between hotel and JR.

Hotel has a good view, unfortunately there is another tall building in front of hotel blocking some of the nice view. Surprisingly hotel staff told me that they can offer me free tickets to the observatory deck of that building in front of hotel because I am SPG Platinum member, wow!

I went with friends, some of them were first time visiting Japan, I expected that they will be buying lots of stuff, the room was spacious so it's never a problem for us. (One thing I do not understand, why they never offer suite to SPG platinum member when there is availability? Otherwise the room would be even bigger!)

Club lounge is providing snacks all the times, with evening cocktail section we can go for a drink after coming back from shopping session, which is nice!

Staff was helpful, I stayed behind and planned to visit other perfecture of Japan, they helped me to do lots of translations when I have difficulty on some reservations, appreciate their help! I would definitely come back another time.",4,2016/01/03
2,REDACTED,en,3597,"Westin is one of my regular picks and that was exceptionally true for Tokyo after experience with some poor hotel accomodation alternatives. Spacy rooms and bathrooms with careful service, several good clean non-smoking restaurants and bars in house, friendly barman. Next by huge Shopping Mall and Ebisu Garde Place with numerous shops and restaurants. Easy access to Tokyo subway makes the life easier in crowded city as well. Two famiIies have returned to Westin for another few days due to the appreciation.",5,2016/01/03
2,REDACTED,en,3598,"Staying at the Westin Tokyo was a great decision. The hotel has nice and expected Westin decor, not too worn out . Big rooms, good bathrooms and correct amenities. The breakfast is very good and the personnel has been extremely pleasant and flexible to accomodate the 4 of us on the very busy times during the Holidays. 
The location is big benefit and there are so many options of restaurants on walking distance. The proximity to a train station is also a plus. 
It was my first time out of the busy areas of Tokyo and I loved it.",4,2015/12/30
2,REDACTED,en,3599,"My family of four stayed for four nights in two connecting Deluxe rooms, wrapping up a two week trip to Japan. The rooms, while not the newest, appeared luxurious after the cubicles we had in Furano's Naturwald Hotel (ok, so skiers don't care much about the sleeping arrangements). As this was my second stay at this Westin (the first for my wife and boys), I looked beyond the unfashionable decor to the service details and came away rather impressed. Here's a sampling. 1. The bath gels, bathrobes, coffee powder were faithfully replaced each day without fail. I have stayed in similar 5 star properties which needed reminders for refills or simply stinted. 2. It has managed to stay efficient despite its size and guest turnover. The concierge was earnest; bell hops were always on time; the concierge attended to my wife's requests for hair dressing appointments; checkout was smooth. Overall, you pay for the good service -- and the benefit of Ebisu Garden Place across the road with its many yummy restaurants and sheltered walkway to the subway station.",4,2015/12/28
2,REDACTED,en,3600,Great hotel with excellent care for customers and details. Buffet dinner is well organized with excellent quality and same is true for breakfast. Major area of improvement is management of bookings; when a regular client wants to come back it should be made simpler for him to find a room.,5,2015/12/27
2,REDACTED,en,3601,"The hotel service is much much better than hotels I have stayed in Tokyo. The rooms are quite outdated though, and in summer the aircon isn't cooling enough. However, the staff go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and I have stayed almost 30 nights this year, and I would recommend staying here, if you don't mind small things like no plug by the bedside and decor that is outdated. The service and it being not such a big hotel, the service is much better than other international chains I've stayed at in Shinjuku.",5,2015/12/27
2,REDACTED,en,3602,"Stayed here for the 1st time. It's a bit of a walk from the ebisu JR station, about 20 min. But once on the JR line, it's convenient to get to Tokyo, shibuya, shinjuku and ueno stations 

When I arrived by cab, there was no doorman nor porter to help with my luggage. The lobby is ""classical"" style, or just a bit old

The room looks oldish too, but luckily there is a shower cubicle and not just the safety hazard tub

Didn't get to try the gym

Breakfast in the lounge was ok

",4,2015/12/26
2,REDACTED,en,3603,The Westin was absolutely gorgeous during the holiday season. It could not have been decorated better. My only complaint about the holidays was the restaurants didn't keep a few reservation times available for hotel guests coming in. We didn't realise the time of year was such a big dating game and all the eateries were not available. We were disappointed Ad spg members and had multiple hotel rooms. Clean rooms. Good service. Food in the executive lounge was sparse. We had to wait more than once for them to fill things up.,4,2015/12/26
2,REDACTED,en,3604,"I stayed here before, it was very good then, with a few flaws, they have more than caught up with those. This stay was as close to perfection as any hotel manager can hope to get. All my needs were not only serviced, but anticipated, great service with as small, efficiency from reservation to check in to check out. One of those occasions when time goes much to fast. 
The first gold medal for Japan has been achieved. Sublime",5,2015/12/23
2,REDACTED,en,3605,"Westin Tokyo was perfectly located in one of the nice neighborhoods of Tokyo and walking distance to Ebisu station. My room was on 23rd floor with beautiful city views, including Tokyo Tower and Roppingi Hills Mori Tower. During my stay, I had dinner at Yebisu (Teppanyaki grill - based on reviews online) one night. The price maybe a little high but the food was amazing! I am a Gold SPG member and I should say, I was truly pleased with service, food, staff.",5,2015/12/22
2,REDACTED,en,3606,"Not really in a super hype area, the hotel is an a rather green, quiet area in the center of Tokyo (Ebisu park). However, it's just about 5-10 minutes to the Ebisu train situation, from which you can be in 10 minutes in Shibuya or 15 in Harujuku. So all, good. 

It's a Super Classical: architecture, rooms, bathrooms, furniture, services, everything.... So at the end it does the job of a good hotel, but you won't leave with that feeling of ""experience"" that you have in other, newer properties.

Rooms are rather generous in size. Mine unfortunately was smelling smoke and I hesitated to change it, before actually being able to open the window for some hours and get rid of it upon by return. I liked the bathroom, again super classical, but clean and spacious.

Although good, you won't find breakfast (pricey) exceptional, especially if you like continental breakfast.

Last comment I would like to make is about the lounge on the top floor. I had dinner with a friend there, and there was simply nobody. Did not have a good feeling.

Overall recommended, but it's definitely worth to consider other locations at similar prices, unfortunately not SPG properties. For instance, the Cerulean Toyku Tower (right in the middle of Shibuya).",4,2015/12/22
2,REDACTED,en,3607,"A view from an 11 year old, hmmmmm let's see....
the Westin in Tokyo was more than great. It was amazing, the food, the service, the rooms were all fabulous. It wasn't just a normal starwood hotel, this was probably one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. There's nothing bad about it.

Outside of the hotel there is a beautiful Japanese garden. I loved to take photos of all the different trees and plants. Also in the executive lounge every night there is dinner from a different nationality which is always very yummy.

Don't Miss Out!!!!",5,2015/12/17
2,REDACTED,en,3608,"We stayed in a wheelchair accessible room with a roll in shower. The room had everything we needed and the hotel staff were brilliant.
We caught the train from Narita Airport to Ebisu. Our 2 daughters are permanent wheelchair users, the Japanese rail system is amazing, totally wheelchair accessible and the fastest way to go. When you buy a ticket the station staff escort you to your train, put on the white gloves, get out the ramp help you onto the train, bow and ensure that you are met at any transfer station and at the end of your journey.
The walk from Ebisu station to the Westin is virtually flat and even pushing wheelchairs took us less than 10 minutes.
We found that everywhere we went Japanese people wanted to help.
Loved Japan, the Westin is a great place to stay to see Tokyo.",5,2015/12/15
2,REDACTED,en,3609,"Our party of 3 recently stayed at the Westin Tokyo for 5 nights.

The whole experience from checkin to checkout was flawless and the service during our stay was sensational.

We stayed in a suite, which was enormous in size and very well appointed. The club lounge was a wonderful inclusion in our package, offering wine, spirits and soft drinks for 2 hours each night with substantial canapés.

The staff in the club loung were amazing, answering our various questions and seeking answers for us about rail tickets, museum entry etc. 

We were incredibly impressed with the fact that everyone seemed to have a smile in their face all of the time.

The closest JR Train station is Ebisu, which is connected to the hotel by undercover walkways. It is a brisk 10 minute walk with moving sidewalks which make the walk easy. The metro stop is just outside the West exit of Ebisu JR. station.

We had a fantastic time in Tokyo and will definitely be back.",5,2015/12/14

We'll definitely stay here again the next time we're in Tokyo but I just wish it was a tad bit closer to the metro station!! It was a straight easy walk but long, at least 15-20 mins walk. Kinda tiring after a day out!

2,REDACTED,en,3612,Stayed 2 nights at the Westin Tokyo which is just across the street from the Yebisu Garden Palace. This was the former site for the famous Yebisu beer. The service was top class and the room has a fantastic view of Tokyo Tower and the rest of the city. The check in process was the smoothest I have experienced. The club lounge has great snacks and Yebisu beer (of course!). I went to the Yebisu Grill for dinner on my 2nd night. A memorable experience. The premium wagyu with garlic chips is a must. Simply melt-in-your-mouth experience that only premium wagyu can deliver. Overall a memorable stay. a truly 5* experience.,5,2015/12/11
2,REDACTED,en,3613,the rooms are large and beautifully appointed. The lobby is grand and we saw multiple weddings in progress. The lounge on 17 served a complete breakfast that was delicious.

2,REDACTED,en,3614,"I love this hotel. I stay here almost every time I am in Tokyo... The decor is a Japanese interpretation of the American take on classical European design. Lots of wood and warmth and a really great Xmas tree. Check-in is always efficient and friendly. The concierge is quite amazing - they will really go the extra mile to sort out your reservations at restaurants and events before you arrive.

Rooms are large - especially by Tokyo standards - and spotlessly clean. The beds are nice and comfortable. Wifi is fast and reliable.

Good access to public transport. Both Ebisu and Meguro stations are 10 minutes' walk away - both are major stations on the subway network with access to multiple lines - including the all-important Yamanote line. There is covered access to a shops and restaurants from the basement... all the way to Ebisu station. And almost always a long line of taxis waiting at the cab rank.

Basically this is a great hotel in a great sophisticated area which is quieter than the tourist hotspots of Ginza and Shibuya - yet directly linked to both by subway. My first choice in Tokyo.",5,2015/12/06
2,REDACTED,en,3615,"We are SPG Platinum travelers and have seen many SPG properties. This one is a very solid Westin. Rooms are furnished luxuriously (though not modern), the shower is awesome, the beds are comfortable, everything is nice and clean. The view from our room was fabulous, with a great view of Tokyo Tower. We tried both the breakfast in the restaurant on the lobby floor and in the lounge and would recommend the restaurant for its variety. The food is excellent though could benefit from some more made-to-order items. The hotel has a nice small gym and offers access to a large gym and pool right next door. The subway and JR trains are a short and nice 10 minute walk away (als underground if you wish through a shopping mall), there is a nice shopping mall next door (with both a grocery and a basement food hall), and Michelin-starred Joel Robuchon has two restaurants across the street if you are so inclined (reserve two weeks in advance). Overall, this property is highly recommended and a pleasure to stay at.",5,2015/12/06

2,REDACTED,en,3620,"I had been in Tokyo for 10 days already, I had decided to use my SPG points to book my last night at the Westin. My flight was leaving from Narita and the bus service was reasonably priced.

I had no issues using my SPG points to book the hotel, I also decided to drop my luggage to the airport, the day before. Bell desk was really helpful and they were more than happy to accommodate my request.

The next day, I got there an hour before check in and the front desk managed to get me into my room early ( so there was no waiting around). 

Although the rooms were dated, they are still well maintained and clean. The room had everything that I needed. The complimentary water always helps.

The bathroom was well equipped. Shower was powerful and the room was quiet.

The views were beautiful, I had the view of Tokyo Tower.

Unfortunately the spa wasnt open as it is undergoing refurbishment and if you want to use the pool, it is outside of the hotel.

For dinner I dined at Mai within the hotel. I had phoned ahead and the staff said they cater for Vegetarians. I am not sure if its coincidence or not, but when I got to the front of the restaurant, the menu was open to the Veg page.

I was travelling on my own, but the staff were lovely and the lady helped me choose what to eat and what to drink ( please try the sake, it tasted divine). 

The food was well presented and tasted delicious. The veg tempura was so fresh and the sushi was a great way to start the evening.

I then visited the bar downstairs, only downside, is that people can smoke within the bar. This is normal in alot of Japanese locations. The bar had a relaxed ambience. The drinks were good.

The next day, I checked out and jumped on the bus to the hotel. I recommend leaving plenty of time before your flight out of Narita. The bus stops at multiple hotels before heading to Narita. ( I believe there were 5 hotels after the Westin).

Great hotel, recommended for families; business staff and solo travellers.",4,2015/12/02
2,REDACTED,en,3621,"Very few international guests, mostly booked by Japanese (with a speciality in want-to-be Western-style wedding ceremonies ;-)). Needs renovation and some serious clean-up. Internet not working properly. In summary, out-of-date hotel in a nice and convenient location.",3,2015/12/01
2,REDACTED,en,3622,"Perfect location, close to city center. situated in a relatively quiet area, away from the hustle and bustle. 5 mins walk to the shopping mall which has quite a number of good restaurants. Rooms are spacious, and even in room dining food is awesome with wiide variety of choices. Perfect stay!",5,2015/11/29
2,REDACTED,en,3623,"Staying here for 15nights and the experience could have been better.

The room is huge and comfortable but the pillows are too soft.

There are a mixture of good and bad staffs in the hotel and I guessed it's depending on your luck whom you have encountered. Staying here for half a month, I have met both.

On the day of check-in, the front desk staff was fantastic. The lady kindly accommodate my request for a room near the elevator and I was informed that my room includes free breakfast and I just need to show my card key sleeve for breakfast.

On my first morning, I went ahead for breakfast but was shocked when they issued me a bill for it! I clarified with the staff at the restaurant and they brought me to the front desk to clarify. There I met the most unfriendly staff in my whole stay. The guy insisted that my room rate does not include breakfast and he gave me the kind of look as if I was trying to con a breakfast out of the hotel. After showing him my booking confirmation which clearly states that breakfast is included, he issued a coupon for my breakfast for the day but informed me that I won't be entitled for it for the rest of my stay. Seeing how unfriendly he is, I informed him that I will not pursue now but will email my booking agent and the hotel's room reservation to clarify on why there is a discrepancies between what is in black and white on my paper and his systems. Hearing that he then took out a stack of breakfast coupon and began issuing them to them. If he is so sure that my booking does not include breakfast, why did he do that after hearing that I will escalate this upward? The way he slammed the coupon on the counter as he issued them is seriously insulting to me as a guest in such a luxurious hotel.

Breakfast on weekend is really horrible. The whole hotel is filled with wedding functions on weekend and the Q for breakfast is horrible! Having slept in late on a weekend, I headed down for breakfast at 10am and was shocked by a long queue filled with prettily dressed Japanese in kimonos and all. They definitely does not look like they have stayed here for the night. Asking the waitress if I had to Q since breakfast is ending in 30mins and I only need a table for 1, she rudely point to the Q and walked away. This made me felt that the hotel actually valued their locals who is going to pay for their breakfast other than those who have paid a bomb for the room and can't even get a breakfast in peace.

Overall, the stay is good except for all the hassle relating to breakfast which is seriously a chore. My suggestion is that if you want to stay here, get it without breakfast. You seriously wouldn't want to go through those trouble to affect your mood during your stay.

I have 10 more nights to go. Hoping the experience will improve.",4,2015/11/28
2,REDACTED,en,3624,"My favorite place to stay in Tokyo. The Ebisu neighborhood, the first floor Bar, the food, the cigar club, the ambience - all provide for a refined experience. That said, SPG platinum recognition is low and the rooms are small - not a lot of suites. Not everyone's taste but that's probably why I like it so much.",5,2015/11/26
2,REDACTED,en,3625,"Having over 1800 nights as a platinum Starwood member, this was one of the worst experiences I have ever had. Staff was not accommodating and rude. In the am I went to sit in the lobby tea room which has a very large sitting area. I was approached by a hostess and asked if I wanted to order. I told her not at this time. She said If I did not order I must get up and leave. I asked her to charge me for the tea but not to bring it, just charge me for sitting. She said no and I was asked to leave. This was very rude and unprofessional. In addition I also had access to the club lounge in the hotel. I asked the club personnel if I could bring some food from my room to eat at the club lounge and was also denied that request. On another note I was having the dinner buffet in the hotel and bought a piece of Kobe beef from across the street and ask if they could cook the beef for me at an extra charge and was also denied my request. Everything asked of the hotel was NO NO NO. 
In addition I feel the hotel staff treated Japanese customers much better than Americans and foreigners. 
Worst stay ever and would not recommend this hotel.",1,2015/11/24
2,REDACTED,en,3626,I have reviewed this hotel twice before but felt I should review it again because this past visit was with our 11 year old. My husband had business in Tokyo over Thanksgiving last year and we decided to join. What a great choice the Westin was. It was all decorated for the holidays with a GIANT tree and trains and people were there getting married...all very festive. My son really loved all the fun decor and the AMAZING BIG breakfast. If you do the exec floor that is also a good call with kid in tow as sometimes kids are just too tuckered to go out to eat dinner and aren't that hungry so the snacks will do. Although it was extremely crowded at the hotel this time of year the service was very good. However breakfast was SOOOOO crowded it was less great than in past visits - make sure to leave time in the AM for you are bound to wait. We left for Hakone mid-stay and they were kind enough to hold our luggage and then re-unite us when we returned. The bus is very convenient to get to the airport by the way. It is the first stop on the route and you are guaranteed a nice seat but you HAVE to reserve the bus as they fill up. It is a long ride vs. the train BUT to get to the train you have to take the subway or take a taxi to Shinagawa so if you are traveling with more than carry on this is the way to go. They load your suitcase into the hold and away you go book in lap and next thing you know you are at the airport.,5,2015/11/24
2,REDACTED,en,3627,"The Westin in Tokyo is located in a very nice area, although a bit hard from the more traditional business and tourist areas. As a ""wedding oriented"" property built in the boom years in Japan is very fancy and they do great Christmas decorations etc. My wife really liked it.

However, as a business hotel it leaves a lot to be desired. Compared to other five star hotels in Japan I feel they really don't understand business travellers and there is always lots of confusions. The concierge staff struggles to understand English and doesn't really understand how to help. The club lounge has a decent food selection but is not conductive for business meetings etc.

On the plus side the rooms are large and well equipped (although not up to date from a technology perspective).",3,2015/11/21
2,REDACTED,en,3628,"A very cosy room with quiet environment, good breakfast (however not the best in town), Very highly trained staff, much to do walking, including a shopping center and many restaurants and bars, Metro/Train station very near, all good.
Many couples stayed there for marriage while I was there and generally, everybody seemed very happy.
I don't see it as ""fully pointed"" because the hotel is not new, because the reception and concierge attendants are too busy on the phone, and because they are charging for the wifi.
By the way, The idea of having a cigar shop is great.",4,2015/11/19
2,REDACTED,en,3629,"Another Starwood hotel with an awesome club lounge area. The staff is incredible especially Michio Sekine. He goes above and beyond in communicating goodwill and providing service to guests. Very efficient very good food and drinks. North American lounges cannot compare. Only major issue is that we need a Chardonnay next time LOL. The hotel itself is also wonderful!
",5,2015/11/17
2,REDACTED,en,3630,"Great hotel and very well located, high quality rooms, service, food etc. Can't say much more really but to highly recommend it to anyone thinking of a high quality base in Tokyo. Couple of good bars and restaurants not far away and the concierge are brilliant.",5,2015/11/17
2,REDACTED,en,3631,"From the moment my wife and I entered the hotel the service was impeccable. My wife has Platinum Status with Starwood so we were treated to a free breakfast either in the restaurant or in the exec lounge. We chose to eat in the restaurant for its greater choice. 

The breakfasts aren't as mind blowing as some reviewers suggest - the smoked salmon lacked flavour, the eggs (omelettes, poached, scrambled, boiled) always overcooked but the variety was excellent. 

I agree that the hotel isn't as modern as some suggest but this doesn't really mean it's dated it just adheres to a different style and ethos. Some my call it chintzy or gaudy but it is down to a matter of taste. The rooms themselves are perhaps nearing the time where they will need a refresh but they are in no way outdated or rundown. 

We stayed in 1619 and, once the distance mist had cleared after a couple of days, we were treated to an ace though distant view of Mt Fuji. Couldn't Westin have moved the mountain closer?! ;) We were only a couple of floors from the Exec Lounge which hosts a decent cocktail hour or two of canapes, drinks etc. If you're lucky enough to be there when the black forest gateaux is served, drive in. The view from there is pretty decent too especially when seen through the eyes of a couple of serve yourself G&Ts! One thing I would say though, the sparkling wine is revolting, stay away! 

I like to workout when on holiday and was concerned that the gym would be too small but if you know your way around a gym, there is enough to keep you buffed. I was offered on check-in the choice of using a larger gym nearby but in the end I did not want to waste my time in Tokyo looking for a squat rack for five days I could make do. Also took advantage of Westin Workout for my gym gear an absolutely superb idea. 

The alternative gym choice was offered by the platinum reception guy who came out from behind the desk to greet us when we arrived and again when we were leaving. I know exceptional customer service is trait of the Japanese but I still found every single member of staff in the hotel to go above and beyond every time we spoke to them. The staff are a real credit to the hotel. 

Finally, I note that there are some complaints about the distance from the train station to the hotel. It really isn't that far and I note that also that these complaints come in the most part from US guests. I can understand if you're not used to walking it is a bit of a trek but don't let that put you off staying in the hotel. It is in an excellent location for both exploring the great little places in Ebisu as well as Tokyo in general. The only time the really quite short and mechanically assisted walk from the station (there are travellators for Godsake!) may be an issue is if you have your suitcases. The Missus and I took the ""limousine"" coach from the airport on arrival so this wasn't an issue and took a taxi to Shinjuku when for the trainlink back to the airport at the end of our stay. 

In short, this is a great hotel in a great area..oh and of course you get your heavenly bed so you are guaranteed that wonderful Westin night's sleep",5,2015/11/16
2,REDACTED,en,3632,"I have visited Japan several times and it is the first time I stay at Westin and I will certainly come back to this hotel.
It is located in Ebisu area, quite and at the same time not too far from the busy part such Omotesando ( not to be missed with nice shops and their related architecture).
You can also find Oriental Bazar shop with nice souvenirs at very affordable prices. 
As for the hotel, a big choice of restaurants : from French to Japanese , Chinese.... as well as a bar at the top with vey nice view on the city and Tokyo Tower.
Rooms are perfectly clean and beds comfortable,.fast wifi. Executive lounge staff are amazing. 
Just in front , you can find Yebisu Garden Place where you can find many shops, reataurants including Starbucks, Burger King ( but I would recommend to eat only local food!) as well as a department store... I will definitely come back...",5,2015/11/14
2,REDACTED,en,3633,"We decided to stay at the Westin Tokyo again because of how impressed we were during our last visit in 2014. We were very pleased with our choice.

What we love most about this property is it's relatively quiet location with a bit of green space and lovely garden. It's a bit removed from the usual hustle and bustle of busy Tokyo that you find in other properties in Shibuya, Ginza or Shinjuku.

While it is a bit of a distance to the Ebisu Station, the moving Skywalk helps a lot and we had no issues going back and forth between the station and hotel, on some days several times. Ebisu Station itself has a nice selection of shops, bakeries and take out stands as well as the Atre and nearby Mitsukoshi Department Stores. Connections to the JR and Hibiya subway are also convenient to get around the city.

Service and hospitality from the entire staff was once again fantastic, the bellmen, front desk, concierge and housekeeping all made every effort to assist us with our needs. Our king bed deluxe room was large and comfortable as well as neat and clean. We love the bathroom with tub and separate shower and complimentary toiletries provided.

Upon arrival we asked the hotel if they could hold our luggage for 2 days while we made a quick out of town trip before returning for another 5 nights. They readily accommodated our request which we really appreciated. We were also given a breakfast discount as well as complimentary cocktails which we made good use of.

All in all the Westin has become our go to hotel while in Tokyo. We look forward to staying here on our next trip and highly recommend this property to others for consideration when choosing a hotel while visiting Tokyo.",5,2015/11/13

I personally think the train station is not as close as other places I've stayed, but if you don't mind the walking and are cool with allowing a bit of extra time, you can make it work. Otherwise, you'll find yourself using cabs or UBER instead. Next door is Tsutaya, a movie rental place which is open late (1am) and has snacks and cigarettes.",5,2015/11/09

The room is clean and bathroom is large.i havent seen any speckle of dust on the furnitures also.Comfortable bed and plentiful of toiletry supplies.Breakfast buffet was also very good. You can taste the freshness of the food being offered. We went out one day to explore the city and its about drizzling, we were lend umbrellas to use. Such a nice gesture. I love japan and its people, and food.Would definitely come back very soon and will stay again at westin.",4,2015/11/07
2,REDACTED,en,3637,"This was my second visit to Tokyo, with 10 years in between. I considered staying elsewhere but had enjoyed my stay here the first time and retained some knowledge of the area, so stayed with what I knew.

The hotel is an a quiet area, adjacent to Yebisu Garden Place. There is a Yamanote line station maybe 10 mins walk away, but a large part of this walk can be done by travelator - in inclement weather you can stay under cover all the way into the hotel that way.

The hotel has a grand interior, though not particularly in Japanese style, which carries through into the rooms. Spacious, with a large bathroom and very comfortable bed. There are restaurants nearby in Yebisu Garden Place and several more in the Atre near the station. The hotel also has its own, I visited the Japanese restaurant on two occasions this trip and was placed in prime position for the viewing garden each time by the perfectly attentive staff. The food was also really good - a sesame tofu in particular was delicious. 

The proximity to a Yamanote line station makes it an ideal base for exploring Tokyo (and outside if you have the time, though there is so much to do in Tokyo itself).

The staff were all helpful and attentive, though my small amount of Japanese did help - everyone has a degree of English though, so don't let that be a concern. In summary, I will go again and I won't leave it 10 years next time!",5,2015/11/07
2,REDACTED,en,3638,"But since I have been less loyal, have gone less to it. Location is in a quiet area which I personally like but it is a little out of the way for biz.

Gym is very nice and airy.",4,2015/11/06
2,REDACTED,en,3639,"This is our second stay at the Westin in lovely Ebisu Garden area of Tokyo. Its a bit out of main Tokyo however the service and staff are excellent. My husband and I traveled recently to Japan with our 17 year old granddaughter whose first trip this was to Japan. Based on my platinum status we requested a room upgrade to make sure we had space for the 3 of us and the hotel generously provided a full upgrade. The suite was spacious with 1.5 baths and a bedroom with door which added nice privacy for the 3 of us. All the amenities, including robes were stocked in 3's, the hotel had thought of everything to make our stay enjoyable.

We enjoyed the club lounge day and night and had a fabulous brunch in the hotel restaurant.

This hotel will provide a great stay for anyone wanting to explore all of Tokyo. Train and subway station just across the street in Ebisu Garden Place.",5,2015/11/04
2,REDACTED,en,3640,"Stayed here for 6 night in October, was lovely to be back,
We caught the limousine bus from Narita, takes about 11/2 hours, but the bus was comfortable and the journey pretty interesting.
We arrived about 10pm and the staff greeted us in a very friendly and polite manner. Check in was fast and we were in our room very quickly.
The hotel is in a very upmarket area in Tokyo (well, we thought so) and on the way to the train station, you walk through Ebisu Garden place, which has a wonderful Italian
bistro and a Mitsokushi dept store, which is really lovely.
The walk to the train station is about 5 minutes mostly on a moving walkway, and once you get there, there are shops, cafes, supermarkets, every thing you could need.
The area itself was very enjoyable and safe, we often went for long walks around the area after dinner, very interesting.
We enjoyed our stay so much that we will be back in March for Easter and the Cherry blossoms.",5,2015/11/03
2,REDACTED,en,3641,"Westin Tokyo is located in Ebisu, a short walk to Ebisu JR station via Ebisu Garden Place. The location is pretty decent but there are better located hotels in Azabu, Akasaka, etc. 

If you're using Starwood points, like we did, then I guess it will do - although I can't see why anyone would pay full price for this property especially since it's so dated. Room furnishings and carpet, even the bathrooms would have been amazing back in the 80s (which is what can be said of many of the older and larger hotels in Tokyo), however in this day and age, we would have been happy to sacrifice some of the space for some modern upgrades.

SPG lounge is a nice touch - has a city view and the food is actually decent (which is more than can be said for some other Starwood properties - Hello Moana Surfrider).

Concierge is okay at this hotel, some good recommendations, some really mediocre recommendations. If you do want to make a reservation for Sukibayashi Jiro Roppongi via the concierge, please be advised that Jiro does NOT take reservations from this hotel as they've previously had some sort of a misunderstanding. 

Bell desk actually forgot that we were waiting for the limousine bus to Narita and left our luggage sitting in a corner while we watched other people board the bus so that was fun.",3,2015/11/02
2,REDACTED,en,3642,"If you can afford Westin Tokyo and/or get a good deal, you will not be disappointed. For Japanese standards, according to several colleagues who had stayed elsewhere during previous trips, this is a luxury hotel. For me, my first time to Japan, it was a great choice, especially compared to a couple other hotels I visited where others in my department were staying.

The Westin is all about class. The care here is top-notch. There’s a general sense of civility and service throughout Tokyo and it’s at an extreme at this hotel. The moment I arrived, I was warmly greeted by the staff, each willing to help me carry my bag, open the door, assist with directing me to check-in, etc. There is no tipping here, so the behavior has no ulterior motive than to make the guest feel welcome. I felt extremely welcome. Check-in was a breeze, and the front desk clerk acted courteously and full of grace while asking for my credit card and passport. My efforts to reciprocate in simple Japanese were received with the utmost appreciation. All in all, it was an excellent first impression of this country I knew little about.

My room, 1101, had two double beds rather than one king, but I was alone and one bed was plenty. Moreover, the room size was nowhere near matchbox size that people talk about as common in Tokyo. I had a full-length picture window to see the city skyline, a room thermostat, a desk with Ethernet cable, a make-up table with mirror that, not too surprisingly, I never used, a large Panasonic television that I never watched (too many films on my 13.5 hour flight from Boston), a large closet, complimentary water and rice cooker (I still don’t understand that one), and a bathroom fit for a king. In it, there was a near full length tub with metal handles for easy entry and departure, a separate high end shower stall with metal hand spray and top down shower nozzle, a sink, and a state-of-the-art toilet bidet combination that made me regret not having upgraded accordingly when I redid my bathroom earlier this year. Never had I tried such a contraption, but I was a big fan in no time! The cleansing water was self-directed and warm. Absolutely brilliant!

The bed was a bit on the hard side for my taste, as if Westin was still adhering to the old philosophy that firm beds offered better support than plush ones. There were three foam pillows straight out of Goldilocks and the Three Bears – small, medium, and large. I always ended up with large and dumped the other two on the floor.

In the morning, I took advantage of the breakfast buffet which was included in my rate. There, I enjoyed a potpourri of extravagant foods with similar cordial service. Highlights included strong café in a bowl with accompanying milk, a spinach, celery, and pineapple smoothie, pain au chocolat and croissants, muesli with dried fruit, omelet station, miso soup, pork bouillon with bacon, a collection of cheeses, smoked salmon, and dried fish, stir fried noodles, yogurt, and about a dozen other dishes.

Westin Tokyo took about 1h20 to reach from Narita airport using the Narita Express train then changing for four more stops at Shinegawa station. That stop is about 10 minutes by foot from the hotel in an upper class area, accessible either through a path between buildings above ground or a commercial tunnel a la Montreal. There’s a nice mall with some great shops on the way, and on the other side of the Ebuis station, there are a number of great little restaurants that don’t cost much at all.

Definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2015/11/01
2,REDACTED,en,3643,"I spent 20 nights at the Tokyo Westin in the last month and can't recommend this hotel enough. The staff is superb- they truly embody the spirit of Japanese hospitality. Nothing is too much to ask and they never seem to be overwhelmed. They are friendly and enjoy getting to know their guests personally.

In addition to the great staff, the rooms are excellent. For Tokyo, they were quite spacious and well appointed. The rooms seemed newly refinished and well maintained. Excellent view of Tokyo Tower and the downtown. As a nice perk, they have the softest yukata (Japanese robe) in the rooms. I tried to find one as soft in stores and I couldn't.

The location is good- it's not downtown, but their are two nearby subway stations. One of which- Ebisu- is on a JR line for tourists with a JR Rail Pass. Their are always taxis too. It's an upscale residential neighborhood, so their are plenty of restaurants, convenience stores etc nearby. They have a lovely garden in the back of the hotel.

Try the breakfast- it was a wonderful spread of both western and Japanese options. Fresh juice, omelets, a great selection of bread etc. It seems to be popular with locals on weekends and holidays too.

The Westin Tokyo has become my home away from home and I highly recommend it.",5,2015/10/28
2,REDACTED,en,3644,"The Westin Tokyo is an excellent hotel to stay at for business or pleasure. It is located in Ebisu, which has a beautiful mall across the street with shopping and restaurants. The Westin is in walking distance to the train station, which is a main point on the Yamanote line, allowing travelers access to anywhere in the city with ease.

The rooms are extremely clean and spacious. The bathroom is elegant and the rooms have nice extra space with a desk for any type of office use. The beds are very comfortable and the view from the 10th floor of the hotel was nice.

I thought that the service at the Westin Tokyo was outstanding. Laundry service was extremely quick and did a fantastic job. The room cleaning crew did an amazing job keeping the room tidy and clean. Front desk and staff we also very helpful and kind.

I recommend the Westin if you seek a higher-end hotel that is centrally located.",5,2015/10/27

The staff speak english and we shown to our very large room (by Japanese standards) in a very courteous manner.

I`d suggest a city view room here because the outlook is fantastic including views of the Tokyo Tower.

The buffet breakfasts were great with a fine selection of western cuisine.

If you look lost in the foyer, 2-3 staff members are on you asking how they may help you.

Was a fantastic hotel at welcoming us to Japan.",5,2015/10/26
2,REDACTED,en,3646,"I stayed at the Westin hotel due to its fabulous location, close to the subway, good neighbourhood, quality hotel (rooms, beds, dining, and drinks), and friendly staff. Around the neighbourhood you have shopping, dining and within minutes you can be on the subway or taxi's (conveniently located downstairs) to take you to cool districts and areas.",5,2015/10/24
2,REDACTED,en,3647,"This hotel is really lovely. The staff, especially the lovely Italian woman who worked the lobby (I cannot remember her name, doh) was very sweet. The rooms are nice sized, especially for Tokyo, and well appointed. Japanese breakfast was absolutely stellar, even in the SPG breakfast room. 

There is a bit of a language issue with the front desk staff. The concierges were great, but the front desk staff should be much more fluent in English. The Japanese people loathe saying no, or not being able to please you, but in the end honesty is better than politeness. We bought some pastries in the hotel bakery (delicious) and had them boxed up, so they could be placed in our friend's room when they checked in. Seems simple enough. The front desk seemed to understand and agree to this, but somehow mucked it up. So our friends check in, nothing in their room. The next day we tried to find out what happened and it took FOREVER, only to yield that the box of pastries, now 24 hours old, was in the bell storage area. Then they tried to deliver those. We said they were old and needed to be replaced. The entire thing took hours of conversations, really ridiculous, until finally they replaced them and still couldn't manage to deliver them. Day 3 our friends asked for the package, and it was at the front desk. We gave up.

Otherwise, it is lovely but they should have a front desk staffer or manager who can communicate in English since a lot of westerners stay there.",4,2015/10/23
2,REDACTED,en,3648,A wonderful choice for families and couples. The hotel is situated in a quiet area of the city with a beautiful park near by but also has Ebisu Garden across.

You may hear rumors that hotel rooms are small in Japan those people obviously never stayed at this Westin because the rooms are very large.

Spa is great an never crowded.",5,2015/10/21
2,REDACTED,en,3650,"This is an elegant old-school Tokyo hotel---gorgeous lobby, superlative service, etc.
PROS: 
* BY FAR the biggest rooms at relatively low prices--our room held two full-size beds, a sitting area, coffee/fridge area, a desk, and an old-fashioned ladies' vanity table, plus a large bathroom with a big bathtub and a separate shower with a combo rain shower/handheld spray attachment. By contrast, we did spend one night at a different hotel closer to Haneda airport that was half the size at twice the price. 
* two room safes, one powered so you can charge your laptop while you're out
* crisp, starched sheets and lovely pristine bedding...well, everything was pristine and the towels were So Fluffy.
* we scored an online bargain that included breakfast every day for two, and the breakfast buffet was lavish: fresh fruit, western standards (bacon, eggs, cereals, omelette station, yogurts, waffles/french toast, fantastic pastries, all kinds of breads...plus European (cold meats/cheeses), Japanese and Chinese breakfast items, smoothies, fresh-squeezed juices, and also some creative hybrids like seasoned chicken oatmeal (!). You guys, the breakfast alone is reason to stay here!!
* it's in Ebisu Garden Place, which puts on regular thingies...while we were there they had a three-day ""festival"" so we got to enjoy a fashion show, some kind of soccer demonstration, and an unbelievable performance by two beautiful and crazy-talented violinists. On prior visits we saw a HUGE Christmas display of holiday lights and a giant crystal bell. 

CONS:
* the decor is spotless and elegant, but might not suit you if you are looking for ultra-hip (more marble/inlaid polished wood, less leather/plastic).
* it's about 8-10 minute walk to the Ebisu station, but at least a third of that is on a moving sidewalk (called the ""skywalk"")
* it's not located in the main nightlife areas, but there are plenty of restaurants, conbinis (convenience stores), and a major department store right across the street.

I'm confused by the reviews that say this hotel is ""just OK""...we were on the ""club level"" so maybe the other level is not as wonderful? Anyway, we've stayed at 5 or 6 hotels in Tokyo and this one is by far the best value---there were so many nice touches, they are generous with amenities, the rooms are big big big, and the staff is fantastic. We will be back!",5,2015/10/16
2,REDACTED,en,3651,"Good example of a Westin as they are intended to be. Lots of restaurant choices (although I will always rather eat out in town somewhere), fairly large rooms, some with good views of Tokyo, a bar in which you can smoke cigars. Spacious bathrooms, for Japanese standards. Although I'm sure they have different room sizes and furnishings. 

Located close to an area with tons of restaurants of all kinds of styles, price levels, ethnicities. 

I love running outside, and I was looking forward to a run in the nearby park. But that one requires an entrance fee and doesn't look like they'd let you jog there. That leaves city streets or the gym. 

Pretty good hotel for business trips.",4,2015/10/12
2,REDACTED,en,3652,"I wasn't sure about the location but it turned out closer and rather well connected. the walk to the station isn't short and quick but its a nice walk. The service was excellent, top ratings. The room was big and impressive even though I didn't like the very Western interior design throughout the building. If you want a Japanese feeling in decor- this isn't it. But otherwise its a great hotel.",5,2015/10/11
2,REDACTED,en,3653,"It was OK- nothing extraordinary about this Westin, I've stayed in much much nicer ones. The SPG choices in Tokyo aren't that great... Still waiting on a W to pop-up. Tokyo seems PERFECT for a W property. 

The location is pretty prime. It's not in the center of the craziness... But across the street in walking distance you have shopping, eating, gardens and a subway access. You can be in the Ginza area in about 10-15 minutes via the subway or Roppongi in about 5.

It definitely is a BIG business, conference hotel. 

The rooms are very very tired and in need of a major update. That was the most dissapointing part of our couples stay. That and the flat, lumpy pillows.",3,2015/10/07
2,REDACTED,en,3654,"Excellent property, upscale, and certainly in a quieter area. The 10 minute walk to the train station is an excellent trade off to stay in this lovely location. I had a 48 hour stay and managed to get around quite a bit by rail. Breakfast was wonderful both days with no problem getting a coffee. Dinner at Yebisu was worth every yen. Thanks to Naoki at Service Express and Miki at Concierge for helping me get it all done in such a short stay. Great views from the city view room. Excellent platinum recognition.",5,2015/10/06
2,REDACTED,en,3655,"We stayed in this hotel for 6 nights and we just had a great stay. The staff is very friendly and the location is also good. Yes it a few minutes walk to the public transport,.. but most of the distance is over a sky automatic walk,.. so very easy. The connection from Ebisu station is great as there is a stop for JR and Metro. It is really SUPER easy to get to all the places you want to go in Tokyo!

The rooms are big for Tokyo standards.

The hotel decoration is very classic,... maybe a bit too classic for what I am used to from Westin. However this was no issue for us at all.

I just felt that at the breakfast buffet downstairs some optimizations can be made. I found the buffet choise not massive for such a big hotel... but the biggest issue was the staff. I had the feeling there was often too little staff and it took a long time till coffee came and dirty plates were replaced. 

However - do not let that small thing scare you off. I would recomment this hotel for a holiday or business trip in Tokyo!",5,2015/10/05
2,REDACTED,en,3656,"I really did not like the decor of this hotel. It felt like being in San Diego in 1990.

The faux European nonsense was all over the place: columns in our room, plastic painted like marble in the bathroom, gilt touches all over the lobby.

The problem is, this hotel is part of the Ebisu Garden Place, which is all decorated in dated earth-toned stone. 

If you are going to Tokyo, why not get Tokyo?

Beyond that breakfast was pretty decent, service was fine. Pool was a bit far and not a pool for relaxing, just for exercise.

Even as a Starwood Platinum, I won't be back. I'll go back to the Sheraton, or I'll just stay at one of the Hyatts.",3,2015/10/04
2,REDACTED,en,3657,"The location is outside the busiest areas of Tokyo but absolutely convenient because getting to Japan Rail and the Ebisu subway station is quick and easy because of moving walkways from the stations to the hotel through a fabulous YEbisu Garden Mall. We were tired when we arrived, and the check in staff noticed it so brought us water as we approached the desk. The hotel is spotless, the restaurants serve terrific food, and if you are a Starwood Menber, you get a complimentary Breakfast which is healthy and delicious on the 17th floor, plus afternoon appetizers that are yummy and complimentary liquor. Gorgeous views from the room, too. Outstanding staff everywhere. Gym is good, but if you want a swim and a top rated gym, request complimentary passes to a nearby gym that even has an outdoor hot tub and an area to practice golf and have a lesson. It has a unique layout, and complimentary bathrobes and you will learn not to wear gym shoes in the dressing room. Every superlative can be applied to this property. Miki at the Concierge Desk was particularly helpful as well as everyone throughout the the hotel. Great Wu fi and too bad not free for everyone.",5,2015/10/02
2,REDACTED,en,3658,"This hotel is in Ebisu not terribly far from the train station (thanks to motorized walkways) but it is just outside of Tokyo proper - in an elegant residential area. If you want to experience the real daily life of Japanese people, I would recommend this hotel. We witnessed multiple beautiful weddings here on the weekends. While there are a few restaurants to choose from at the hotel, there are a bunch of great options and variety in the Yebisu Gardens plaza just across the street. My two recommendations are either the little Italian place for excellent pasta or the french bakery St Germain for croissants and treats that are better than anything I've ever tasted in Paris. As for the hotel, the decor is extravagant-elegance. Definitely and older style but one that remains beautiful when well maintained. The staff is incredibly helpful and kind. They even added foam egg crates to our bed when we told them it was too hard for us to sleep. We've stayed her twice now on our vacations to Japan and will definitely be back. 
Note: they do not have a pool but you can have access to the gym/pool facilities across the street (accessed by an unground tunnel) at Yebisu but there is a daily fee for that.",4,2015/09/29
2,REDACTED,en,3659,"Westin Tokyo is easily accessible from the nearest train station Ebisu. The new sheltered skywalk to Ebisu Garden is enjoyable and convenient. 

Hotel is nicely decorated and very different from other Westin. Abundance of Food & Beverage options in the hotel, including the exquisite Teppanyaki experience on the top floor. 

Being along the Yamonote line, the Japan Rail Pass provides complimentary access to many tourist attraction including Shibuya (Meiji Shrine/Shibuya Crossing), Shinjuku and Akihabara.",4,2015/09/27
2,REDACTED,en,3660,"We all expect Westin Hotels to be the same: reliable, comfortable, competent. But most of all, we expect them to deliver what they promise. 

Right now, this hotel's website (and guest directory) say: ""Interested guests can take advantage of the swimming pool in the adjacent Club at Yebisu Garden for a fee; Starwood Preferred Gold and Platinum guests swim for free.""

It's not true. If you are under 20 (twenty), you cannot swim in that pool. Point blank refusal. Many insincere and meaningless apologies from management; a suggestion of taking a taxi to the Sheraton (where I could pay! for my kids to swim); no change to the website. 

Vote with your feet.",1,2015/09/24
2,REDACTED,en,3661,"My husband and I traveled to Japan last Christmas... We had never been there before and were incredibly excited to explore a new beautiful country. And what a country it is!

We stayed at the Westin for the first two nights of our stay... It was in a good location, close to the metro which will take you all around Tokyo. The staff was so nice and helpful and the hotel was beautiful. We felt very much at home here

Don't miss their daily brunch- it's fantastic and has so many options of food!

We want to go back and explore more of Tokyo and when we do, we will definitely stay here!",5,2015/09/23
2,REDACTED,en,3662,"Possibly this is a good hotel for business travellers and given the easy proximity to the train station, fine if you are just looking for a big 'safe' chain hotel to return to at night. But if you're looking to also get a feel for Tokyo, I'd recommend looking elsewhere as there appears very little 'neighbourhood' around it: in fact directly opposite is a faux French chateau specialising in weddings and an Italian restaurant - and just beyond that a very bland mall. Certainly we had a better experience as travellers in terms of proximity to local restaurants and street activity at another time staying in the Shiba Park district. From a service perspective, our experience at the Westin was not great (I won't re-live it here)and although ultimately our concerns were resolved, it is apparent that chaos ensues when large groups (such as multiple wedding parties) arrive. Although clean and functional, the décor does need modernising and rather surprisingly the lifts do not have a security swipe system to ensure appropriate floor access. I wouldn't say 'don't do it' - after all, it is perfectly functional - but I really think you can do better.",3,2015/09/21
2,REDACTED,en,3663,"First, I will say that this is a lovely hotel with a very friendly staff. We have been in our SPG floor room for a few days, and it has been a nearly perfect stay. I live the bed (very firm), the bathroom is efficient & pretty, and the view is spectacular. There is an underground walkway that leads to the Ebisu Station (puts you minutes from any place you'll need to get to!). 
The only criticism I have is about a promotion through SPG. If you dine in the hotel, and you use your SPG Amex card, you're supposed to get 15% off your food tab. I've been dining and not seeing the discount, so I asked at the SPG desk. They were gracious, however, now I've had to take a few calls and messages. I've been sent back to the restaurants with my card to beg for the discount, but the manager wasn't there. So, now I am told to wait for yet another phone call that will allow me to run back down to the restaurant to again beg for my discount. Really? This is not professional, and I expect better from SPG as well as Westin. Ideally, this would have been corrected internally...as it is a Westin promotion, not to mention that I am supposed to be enjoying my vacation, not running around correcting the hotel's mistake.",4,2015/09/21
2,REDACTED,en,3664,"I was here a few weeks ago with work, and I'm actually coming back in the next couple of days. This is a large hotel by Japanese standards, with a massively imposing foyer area, with sweeping marble staircase. It does however feel a bit dated, and given its large size, it could do with a refurbishment.

The amenities here are very good, including ""The Bar"" where a large selection of cocktails from all parts of the World are put together nicely. I recommend the Orange Mojito as a nice one to try!

The rooms are again a little bit dated but fairly comfortable. I have been staying on Sheraton hotels (from the same group) and the Westin rooms are definitely not as nice.

One of the best aspects of this hotel is its location, and the fact that is directly connected via underground passage to Ebisu station and the fabulous Ebisu Garden complex, with a great number of restaurants, shops and sitting areas.

So, if you don't mind the slightly dated feel (not a major issue, honestly) the location and proximity to a large number of amenities and near JR stations such as Shibuya and Meguro make this a highly recommended hotel.",4,2015/09/18
2,REDACTED,en,3665,"Lovely hotel, nice central location. Lovely breakfast options and nice cocktail bar 22nd floor. A bit too Americanised. Good gym facilities. Typical standard upmarket hotel. Fantastic breakfast selection.",3,2015/09/17
2,REDACTED,en,3666,"This hotel fit our needs perfectly during our 8-day stay in Tokyo. The location is fantastic - close to Ebisu Station (both for JR and Tokyo Metro lines) and, as we found out, connected by an underground walkway on the B1 level. This is very helpful if a typhoon or two comes screaming through.

From Ebisu Station, it's one stop to Shibuya, four to Shinjuku, four to Shinagawa and nine to Tokyo Station on the JR Yamanote Line. On the Hibiya Line, it's two stops to Roppongi, six to Ginza and eight to Tsukiji.

The staff was very helpful at every point during our stay. The concierge will call ahead to ensure that a place is open when you want to go there. The breakfast on the 17th floor Executive Club was great and you get a lot of options to start your day.",5,2015/09/16
2,REDACTED,en,3667,Classy central 5 star hotel located 10mins walk to Ebisu Yamanote line. Top service with plenty of dinning options either within hotel or in the near by shopping area in MIstukoshi. No swimming pool in hotel.,5,2015/09/16
2,REDACTED,en,3668,"The hotel is amazing. Very comfortable, luxurious, with a lounge that looks to beautiful garden. 
Hotel is located at Ebisu. You need to check where Ebisu is on Tokyo metro map. It is not far from major attractions but cannot say that the ""location is absolutely perfect"". From hotel, you need to wall to Ebisu Garden and there you can have train or metro. Walk takes 5 min. 
While Ebisu is not too central, it is a very elite neighborhood, i would live there if i would move to Tokyo:)
",5,2015/09/15
2,REDACTED,en,3669,"The location is unsurpassable at the Ebisu Beer Garden with access to the Mitsukoshi department store and dozens of other stores, an indoor walkway connection to the Ebisu Train Station which is in the JR train routes. Bakeries, fast food, a bank, clothing stores, a drug store, fitness center, and even a place near the bank upstairs where they serve exotic flavored soft serves. The hotel itself looks pristine and the service is top notch. Very elegant lobby with a spiral staircase and free WiFi in the lobby. As a Westin hotel, the rooms come with their recent innovation, Heavenly Beds. There is a fitness center on the 4th floor that's free of charge. There are restaurants within the hotel as well as extensive room service.",5,2015/09/12
2,REDACTED,en,3670,"I stayed at the Westin for 4+ weeks and the property in Tokyo is outstanding. Great decor, polite and extremely helpful staff. Taxi's are problematic when its raining but that was the only issues i faced. The Location is outstanding - Close to the Ebisu Station, you can walk underground from the station directly to the hotel. In the gardens there are many restaurants, places to visit and things to explore. 

I found it difficult for my first few days dining in Tokyo due to my dietary requirements (Vegetarian) - I went to the Terrace restaurant on the 1st floor and met Daniel Jäger, He is an outstanding chef - He was able to make me something new everyday and i was not disappointed with the meals. Being a vegetarian wasn't easy but Daniel made it easy, I visited the restaurant 5 times a week and was blown away every time with the service from the staff and the chefs themselves.

The Restaurant staff and the Hotel staff are very accommodating and welcoming - The concierge are extremely helpful. This hotel is well managed and I hope to return soon.",5,2015/09/12

My son was extremely happy when we checked in all the way until we checked out.The hotel staff were very friendly and service was very good. We were upgraded to club floor and had access to the lounge to enjoy all the free stuff offered by the hotel. Although hotel is a little bit far to the subway station but more like a business type of hotel but still good for family to visit. I'd actually prefer to stay here than other busy districts in Tokyo.",5,2015/09/09
2,REDACTED,en,3672,"This hotel is in Ebisu. On the Japan Rail and Tokyo Metro Hibiya line (gray). Good hotel - part of the Yebisu Garden Place complex. Didn't try any of the restaurants inside, but ate in the building near it ... Glass Square. Be prepared to transfer at least once if you are committed to the Metro.",4,2015/09/06
2,REDACTED,en,3673,"I spent a weekend at the hotel, between 2 busy weeks. Classy interiors, high spec food and especially the pastries. Gym small but ok equipped, no pool. 

Not too far from the Ebisu metro/JR station, walking distance. Surroundings a bit isolated, boring and artificial but a quick JR trip to Harajuku and Shinjuku. 

For tourism I'd rather stay in area with more action.",4,2015/09/06
2,REDACTED,en,3674,"My 2 day stay with this hotel was excellent. Check in and check out was very fast and all staffs were very helpful. I loved the breakfast, the spread was superb. The sky bar and restaurant was simply superb with city view.",5,2015/09/05
2,REDACTED,en,3675,"We stayed at the Westin in Tokyo for 3 nights in September, we booked this using SPG points (free stay) based on reviews mentioning this as the best Starwood hotel in the city. I was very impressed with everything about this hotel, the service was top notch, the room was quite large with a couch (not that we used it) and very comfy bed. 

The bathroom which is always a key point for a hotel room in my mind was also well sized with a fancy Toto washlet toilet and separate shower and tub. I was especially impressed with the water pressure in the shower and the smartly designed rain shower head which was the best I have seen in a hotel (shower wand is also an option too). My wife really liked the scent of the bath products and even took some left over shampoo home! 

The hotel is as most reviews note in a quiet part of the city and about 10 minute walk from the Ebisu station. The walk was only a little inconvenient as there are escalators and moving walkways almost the entire way and you can stay under cover the entire time (unless it is after 10pm and the Westin lower level entrance is closed which happened one night).

Being SPG gold we were entitled to Internet or a free gift, the WiFi at the hotel however was already free (it is fast too) so we just took 250 starpoints as the gift. Our view from the hotel was just ok (on the 8th floor), but we really were not in the room much anyways.

In terms of improvements, I did wish the exchange rate was a bit better at the front desk, I understand paying somewhat for convenience but it was about 8 yen different than the official rate which is a big difference in my mind. Other minor items, the shelf in the shower is a bit small for items beyond the provided shampoo and body wash and the towels were on the smaller side (nothing has ever compared to the Conrad Miami towels), but these are very minor items.

In summary, we very much enjoyed our stay here, I found the room very elegant in style, the bed was incredibly comfortable and the service top notch. This was our first time in Tokyo but if I was heading back I almost definitely would stay here again.",5,2015/09/04
2,REDACTED,en,3676,"Just left Tokyo and had a great experience at The Westin. Upon arrival after a 14-hour flight from NY, we were warmly greeted and check-in was quick and my wife's SPG Gold status was acknowledged. We were upgraded to a corner suite on a high floor with access to the Executive Level Lounge. The lounge was a great venue to start our day off with a plentiful breakfast which included both Japanese and Western fare (including scrambled eggs). We do not drink alcohol, but the Executive Level Lounge also played host to a happy hour in the evenings with some lite bites. 

We really appreciated the very helpful and accommodating Concierge team, especially Miki, who helped us secure an English speaking private guide within 3 hours of our request! Due to the unfortunate bombings in Bangkok, we made a last-minute change to our Asia vacation itinerary, so we had little time to do our research of what to see and do in the local area. Miki was unfazed by our lack of preparation and was extremely patient in offering us her recommendations. We really appreciated her assistance, and having a private guide to show us around town on our first full-day in Tokyo gave us the confidence to navigate Tokyo's mass transit system on our own throughout our stay. 

The room was extremely spacious and my wife loved the heated toilet seat and one of the best showers we have ever experienced in a hotel in terms of consistent pressure and temperature. Our only gripe was with the firmness of the Heavenly Bed. Having stayed in numerous Westin Hotels and even own a Heavenly Bed at home - this was clearly either a very old and worn-out mattress or not the usual pillow-top mattress that is part of the standard Heavenly Bed package. Again, this was only a minor inconvenience and did not detract from our experience at all. After flying half-way around the world, we had no issues falling asleep!

The area around the hotel is awesome and it's a pleasant 10-12 minute (covered) walk through a nice mall to the Ebisu train station that will allow you to conveniently access other parts of Tokyo.

All in all, we had a great stay and will definitely book the Westin Tokyo again for any future travels to that part of the world!",5,2015/09/03
2,REDACTED,en,3677,"After a visit to the Tokyo Disney Resort, we came to the city area and I booked us in to The Westin Tokyo for a 5 nights' stay.

The moment we got off the bus, the horse carriage parked near the main door immediately got our attention. Classic and classy looking carriage.

Getting into the lobby, we can't help but feel great with the classic, luxurious feel decor. I would say it is a beautiful hotel. However, to some people, this hotel may feel dated with the classic style decorations (and probably haven't had a major refurbishment for quite some time). The hotel has been around for many years but the maintenance team has done a great job.

Checking in was friendly, efficient and the staff who checked us in was very accommodating. Being a SPG Platinum Member, we were upgraded to one of their suites. The room was spacious with a living area, a room, a small washroom in the living area and super spacious bathroom in the room area. There was also a sort of kitchen table-top with a Nespresso coffee machine, a water boiler, a wash basin and a mini fridge tucked in a cabinet. 

The Westin signature ""Heavenly bed"" here is slightly less ""fluffy"" then the other Westin properties I have stayed in but it was still very comfortable. The bathroom was beautiful and we absolutely loved it. Overall, we enjoyed the room but feel that it is about time for the property to do some refurbishments.

Executive Lounge provides evening snacks and drinks during the happy hour and also simple breakfast in the morning for guests with access to the lounge. The staffs manning the Executive Lounge were efficient, courteous and friendly. Unfortunately due to the availability of many choices for food in the vicinity as well as downtown, we did not sample any of the other restaurants in the property.

The hotel is located in a quiet residential area with a mall across the road. There is a Mitsukoshi department store and some restaurants in the adjacent block plus up in the office tower. Even if you don't venture downtown, there are plenty of F&B choices in the hotel as well as within the hotel vicinity.

Everywhere inside the hotel was very clean (but then again, this is Japan and most of the places are very clean) and all the staffs are friendly and tries to accommodate as much as they can.

It was a fantastic stay for us and we are looking forward to returning to this property for our future visit to Tokyo.",5,2015/09/01
2,REDACTED,en,3678,"Not in the usual ""touristic"" spots, but the Ebisu area is lovely and wonderfully connected and the Westin is always the Westin.

Next time I'll just book the room, no breakfast package.",5,2015/08/30

2,REDACTED,en,3680,"I really have to thank the Westin concierge for their fantastic service. They secured several reservations at key restaurants and helped make our trip a success, and kept great email communication. I would recommend them without hesitation.

I would also note that the location of the Westin is not as bad as some of these posts make it out to seem. At a normal walking pace it is probably no more than 15 minutes walk to Ebisu station, all in a covered walkway. The Ebisu station is on the Yamanote line, which is arguably the most useful line in Tokyo, as well as the Hibiya line.",5,2015/08/28

This one in Tokyo is solid, not spectacular. 

Service levels are high (as you'd expect). Staff were very courteous, friendly and helpful. That was a tick.

Room was big enough (for Tokyo) but decor was dated.

Gym was very small and nothing to get too excited about. Not a lot of choice in terms of machines. 

Feels overall like it needs a refresh and some extra elements added to justify the cost.",3,2015/08/22
2,REDACTED,en,3685,Hotel is ~ 10 min sheltered walk to the subway and closeby to a Joel Robuchon restaurant if that's your thing. Rooms are a little dated but very spacious by Tokyo standards! Prices are expensive though but I guess that's the norm for hotels in Tokyo.,4,2015/08/20
2,REDACTED,en,3686,"When I used to visit Tokyo in the past, I would stay at the Sheraton Miyako. I was unable to get a room on this visit and opted to stay at The Westin. The bonus was that the hotel was a very short walk away from where I had to meet people for work and leisure.

This is an old hotel right across the street from Yebisu Garden Place. The neighborhood is great and there are a lot of wonderful restaurants around the area.

I arrived late in the evening and therefore the check-in process was smooth and swift as there were no crowds.

My room was fairly decent sized although it may be rated as small by typical SEA standards. Everything was well maintained and worked perfectly. I had to hunt for the safe deposit box though.

The bed was standard King size and very comfortable. There was a work desk facing the window and again it was basic but comfortable. The wifi connection was steady and the speed was adequate for most requirements. There was a standard flat screen TV set at a really odd angle though.

The air conditioning worked really well and those who have traveled to Tokyo in summer will know how important this really is.

My room faced another building so the view wasn't that great. Having lived in that area before, some of the views are much better.

The bathroom was relatively larger than I expected. There was the typical washlet but it did not have instructions in English. Thankfully as I am used to them, no mishaps occurred due to the push of a wrong button. There was a separate shower stall and a bath tub. The water pressure was very good and the water heated up quite well. Toiletries were the standard basic Westin issue.

Other than use the concierge desk to book the ticket for the bus to the airport, I did not interact much with the staff on this short trip.

I did have breakfast at the restaurant and keep in mind that if you are on a corporate booking, showing the key will get you a fairly substantial discount on the buffet rate.

In all, a great option to stay in the Ebisu area.",4,2015/08/18
2,REDACTED,en,3687,"I stayed in this hotel for 3 weeks due to working nearby. I had an initial issue with check in as I was arriving at 11am (prior to check in at 2pm) but had checked previously that there would be availability for me to check in early. This was apparently agreed with my company however when I arrived there were no rooms available and therefore I had to wait until 1:30pm to check in. When I went at this time there was still no rooms available so instead I upgraded to the executive rooms for a discounted price.

The view from my room on the 20th floor was amazing and the room was a good size. It was very clean and finished to a high standard. The staff were very friendly and assisted me with anything I needed. 

I did not eat at the hotel very often as the food was very pricey. I would also avoid doing laundry as that was also very expensive. It is in a good area near Ebisu station and the garden place which is full of different food restaurants.

Overall I enjoyed my stay. I have stayed in other hotels in Tokyo and this was probably the most expensive however it did provide good service.",5,2015/08/16
2,REDACTED,en,3688,"I stayed at Westin Tokyo for 5 nights, and I am about to be a Platinum SPG member. I travel a lot for work, and I have international bank cards that never created any problems so far. On my 2nd day in Tokyo, my Mastercard had an issue and I totally ran out of cash. My AMEX card - the card I used at my hotel check in- was working, but I was planning to spend the weekend in Kyoto where you need cash.

Long story short, I begged the hotel concierge and manager literally for 2 days, sent them 6 emails in total. I told them I am ready to pay any commission if they find a way to get me some cash. I could get it wired from my family in the US, they could tell me if there is a Western Union type of company I can use, they could charge my AMEX some amount, and give it to me as cash and I was OK with any commission as I was in a really difficult situation. I had to stop by 3 lunch places one day to find the one that accepts AMEX, I did not have a penny and I don't know anybody in Tokyo.

I finally went to Grand Hyatt and told them the situation. They did not believe their ears and were shocked that Westin did not move a finger to help me. They talked to a customer who was having dinner there, he was planning to pay cash. I paid for them with my AMEX and got the cash. Solution was so simple and definitely not worth the stress for 2 days.

On top of it, I had a lot of issues with wifi and electricity went off 2 times.

I would definitely not recommend Westin Tokyo to anyone.",1,2015/08/14

Do not miss trying the food and breakfast they serve in the executive lounge as they have typical Japanese appetizers and also very good breakfast. The staff were extremely kind and helpful",5,2015/08/12
2,REDACTED,en,3690,"This hotel may not be in the best location but it has made up with its spacious room size!

The location is near Ebisu train station and it takes about 20 min to walk to the station. Nearby there are nothing much except for small eateries. At least Ebisu train station is easily accessible to near by hot spots like Shin juku and Harajuku.

Will consider to stay again!",4,2015/08/11

2,REDACTED,en,3692,It is a very clean and comfortable hotel with well laid out rooms. Staff do speak English very well even though I had managed to learn Japanese they were keen to speak in English. Room service is excellent as is the club level rooms. Pre stay was very professional and I was able to email the hotel before the stay to arrange for private car transfers. Overall I could not fault this hotel and would stay there again.,5,2015/08/09
2,REDACTED,en,3693,"stayed here for 3 nights on the 14th floor. we had access to the executive lounge, which was nice, with happy hour each evening, but the food offerings were a little underwhelming. the room itself was plenty large and clean, but a bit outdated. location is good with access to the JR ebisu station on the yamanote line, but it's a bit of a walk - at least most of it is covered and (somewhat) air conditioned! the breakfast buffet at the restaurant downstairs is pretty tasty but youll have to eat quite a bit to make it worth the $30~ (unless it's included in your rate - then, awesome!) looks like each point im making comes with some kind of caveat... all in all, not a bad place to stay at while in tokyo, but if you want something more modern or in a livelier area, this might not meet your needs.",4,2015/08/08
2,REDACTED,en,3694,"The Westin is well located near a good selection of shops and restaurants and a bit of a walk to Ebisu station. Check in is quick, the rooms large if somewhat dated. Clearly people smoke in the hotel which obviously is a Japan wide issue, but the Westin does a good job of trying to mask it. Turn down service is erratic, done one night and then not the next. Breakfast is comprehensive with something for every taste, but the line during the weekend was huge and it took 25 minutes to be seated (staff not coping well) - fine on weekdays. Doormen very helpful and friendly and helped with taxis.",3,2015/08/04
2,REDACTED,en,3695,"I stayed at The Westin Tokyo for six nights for work. The hotel is in a good location within walking distance to the Ebisu station on the Hibiya Line (Gray Line) and the JR East line; you can walk from the basement of the hotel through a covered walkway and a mall to both of the lines. It's about 10 minutes and I found it very convenient.

WiFi connection was included and the signal was strong and consistent. I also had breakfast included. The breakfast is nice, with a variety of eastern and western -style food. The only issue is that there could be a wait during busy mornings. I was also there during tourist season, and there's very little a business traveler can do to rush someone on vacation.

The room was nice, clean, and comfortable. My critique is that the room is dated -- dark walls, furnishing, and lighting. I was in a non-smoking room and there was a night when clearly someone was smoking. The room is, however, a nice sized room with good amenities. 

The staff was unfailingly polite and with the exception of the concierge (who clearly was bored and rather be somewhere else), I enjoyed my interactions with the staff. They all spoke English well, and were polite to a foreigner awkwardly thanking them in Japanese.

A taxi to the hotel from Haneda Airport will cost around US$80.

Overall, I would recommend this hotel to a business traveler and tourists. It is convenient, comfortable, clean, and the staff is great.",4,2015/08/03
2,REDACTED,en,3696,"The staff was very helpful and made our stay very nice. We reserved a 2 bed room for three people and thought we were getting queen beds but the beds are more like lager twin beds so the recommended a roll away bed when we checked in. This was fine and fit in the room nicely. Beds are very hard and flat but I am told that is topical in ajapan. No heavenly bed at this Westin. The room was larger than I expected with a nice sized bathroom with a separate shower and tub. 
We used the concierge several times and she was weary helpful. The service express staff also provided directions and airport transportation reservations. 
Workout room was very hot and did not have good airflow. If you are a runner it's not the best Westin workout room. The room directory says that they have a pool available at a vocal health club. We were issued passes from the concierge (you cannot use the pool if you have a tattoo). We walked over to the club. We had to fill out a form including our blood type. The club desk person explained the rules including that we were required to were bathing caps. We both have very short hair. It's an indoor lap pool. Not worth the trouble. 
We ate at the hotel restraint for breakfast which was wonderful but very expensive. It's a buffet and we don't eat that much food. Starbucks across the street is a better choice. 
Location of the hotel was great, near the subway station, restraints and shopping.",4,2015/08/02
2,REDACTED,en,3697,I didn't want to stay in Shibuya or Shinjuku...too touristy. My friends who live in Tokyo recommended Ebisu and this was the only hotel we could book on such short notice in that area. But we loved it. It was comfortable and close to the train. Having people who spoke english there was comforting when we needed help acclimating ourselves with Tokyo. It was walking distance to my favorite ramen restaurant and a 7-11 for cash withdrawals.,4,2015/07/27
2,REDACTED,en,3698,The location is a little beyond where I would stay typically because I like to be in the center ( or close to) the action but this hotel was worth it! We stayed here on our last night of vacation and figured we would spoil our selfs a bit. The hotel is stunning and the service is fantastic! Our room was HUGE and the king size bed felt like heaven! The area restaurants and shopping are great and it's a short walk from the subway station.You should do yourself a favor and stay here at least once!,5,2015/07/25
2,REDACTED,en,3699,This is a luxury hotel for those who come for business. The room is quite big for Japanese standard and it has a beautiful lobby. The Ebisu train station is only walking distance and there are plenty of restaurants near the hotel.

Hotel not really suitable for famiywith children as they dont have children facilities,4,2015/07/23
2,REDACTED,en,3700,"The Westin was a beautiful hotel in a peaceful part of town. This definitely isn't the place to stay if you're looking for a party, but if you'd like to be well taken care of in a beautiful setting I'd highly recommend the Westin.

The staff was there to answer any request, the food on site was pretty tasty, and the room was wonderful.

Within walking distance are several bars and restaurants, but the area seemed to skew towards family and business people.",5,2015/07/22
2,REDACTED,en,3701,Our family of four stayed in 2 connecting non-smoking rooms in June 2015. The rooms were nicely appointed and very clean. 7-10 minute walk from the Ebisu Station and in a quiet neighborhood but still close to some decent restaurants. Service was impeccable. We asked a doorman for a restaurant recommendation and he made sure that we knew where we were headed by giving us exact directions on a local map - in perfect English! Only reason for not giving it the excellent rating is because our rooms still smelled like smoke even though we were in non-smoking rooms and complimentary wifi was not available in our rooms.,4,2015/07/21
2,REDACTED,en,3702,"Been staying in the Westin Tokyo more than 5 years. Surprised with their consistently highly rated maintenance and superb service overall. Room is clean and they do care for details, from time to time one can tell by how they position the shower head so that cold water won't splash on you by surprise to the amenity kits provided. One of the most enjoyable experiences was the breakfast, no matter is in the restaurant or the executive club floor, both have lot of choices and food is very fresh. The bar on the top floor is excellent. Can't go to sleep without visiting it. I will keep coming back every time when I am in town.",5,2015/07/15
2,REDACTED,en,3703,"The Westin Tokyo is a gorgeous hotel, something you'll notice right upon entering the grand lobby. The rooms are quite large, especially for Tokyo standards. Staff and food are both great, though, the hotel's location is a bit of a walk from the nearest train station (around 10 minutes). It's good if you want to be out of the hustle and bustle of the city, but not so convenient for sightseeing or easy access to transportation.",4,2015/07/14
2,REDACTED,en,3704,"Originally I was torn between booking this property and the Park Hyatt, but I know I made the right decision! This hotel was spectacular! 

The bellmen were all very friendly and helpful and check-in was efficient and quick.

As an SPG Platinum member I received a wonderful suite upgrade on the 19th floor! There was a lovely dry-fruit and nut platter in our room as a welcome gift! The room was very spacious with 2 bathrooms, a bar area and a nice living room. Views from the suite were gorgeous particularly at night. The main bathroom had double sinks and a super hi-tech toilet with the Japanese washlet and a heated seat! There was a separate shower and bathtub which we very much appreciated. 

Toiletries (they had my favorite- L’Occitane!) were VERY well stocked with extra's of everything ranging from lots of extra towels to shavers, combs and toothbrushes. Plenty of complementary water restocked in the room twice daily and turndown service in the evening with fresh ice brought to the room. They even sent little pajamas and tiny slippers to the room for my little son as well as a Westin care-pack for him with a bag, hat coloring book etc. Other hotels can take a lesson from this one about service and getting the details right!

I think it's the attention to all the little details like these that distinguish a good hotel from a fabulous hotel!

There is a club lounge on the 17th floor which serves beverages throughout the day and breakfast in the morning & cocktails and a nice spread in the evenings. This is a great place to relax with a cold drink after a busy day!

SPG platinum members are allowed access to the club lounge in addition to breakfast in the hotels main restaurant. 

Breakfast in the Terrace restaurant is fabulous and the spread is over-the-top amazing! The fresh squeezed juice is the best and the buffet is wonderfully vast catering to both local and western pallets! The lox is the freshest too :) Every kind of pastry imaginable is at the buffet!

One of the hotels best gems is head Chef Daniel Jaeger. He truly makes the restaurant an amazing dining experience making sure it is run to his high expectations, all the while ensuring that guests are enjoying and having a wonderfully memorable time! He went out of his way to ensure my little son had a fabulous experience. Every morning my son was so excited to go to breakfast to say hi to the chef again! I could see other excited guests also thrilled by the chef taking the time to talk to them and make sure everything was perfect! It's memories like that, that stay with guests long after they leave a hotel!

This hotel operates on the highest level and we will return the next time we are in Tokyo!

Pros: 
- Good location - Less than a 10 minute walk to the JR line and across from the Mitsokhoshi Center. Quiet location in the Ebisu area.
- Friendly customer service.
- Clean rooms and comfy beds. Provided all the necessary amenities during our stay. 
- Daily bus transportation to and from the Narita Airport (with a fee).

Cons:
- Free wifi available in the lobby. 
- Rooms had older decor with gold trimmings and gold columns.

2,REDACTED,en,3710,"Lovely hotel, kind and helpful staff. Well located close to restaurants, shopping and the subway. Very comfortable beds. The room was nice and large. We had two beds, but I would say they were only NA double sized, not queen, which was common, we found, in travelling in Japan.",5,2015/07/06
2,REDACTED,en,3711,"I had researched quite a few hotels before booking the Westin. I wanted a hotel that worked well for a family (2 adults, 2 teens). The Westin worked out perfect for us. We booked two adjoining rooms. We were able to open both doors to have a shared space. The rooms were quite large for Tokyo standards. It was nice to have some extra space after a long day of sightseeing. 

Breakfast was included in our room rate. The buffet was great. I had read a few negative reviews about the buffet but I thought it was great. There was a large selection of food and we did not have any issues waiting. We ate on the earlier side though (e.g. before 8am).

The location, worked well for us. The walk to the JR Ebisu station was less than a 10 minute walk via the Skywalk. The station is on the Yamonote line which was very convenient for sightseeing. The first night we grabbed a quick meal in the basement of the Mitsukoshi dept store across the street from the hotel. We also went there for an easy lunch the day we left before heading to the airport. The kids thought that the food court area was pretty cool! I would recommend stopping there at least once during the trip for a quick and relatively cheap meal. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends traveling with families, especially older kids/teens",5,2015/07/05
2,REDACTED,en,3712,"Located a 7 min walk from Ebisu station it is easy to explore Tokyo using the rail system from this hotel. Variety of restaurants in walking distance as well. The hotel allows access to the fitness facility in the Ebisu complex which is very nice. Lounge is nice, but suggest going for the breakfast downstairs, much more selection. Make sure to take a walk around the beautiful garden!",5,2015/07/04
2,REDACTED,en,3713,"The Westin Tokyo stands atop of the central, and easily accessible area of Ebisu in Tokyo, within easy reach by Taxi or Train to any part of Tokyo and an ideal landing spot. The moment you arrive you are welcomed by heritage with a glossy Horse Drawn Carriage at the entry as the doormen warmly greet you as you glide into the marble adorned foyer and make your way to check in. The hotels lobby is grand, classic and elegant. 

Large open communal spaces with a great cocktail bar tucked away in the corner that maintains that sense of style. 

Making your way to the room the Westin Brand is well represented, but seems that this Westin Hotel does miss some of the more well known elements that the brand is so famed for. This property does not have the Westin Bed (or so it seemed) and also lacked the pillow variety for comfort, so made good use of the cushions inside the room to fluff up the otherwise thin pillow offering. Connecting to the Wifi in the room was both irritating and hindrance as it seems to stop, start, stick and casually roll through. Seems that the common areas delivers a solid Wifi connectivity, but the rooms lacked the ability to work solidly without interruption.

While the Wifi was a let down, don't let that impact the choice of the property. All areas of the hotel, including the oversized room, ambiance, facilities and stylish vibe made it a good hotel within easy reach of the city heartland.

Would i stay there again, perhaps not, tokyo is an ever evolving city and hotel offerings are always staying ahead of the curb and so when you consider that Tokyo hotels are often at the +$250 per night, as the Westin is, you would expect more and not to have to pardon let downs.",3,2015/07/01
2,REDACTED,en,3714,"I recently stayed in The Westin Tokyo for 9 nights for business/leisure. The hotel is located next to our office (Ebisu Garden Plaza) which makes commuting easy. 

The hotel's decoration is old fashion but the service is fantastic from checked-in to checked-out. I was always greeted with a smile from the service staffs and my request for late checked-out was duly met. The room is huge and there is bath tub and standing shower in the room. Bottled water was available too. Air-condition is great but TV channels are limited. I wish there are more movie channels. 
I ordered room service in one of the nights and the food was wonderful. Breakfast stays mostly the same throughout my stay and i got sick after a while. The spread is above average. There is a starbucks in Ebisu Garden Place (which is just 2 mins next to The Westin) so you don't have to worry about your coffee fix.

The Westin is located about 10 mins away from Ebisu Station. Once you exit the station you turn right and you will see the skyway. At the end of the skyway is where you exit the station, cross the road and you'll see Ebisu Garden Place. Westin is at the end of this building. Atre mall is located above the station and there are many restaurants at the upper levels. I tried about four restaurants and they were all great. There is also a local supermarket, Muji and Franc Franc in Atre Mall. If you walk past this mall to the other side of the station, you will see the famous Ebisu Food Alley. It is where you rub shoulders with salary-man as there are many izakayas in the alley.Unfortunately I only discovered the alley the night before I left so I only managed to try one restaurant.

It is also possible to walk from The Westin to Daikanyama but I didn't try the walk. i was told it was about 20 mins walk. The hotel also offers airport limosine service. There is a counter at the concierge area where they can take care of your delivery should you purchase big items.

The Westin might not be located in the touristy area but at the end of the day after my shopping I am glad to return to this area which offers peace and calm.",5,2015/07/01
2,REDACTED,en,3715,"This is a very convenient hotel for exploring Tokyo, and I'd recommend it for people visiting the city for the first time. Yebisu isn't quite as busy as some of the other districts in Tokyo, but there are plenty of restaurants that are open late, some of which are English-friendly. The hotel is distinctly Japanese, but as a Western chain hotel, there are still plenty of amenities that make the transition a little smoother than I've experienced at other hotels in Tokyo. The hotel itself has plenty of restaurants with English menus, which is relieving on that first night after the long trip to Japan. Service here was typically excellent with very good English spoken by every member of staff I spoke with. 

The hotel is reasonably well located for subway access. It's about a ten-minute walk to Ebisu station, but you can do that entire walk on flat surfaces by going to the B1 (basement) level of the hotel and walking through the Yebisu Garden plaza and following the signs. Much of the walk is on moving walkaways. On the way back from Ebisu station, follow the signs off the platform for the East Exit and you'll see signs for the Westin as you're heading up the first escalator (and on all the subsequent signage as well). The plaza has a small pharmacy that was useful for picking up drinks. 

While not up to the lofty standards of some of the other hotels in Tokyo, this was a comfortable hotel, and one I'd recommend.",4,2015/06/28
2,REDACTED,en,3716,"Wonderful hotel, wonderful, attentive service, excellent location in Esibu, close the the train station with plenty of useful stores and restaurants around, I would have given it five stars but for the smoking. Apparently it's ok to smoke in public places in Japan and so the beautiful bar and restaurant on the top floor were full of cigarettes smoke and the hallways smelled of cigarettes and even the linen in our beautiful (non smoking) room smelled the same. If you smoke or don't mind the smell (and health implications) it's perfect but I had trouble dealing with it. On the other hand I don't know if you can find a smoke free hotel in Tokyo.",4,2015/06/24
2,REDACTED,en,3717,"The service was excellent and the hotel bar makes a delicious cocktail. We had no complaints about our stay during the cherry blossom season this year.

The hotel is some 10-15 minutes away from the subway and JR station. There is a walkway shortcut that lets you get there in under 10 minutes if you walk fast. This may seem convenient, but we have stayed at other hotels in Tokyo where the station is just around the corner or down the street. It is tiring coming back after a day of shopping/sightseeing and having to walk another 10 minutes or so to get to the hotel.

That being said, the area around the hotel is nice with good restaurants (ramen and ice cream!) close to the hotel.",4,2015/06/22

If you can get a room higher up, with a view, go for it, as the Tokyo skyline is lovely to see from the hotel. The rooms were very reasonably priced (the restaurants, less so). The subway system is easily accessible, although it takes around 10-15 minutes to walk there (one can use electric walkways to reduce the actual walking, if needed",5,2015/06/22
2,REDACTED,en,3719,"Stayed here for a week on a business trip.

Staff are excellent, rooms are good and the location is good, however there are a few irks that stop it being excellent.

Firstly, they charge for wifi which in this day and age is criminal, it's not exactly cheap either (1500JPY a day), don't be fooled by the free wifi claims - that's only if your a member of their business reward club.

Secondly, the breakfast restaurant is not big enough for the size of the hotel which means you will likely end up queuing for you morning meal. Also, for some reason with me they had a blind spot for tea, each time I asked they forgot - longest wait for a cup of tea was over 25 minutes - not really acceptable.

Thirdly, none of the restaurants are open late (even the bar stops serving food before 23:00) so the only option is room service and the menu is very limited - I've had my fill of triple decker sandwiches!

I did enjoy my stay but these minor inconveniences stop it getting 5 stars.",4,2015/06/21
2,REDACTED,en,3720,"Stayed here for workshop and found this hotel located strategically 15 minutes away from Ebisu train station. The overall deco of this hotel is based around 18th century French deco which wasn't my fancy. 
I must give credit to the excellent customer service experience from check in to house keeping and concierge service..two thumbs up. 
The breakfast selection could have been better as I expected more choices from this property. Nonetheless if you stay here on Sunday I would recommend to try their breakfast at Mai restaurant which serves authentic Japanese breakfast set meals only available on Sunday's.

2,REDACTED,en,3721,"I had another great stay at the Westin Tokyo. This time I stayed for 24 days. I never feel like I am stuck at a hotel on business here because of the service, staff and location of this property. This place is kind of like a second home to me now.

Chef Danial Jager had a bunch of new vegan and gluten free dishes catered to my tastes once again, including a fabulous spicy arribiata pasta. Hat’s off to him again.

As usual, I really enjoyed the Executive Lounge and the use of the Yebisu Garden Place gym that you get as a guest at the Westin Tokyo. (See my last review of this hotel for more on all this.)

I finally had the chance to go to the Compass Rose Sky Lounge on the top floor, which is a nice place for drink before going out for dinner.

One small complaint is that the service was painfully slow a couple of times in the lobby bar (in the rotunda lobby area). It really wasn’t busy either of these times and I got the sense that we were being ignored because I saw the waiters serving other guests frequently. I didn’t bother to mention this to management as I forgot about it at the time.

I will be back for what I hope will be another great stay very soon!",5,2015/06/13
2,REDACTED,en,3722,"We stayed at the Westin Tokyo for three days. It is in Ebisu, which is in a quiet, higher end area. The rooms were very spacious, clean, and luxurious like most Westins. The rooms had supplies of disposable toothbrushes, razors, Q-tips and other toiletries, which was convenient. The staff was very courteous and friendly. The breakfast buffet was simply amazing. The area near the first floor restaurant sells absolutely beautiful pastries. 

The location is in a very quiet area, and is a fair walk to the train station. There are people movers along the way and the train station had a number of decent shops and restaurants. If have have a family with young children, the distance to the train station might be slightly too far, but for any other type of situation it should be fine.",5,2015/06/11
2,REDACTED,en,3723,"Stayed in this hotel as we travelled during the Cherry blossom period and our usual Tokyo hotel in Shinjuku was fully booked. We arrived in Shinjuku train station from Osaka on the bullet train. Easier to take taxi from station as the hotel is a few stations away unless you are travelling with light luggage. You certainly would not want to carry your heavy luggage up and down the escalators.
We arrived about an hour before check in time which is 3pm.and was ushered to the check in counter, the staff was efficient but not the usual friendly welcome you receive in Japanese hotel especially a five star hotel. We waited in the sitting area by the reception and then taken to our rooms. The whole environment of the hotel was quite cold an uninviting , everywhere is goldy and black with period furniture. (quite a haunting feeling in the corridors ! )
The rooms were comfortable with all the usual bathroom enmities and clean. Breakfast was ok with western and Japanese selection but quite busy and not a place were you can have a leisurely breakfast.
The plus point for the hotel is that it has a covered walk from the hotel to the subway which is convenient when the weather is wet. Across the hotel is a big open courtyard which is quite lovely to sit out when the weather is fine. Also there are cafes and shops around the square which are quite nice to browse. The hotel is quite popular for weddings where there is a horse and carriage plus a footman with top and tails to make the wedding more ""European "" ! to take the bride and groom for a ride and then back to the hotel for their reception. 
We stayed here for four nights and I felt that was quite nice but not as impressive as some of the hotels I stayed in Japan. However the hotel has a beautiful garden beside the hotel.",3,2015/06/08

But, for the remainder of my 9 day stay, front desk, concierge and bell boy were among the best experiences in the hotel. As are the rooms, large, with all comfort, good beds , very good housekeeping, the amenities, particularly the products are to low quality. The 22nd floor bar is a rip-off, the bar not that nice, quantity of a shot near illegal, but the bar in the lobby is good. 
In japan, I rearly eat at hotel restaurants and I did not this time either, my wife did not use the spa as she felt the products used are of inferior quality.

My company is based in Shinjuku, but as an SPG Platinum, I choose to stay at a Starwood property (which requires a trip on JR Yamanote line to get to Shinjuku). There is about a 10 min walk to the train station using the moving sidewalk. Many nice restaurants and shopping at Yebisu Garden Place across the street. As a plat, upgraded to club floor always and twice to a 2 bedroom suite. Breakfast and evening hors d'oeuvres/drinks in club lounge is tasty and convenient; however, I tend to do breakfast in the lobby level restaurant due to the wider variety of choices which include Japanese, European, and American selections. Their buffets at breakfast, lunch, and Sunday brunch are very well done with excellent quality, although pricey (as are all restaurants in hotel). Rooms and bed are comfortable and service is very gracious by all the staff. The hotel decorates beautifully for the holidays, including western Easter and Christmas. I enjoy staying here and recommend to other visitors from the U.S.",4,2015/06/05
2,REDACTED,en,3727,I loved this hotel which was close to many places in Tokyo yet still a bit out of the hubbub of the city. The staff was amazing and a short walk to Ebisu Station and you are only one stop from Shibuya and the Yamanote line runs to many of the major sites in Tokyo.,5,2015/06/04
2,REDACTED,en,3728,"We stayed in a beautiful room with two double beds which was perfect for us - 2 adults and 2 children aged 8 and 11. We had a fantastic view of the city and the Tokyo Tower. It was all very clean and comfortable. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. We had a delicious breakfast buffet the first day with fresh fruit and juice, numerous pastries to choose from, omelettes and all sorts of Japanese and American hot breakfast options. However, unsurprisingly, it was quite expensive so we chose to sort breakfast ourselves the other days. A good location, near a tube stop and easy to get to east or west of city from there. It was a lovely few days of luxury at the end of a busy 2 weeks of sightseeing.",5,2015/06/03
2,REDACTED,en,3729,"This is a very old-fashioned looking hotel (ie, the decor is out of date), but don't let that fool you. The service is excellent -- friendly and of course polite. The room has a different layout to the traditional narrow corridor-like space -- there is a bend to the room so it breaks up the space nicely. The hotel is also in a good location - near a mall and a couple of cool neighborhoods with excellent artisanal/hipster cafes (the kind that roast their own beans and do drip coffees). It's also close to a well-connected subway station (Yebisu) that has a lot of eateries. It's also near the Tokyo Metropolitan Photography Museum (though closed for renovation during my trip) and the Yebisu Beer Brewery Museum.",4,2015/06/02
2,REDACTED,en,3730,"Excellent service on the executive floor.
Nice rooms with all the comfort you need.
Good location in a nice part of Tokyo.
Good choice at breakfast and splendid view from the room and the lounge.
Professionally approach.",4,2015/06/01
2,REDACTED,en,3731,"Had a great stay at this hotel. The classic modern rooms are spacious and comfortable. Mine had a view of the city and at night you could see the Tokyo Tower all lit up. The very large bathrooms had separate showers and tubs. The lobby is very airy with a large staircase leading up to two restaurants on the mezzanine level. Plus, there is a garden right in the hotel property.

The Japanese steak restaurant on the top floor is expensive but well worth it. There is also a well-equipped gym open 24/7. An adjacent mall offers a Mitsukoshi department store, small stores and some restaurants (try the tower restaurants at Yebisu Place). Of course you can walk to area near Yebisu station for a wider choice of restaurants. The downside is that the hotel is a distance away from the centre (Imperial Palace, Ginza, etc.)",4,2015/06/01
2,REDACTED,en,3732,"Only a few train rides away from the airport. Plenty of restaurants and shopping around the hotel area. Beautifully located for those who want to be away from the hustle of downtown traffic. Located in the Ebisu Garden Place. Plenty of great shopping just inside the metro area, with several floors to walk around. 
Very important recommendation: If traveling via the train, follow the directions through the metro area on the walkways, BUT instead of going outside and walking through the park area where the roadway is not even and you will encounter many steps, it's best to make a right after the last walkway, by the information booth inside the terminal and take the escalator downstairs to a nice, even walk to the end of the tunnel to your Westin.",4,2015/05/29
2,REDACTED,en,3733,"I always stay here in Tokyo, There is nothing negative one can say unless it is not near where you wish to do business. The hotel is simply beautiful, the rooms are especially comfortable and roomy and if you are on the executive floors, the lounge is a wonderful place to meet for business breakfast or afternoon chat.",5,2015/05/26
2,REDACTED,en,3734,"We stayed as a family and had a great experience. The entire staff was immensely helpful and friendly. The concierge was always providing us with great advice and help on how to get to our intended destinations. 

The rooms were of decent size and the bathrooms were modern and upgraded. 

The nearest train station (Ebisu) is about 5-10 mins walk; not bad of a walk as you have to go through Ebisu plaza, then to the skywalk, to the train station.

If I were to come back to Tokyo again, this would be one of the places that I would stay at again.",5,2015/05/25
2,REDACTED,en,3735,An exquisite hotel in a very central location. There are many things to see in walking distance or a short stop away on the subway such as the Shinagawa crossing. The service at the hotel was impeccable and the room had the most awesome view of The Tokyo Skytree tower. I definitely recommend this property. I will be staying here on my next trip to Tokyo.,5,2015/05/24
2,REDACTED,en,3736,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here especially the ""old school"" aspects.The location while not central was so who very convenient and the hotel itself provided everything we needed to get around.The rooms were spacious and immaculate while the Club Lounge provided everything it should.My only complaint would be that the bed was the least heavenly of the heavenly beds I have experienced at Westin around the world.Also evening food presmtTions at the club were meager and not of high quality.All in all though our stay was wonderful and we would return happily.",4,2015/05/23
2,REDACTED,en,3737,"after a long tiring journey from the USA it was nice to arrive at this hotel. The lobby is very opulent and welcomes you in. The rooms have been described as dated but we found them to have a nice Art Deco feel. Not the best buds by Westin USA standards, but comfortable enough. The view from the 13 th floor was very nice, no room noise at all. Prices for food here are very high, but the quality is also, service is Japanese ( which means perfect) The location is a matter of preference, it's not in the busy downtown area ,but the subway is close by ( 15 minutes walk) and that will do. Right across the street you will find a very next nice mall, lots of upscale dining and shopping.",5,2015/05/23
2,REDACTED,en,3738,"You would struggle to find fault with this hotel. Public areas and rooms alike were excellent and the Japanese ""matter of fact"" service puts most other nations to shame! Fantastic breakfast and we also ate in The Bar (excellent) and Yebisu (excellent...but expensive!). For those that want peace and quiet, the hotel is perfect, but has the feel of being in the middle of a housing estate. Not much nearby, but Shibuya and Roppongi Hills are a short taxi ride away. MRT station is about a 10 minute walk.
We did get some bad advice from the Concierge, but that could be my terrible Japanese. For example, we asked for a lively bar near the hotel and were sent to a ""locals"" bar in the middle of a housing estate -- disappointing when there is more nightlife in Tokyo than you could ever experience in a life time.
This is a great hotel, unless you want to walk straight onto the busy streets of Tokyo, which I did!",4,2015/05/19
2,REDACTED,en,3739,"Very nice hotel. 

Rooms were a bit dated but very spacious. Be sure to request a room with a view if you are on a high floor, the view is really nice. 

Service was very good, very efficient check in. Breakfast could be better, lines got long during the peak hours. My only real gripe is they wanted to charge me full standard rate for a guaranteed early check in, not only could they not offer half rate, their charge was 50% more than their own website!

The location is not that near to the train station but there is a nice park right in front with dining options. 

Runners, be sure to get a jogging map and make your way to the river, if timed in the spring, running under cherry blossoms will be a great experience.",4,2015/05/19
2,REDACTED,en,3740,"The Westin is in an ideal location to explore Japan, just a short stroll from Ebisu station on the highly efficient JR Yamanote Line which takes you close to all the city's main attractions. Our room had a great view across the city and was spacious and well equipped. Breakfast is about £20 but it is still good value by international hotel standards.",5,2015/05/18
2,REDACTED,en,3741,"Very close to Ebisu Station. Great staff! Away from bustling city center but with easy train access. Do not miss a walk through the garden. Tepan restaurant was great, but very pricy. Worth the splurge. Rooms are roomy but ALL beds in all Japan hotels are firmer than USA beds. Great shopping complex with many levels with access from hotel.",5,2015/05/14
2,REDACTED,en,3742,"My stay here was fine. I paid about $34 to upgrade to the Executive floor, which I found worth it for what I paid. 

Check-in: Check-in was professional and prompt. 

Room: My room was fine. The beds were twin-sized, which was disappointing. I slept fine. There was a large flat-screen television in the room, which I didn't use. Despite others' experience, I found the wi-fi to be fine speed-wise - it comes complimentary as part of the Executive package. My major complaint about the room was the AC system -- it took forever to cool down the room. There were slippers provided in the closet, which I used. Coffee, and 2 bottles of water were provided in the room as part of the Executive package. The room featured great views of the city and the drapes did a good job of blacking out the light. I could hear some noise, despite being on a high floor, throughout the night from the construction project below and the continual trains passing by. The bathroom featured the Westin Heavenly shower - which was great -- it featured 2 types of shower heads! There was also a large-size bathtub, which I used and found to be quite relaxing! The bathroom amenities are plentiful, and include toothbrushes, razor and shaving gel, mouthwash, body wash, lotion, and of course soap, shampoo, and conditioner. 

Lounge: The lounge itself was pretty disappointing, and not nearly on par with lounges of similar hotels in Asia. There is a ""happy hour"" that only lasts 2 hours and features several types of alcohol. Once the ""happy hour"" is over, the alcohol is removed. Service was also lacking and not on par with other Executive Lounges. The buffet and happy hour features a few items, though probably not enough to sub for dinner. I didn't go to the lounge for breakfast - as an Executive Lounge guest, I opted for the Terrace Restaurant instead, which is included with the Executive package (see separate review: cliff notes - I was quite happy and would recommend)! 

Area: As others noted, the Ebisu subway station (on the Yamanote line) is an easy 10 minute walk away via the Ebisu Garden sky walk (a series of moving walkways). You are one stop away on the subway from the hip Shibuya area. At the Shibuya station, you can connect to other lines, and namely the Narita Express Train, which takes you to the Tokyo-Narita airport (takes about 75 minutes) for around 3050 yen. There is also a bus that departs to both airports right from the front door of the hotel, though it is quite a bit slower than the Express Trains. 

Also in the immediate area, one will find numerous restaurants, shops, a large department store (think something like Macy's or Harrods's), a pharmacy, and several fast food restaurants (and of course, the obligatory Starbuck's!). There are Michelin 2 and 3 stared Joel Robuchon restaurants right across the street, too. 

Overall, my stay here was fine. I found the service to be missing that special ""something"" that other hotels in Asia at the similar price point and star level are able to offer. I would stay here again, though, when the need arises.",4,2015/05/14
2,REDACTED,en,3743,"The Ebisu Garden Place is very large shopping complex, just across the street from the hotel. You feel like you are in a suburb. But from the Ebisu complex, you can catch access to the Tokyo subway and trains. The hotel has very nice rooms and is a welcoming spot for international tourists.",5,2015/05/10
2,REDACTED,en,3744,"This hotel needs some updating when comparing it to other places we stayed for cheaper in Tokyo. Also, I felt the location is a little far from most tourist places. There is really no where you can walk to. It is about a 10 minute walk from the closest subway. Also, internet is not included. It seemed like we paid a lot of very sub-par service. The lobby has a very strong perfume smell that gave me an instant migraine! Also, even with an upgrade of a city view, there was not really much to see. I wasn't to impressed with this hotel and it did not match the other experiences we had in tokyo- modern, funky, fun.",3,2015/05/07
2,REDACTED,en,3745,"I had a flawless stay here. I ended up staying an extra 2 nights because i enjoyed it so much. 

Stayed in room 912 which has a great view over the city. 

Ai and Satoshi on the front desk were some of the best staff i've ever met at any hotel, anywhere in the world. 5 star staff.

I nearly only gave the hotel 4 stars, but the only thing that was not excellent is the room being a little dated. 

The bath was very large for Japan, i'm 6'2! The bathroom is quite luxurious.

The breakfast buffet was cracking and worth the 2500 yen.

Hotel is in Ebisu which for me is the best spot in Tokyo. 

You can walk to Daikanyama and Nakameguro which are 2 incredible areas. They're filled with restaurants, bars and shops that will keep you entertained for weeks. Shibuya is a slightly longer walk, but Ebisu station is only one stop on the train. Taxi home from Shibuya costs around 1500 yen.",5,2015/05/05
2,REDACTED,en,3746,"I stayed at The Westin Tokyo for a week and enjoyed the great hospitality of the Associates. I must confess I was GM of this great hotel 10 years ago and it made me proud and pleased that a few associates are still there and some of the changes I initiated are still working very well. I stayed in the Club Floor and enjoyed Club privileges - one think I was not happy with was the slowness of the Internet service - in Tokyo one expects it to be fast. The Tepanyaki restaurant and the Chinese restaurant still provide a great Quality of food. The newly renovated Terrace has a bigger variety of Breakfast items - and also includes freshly pressed juices and Smoothies and lot's of Superfood items - Chef Daniel has a nice rapport with non Japanese customers which helps - Also tried Victor's the fine dining and had good set luncheon menu - still a very busy hotel with weddings, I counted 11 and a nice touch with the carriage for wedding couples to arrive in style - well done",5,2015/05/05

2,REDACTED,en,3749,"The Westin Tokyo lived up to the Starwood Westin image as a safe, quality and luxury hotel. Its classic decor and ambient makes one feel at home and created the comfortableness for one to look forward to coming back for a good and pamper rest. Service was professional and mature. You know that you are in safe and dependable hands. Room was of average size, yet comfortable and well equipped. The nearest subway station is Ebisu station which is a good 15-20 min walk away. However, it is located in a very charming neighborhood that one don't feel the denseness and rush of the city center. There are quite a lot of lovely eateries nearby and easy access to shopping. Breakfast spread was extensive and quality of food was good. However, the breakfast restaurant was too small to accommodate the house guests during my stay. Some guests had to be seated at the adjacent lounge. The next time I come, I hope to see is a little more smile and friendliness from the staff at the reception and the concierge - it will help create many more exceptional stay for many of its guests.",4,2015/04/27

Located in one of Tokyo's chic Prefectures, it commands a location just a small distance from Ginza, the up market shopping area with great stores and even better restaurants. We arrived from Europe on Christmas Eve for a perfect 5 day stay.Comfortable, clean and quiet rooms and the staff are always eager to assist. I even required some medication and the hotel went out of their way to provide me with this even without charge. The food is top class in both restaurants we tried. Will definitely be returning.",5,2015/04/22

The room decor is a little bit outdated but it's very clean and the beds comfortable.

The lounge offered a good view of the city. The food selection wasn't so great but what's on offer the food tasted good. 

A very good selection of both western and Japanese foods for breakfast.",4,2015/04/20

2,REDACTED,en,3755,"We were in Japan for our honeymoon over a course of three weeks and were lucky to see most of the country so we were limited as to how long we can spend in each city. We had booked the Westin Tokyo for two nights and from the check in to the departure the staff were very helpful and courteous. We arrived early so could not check in straight away so we had time to catch a baseball game while our luggage was stored securely with the bellmen. They even gave us a complimentary umbrella for the rainy day. Good, strong umbrellas, that don't break on you in the wind, so that was much appreciated. That evening we had an impeccable dinner at the Yebisu Restaurant located on the 22nd floor, pricy, but then again, if you pay top money for quality service and food, it is to be expected and the team there duly delivered. We liked how after you finish your entrée, you are re seated in another part of the restaurant to enjoy dessert and coffee. 

The hotel was informed of our honeymoon and while the hotel was running on near full occupancy they gave us a beautiful deluxe room on the 11th floor with a fantastic view of the Tokyo Tower. Within a few moments of settling in, an agent came to the door with a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine from the management congratulating us on this special occasion. 

all in all a memorable stay at the Westin Tokyo. We only wish we had more time to enjoy the hotel. From the experience we had, it was just as expected from a Westin and Starwood property. First class all the way from a world class brand....",5,2015/04/19
2,REDACTED,en,3756,"Stayed for four nights in two adjoining rooms. First night we could not have adjoining so they upgraded is to Platinum floor for remaining nights with breakfast buffet which was amazing. 

Train station is a short ten minute walk away that then gets you to almost anywhere in Tokyo in 30 minutes. Most spots such as Shibuya and Shinjuku are just a 5 or ten minute ride. 

Large rooms with big baths, well maintained. Concierge staff is exceptional and use them. FYI they will not accept tips. Are service experience with the rest of the staff was also excellent.",5,2015/04/18
2,REDACTED,en,3757,"This was my first time in Tokyo so maybe my expectations were too high but the room looked like something from the early 90's in Las Vegas. The room was clean, acceptable noise level, spacious and had a beautiful view - I had an executive suite. I had the included breakfast which was fine but nothing to write home about except the views from the 17th floor were beautiful. Definitely skip the first floor restaurant.",3,2015/04/12
2,REDACTED,en,3758,"We stayed here for 8 nights - one night when we first arrived in Japan and then 7 more nights after we came back from a week-long JR pass trip. The hotel kept our big luggage during the course of our trip and it was in a room, waiting for us, by the time we checked in again. Service is impeccable. Staff is excruciatingly polite and considerate. Housekeeping even mended a couple of buttons for us (fell off my coat) free of charge, for which I was very grateful. Lounge is spacious and has great views. If you are a platinum member, go down to the Terrace (instead of the Lounge) for breakfast. Much better selection.

Nearby the Station there are many restaurants, which are popular with the locals and can be crowded on weekends. It is also a short distance (by taxi) to Meguro River. The breakfast spread is very good with freshly squeezed orange juice right infront of you. The rooms are nicely sized and the view our room faces the beautiful Sky Tree. The location of this hotel can be further improved if the hotel provides free shuttle to the station which is great when its raining, during the cold weather or when you have finished shopping！",4,2015/04/11
2,REDACTED,en,3762,"We stayed in a charming double room facing the Ebisu Garden Palace with a wonderful classical layout (including a dressing table) and beautifully decorated bathroom. There was no shortage of in-room amenities in the bathroom; the amenity draw was stocked with everything that a normal guest might require. As noted by other guests, the lack of free in-room WiFi coverage was an annoyance, particularly as there were so few seating areas in the lobby where WiFi could be accessed for free.

The service was almost incredible (except from the lobby dining room team). The Concierge Team were amazing – they responded to every request with a smile and a sense of importance and dedication to complete the tasks we had asked from them.

The breakfast experience was failure and the weakest point of this hotel. We endured a horrible start to every day having to deal with the greeting staff at the lobby dining room; all of whom seemed unable to cope with diners who were booked to stay at the hotel over the Easter weekend. At one point, they had to create a waiting list even through there were empty tables right in front of us. Our booking through booking.com set out that we were to receive a complementary breakfast however each day we faced a constant struggle to convince the dining hall front-desk staff that were entitled to receive breakfast for free. At one point, I went back to my room to retrieve a copy of the booking.com reservation to prove that breakfast was included. When I presented the receipt to the restaurant manageress, she just responded with a shrug and a ‘so what’ glance as if the effort I had made was completely meaningless. 

Had the breakfast experience been better, I would have awarded this hotel with a five-star rating.",4,2015/04/10
2,REDACTED,en,3763,"We stayed 4 nights at the Westin Tokyo while visiting family. We are a family of 5 with children aged 8, 6 and 1. 

While planning this visit, we found it difficult to find a large enough to take all 5 of us. The Westin informed us that we could indeed fit everyone into one of their rooms with 2 oversized single beds and were advised this should work out well. 

With the benefit if hindsight, the beds are really too small for anyone beyond a single decent sized adult. Sure, the rooms are nice, but it sure was cramped. Also, while reasonably close to the Ebisu subway station, it's a bit of a haul with kids to get there. Fortunately one can make it almost the entire way to the subway via a passage/mall connected to the hotel. 

We enjoyed the breakfast buffet each morning, which was well put together with a good variety of both Western and Japanese items. The quality was consistent with what you would expect for a Westin. 

Would we stay here again? Travelling without kids, definitely yes. With kids in tow I think we will explore our options in trying to find a better room setup.",4,2015/04/10
2,REDACTED,en,3764,"Compared to typical Westin hotels in the US, this location will feel a little dated in decor, but the wonderful staff makes up for it. While not 'heavenly' the bed was very comfortable.

Location: about a 10-15 minute walk from Ebisu station (both JR and Tokyo metro lines) via a skywalk that is covered. In fact, even on a rainy day, you can get to either Ebisu stations completely covered. From the Westin, you can get to major Tokyo attractions (Harajuku, Tsukiji, Shinjuku) in 30-40 minutes on average.

Food: Ebisu gardens next to the Westin offers plenty of food options, including Mitsukoshi (department store) with its food court in the basement, and a Burger King for the desperate parents with picky American kids. The possibilities really expand near the Ebisu JR station. Afuri and Ippudo are nearby for ramen. Unlike the Ippudo in NYC, where waiting times can approach 2hrs, we sat down at the Ippudo branch here without waiting. The sixth floor of the Atre 'mall' attached to the JR station has lots of food options as well. A McDonald's and Starbucks are also nearby. 

As SPG member, we got free Wifi, which was reasonably fast and reliable.",4,2015/04/10

This is very different from Sheraton miyako which I just stayed a day earlier where everyone is smiling and friendly. Also there is no platinum upgrade. Service express staffs are generally friendly. But on one occasion, there was a supervisor looking women whom did not even engage in eye contact when I ask about closing hours of shinjuku gyeon garden. She just speak to her female staffs who went to find out information for me. I tried to explain to them that the garden should be open during Sakura blossom but they just look at the computer without eye contact. So service part there is certainly room for improvement. Restaurant is packed too and we have to wait for 5 mins before given a table. Room is spacious but a bit aged. Gym is quite cluttered.

Lots of Restaurants nearby in affordable price. And it's all covered walkway to JR station, although a bit far, l guess around 10 to 12 mins walk. 

There is a Misukoshi Dept Store within 3 mins walking distance and love buying Sushi, Fruits and Beer for late snacks.",5,2015/04/01
2,REDACTED,en,3772,"Overall a good choice of hotel for Tokyo considering its room rate and great service. Rooms were a little old fashioned but a nice enough size. We totally loved the bar at the top of the hotel - Compass Rose. Great service from the bartender and waiters. The location near Ebisu station is very convenient for going to a number of touristy areas such as Roppongi, Shibuya, Shinjuku and even Ginza. We would definitely stay here again on our next trip.",4,2015/03/31
2,REDACTED,en,3773,"Staying at the Westin and it's a nice hotel with a nice selection of restraunts. The rooms are nice and the beds comfortable.
The noise level is normal for a large hotel. The club level lounge is nice and serves a nice breakfast every morning. I would defiantly stay here again.",4,2015/03/31
2,REDACTED,en,3774,"If you want to treat yourself to a few days at a nice hotel, this is the place. It's a short walk from the trendy Ebisu area and Ebisu subway station. The hotel is beautifully appointed alongside a nice garden. It's at the top of a knoll so the views are outstanding. The breakfasts of food from all over the world were delicious. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were roomy and comfortable with plenty of outlets that work for US plugs. The beds were smaller than a normal double, so could be tight to sleep two to a bed. I would definitely recommend the Westin.",5,2015/03/31
2,REDACTED,en,3775,"We stayed here for 6 wonderful nights, the hotel was really beautiful from the reception to the rooms, even the lifts were works of art.
We stayed on the executive floor, breakfast had a dedicated area, beautifully quiet and restful, great food too.
The room was superb, the bed giant, the decor faultless and the view over the city from the window magnificent.
The area is Ebisu and there is every thing you need across the road at the department store or at the railway station which is a short walk away. There is a covered moving walkway which is really great when you are coming home after a long day sightseeing on very tired legs.
There is a limousine bus that leaves from Narita airport and drops you right at the door of the hotel, what could be better.
We loved it all, the hotel, the area and the service from the staff was perfect, we were sorry to leave.",5,2015/03/31
2,REDACTED,en,3776,"Spent five delightful nights at the Westin in Tokyo. The staff were incredibly helpful with everything from dinner reservations to baseball tickets.

It's one of the best SPG properties I have ever stayed in. The lounge was beautiful and breakfast amazing. The internet was blazing fast and the rooms were perfect and absolutely silent, a great's night sleep. I would absolutely stay here again when I visit Tokyo!",5,2015/03/19

2,REDACTED,en,3780,"I am a business traveller and spend 200+ nights per year in hotels across all continents. I based my reviews on my experience witgh all major hotel chains and selected boutique hotels. I am not affiliated as a shareholder, supplier, or otherwise with any of the hotels I review. 

Westin in Ebisu must be one of my favourite hotels in Tokyo next to the Conrad. The rooms may be a bit tacky (think Versace style marble and golden fittings), but the location is great in the center of Ebisu with easy moving walkway access to Ebisu station.

Service has always been great at this hotel and food as well. It is a great way to explore the city from this location and many of my colleagues also prefer it because of the Starwood points. There are Tokyo Hotels with nicer rooms, e.g. Conrad, Grand Hyatt, etc., but I prefer the Westin because of its central and quiet location for both family and business travel. 

Highly recommended.",4,2015/03/17
2,REDACTED,en,3781,"The service at this hotel is totally fabulous, you really feel looked after here. The buffet breakfast is amazing with lots of changes from day to day.

I really enjoyed my stay here.,5,2015/03/12
2,REDACTED,en,3783,"Had everything expected from a 5 star hotel under the Westin brand. Grand lobby, efficient check in, large spacious rooms with plenty of space for clothes and luggage. Good amenities, spotlessly clean, comfortable beds and good size ensuite bathrooms. Peaceful sleep and can open windows up to 10cm for fresh air. Health club small but adequate. Very well layed out buffet breakfast of Asian and western choices. Wifi excellent throughout hotel. Easy walk to Ebisu station (with luggage) that can be completed underground and undercover without difficulty. Will happily stay here again.",5,2015/03/10
2,REDACTED,en,3784,"First time in The Westin Tokyo and I can say, after my time there, this hotel will be my Hotel in Tokyo. Really well communicated.

Everything has been easy and smooth during my time in Tokyo.",5,2015/03/09
2,REDACTED,en,3785,"I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. There is a shuttle bus from NRT airport, though it may take up to 2 hours to get there. Reception staff was friendly and fast. Lobby is gorgeous. Room was clean, very well furnished, looked like brand new. Bathroom is beautiful. I took subway several times, which is around 10 minutes walk from the hotel. It is next to a shopping mall and to a tower, which has Starbucks in case hotel's breakfast is too expensive for you. I wish the nearest subway station was closer, but it was still a very nice stay and I would stay here again.",5,2015/03/07
2,REDACTED,en,3786,"My boyfriend and I stayed here last October during our visit to Tokyo. We loved the Westin! It was extremely convenient, only a short walk from the Ebisu station and very close to several restaurants. There is a really cool covered shopping area across the street that had live music every night during our stay. We were also there during the typhoon last fall and discovered during a downpour that there is a walkway underground from this shopping center that connected to our hotel, so you didn't even have to go outside to get here! The hotel itself was beautiful, with extremely spacious rooms. The breakfast was a nice mix of american and japanese style foods. I would definitely visit this hotel again if we ever make it back to Tokyo.",5,2015/03/07
2,REDACTED,en,3787,"Overview:
Another top notch Westin hotel. Great rooms, well maintained, friendly staff, fully acknowledging Platinum status, good location. The only downside is a small and underequipped gym, which, unfortunately, is a major issue for me. Aside from that, top recommendation. 

Check-in/out & concierge:
Check-in was very fast and professional. My SPG Platinum status was acknowledged and I got upgraded to higher floor room and offered complimentary breakfast. Check-out was speedy and efficient.

Room:
Room was fairly large, featuring the king bed, well maintained and equipped. Iron was brand new, so was the board, Internet was super-fast, bathroom clean and without any glitches.

Breakfast:
I checked out to early to get a breakfast but they did prepare a breakfast package, though it was a bit disappointing (sandwich, water and chips).

Customer Service:
Outstanding. Staff is friendly and responsive. I ordered a room service and delivery was speedy, accurate and food was very good.

Gym
The only real disappointment. Too small, underequipped, would benefit from a total refresh.",4,2015/03/05
2,REDACTED,en,3788,"This hotel feels like a Westin from the late 90s or early 00s, in a comfortably good way. Many venues for eating and drinking, cuisines from around the world are steps away if not inside the hotel itself. Western-style toilet (no electronic bidet sprays, etc.), all the toiletries you'd expect from a Westin in the USA. Staff all speak English and are super polite (though they do seem to get overwhelmed when things get busy, which happens sometimes as this is a very popular hotel). There is a shuttle bus direct to/from Narita Airport. The hotel is connected via indoor passageways to Ebisu Station and the large shopping mall/dining areas within it.",4,2015/03/03
2,REDACTED,en,3789,"Don't expect any helpful sevice from the concierge at this hotel!

I needed a transport to Narita airport for my 2 small dogs and couple of large suitcases. Basically the only answer I got was that they only had one option costing close to over 500$. They refused to help me with any other options and finally I had to turn and seek assistance from my old house front desk. In less than 2 minutes they booked a transport with KM Taxi which is one of the biggest companies in Tokyo for half the price of the one Westin told me.

Do stay here if you enjoy:
-Passive aggressive behaviour from the service staff.
-Non existent service from the concierge team.
-Dated rooms and pseudo antique vulgar furniture.
-A mayhem at breakfast. I had to wait at least 20 minutes everyday to be seated for breakfast.
-Painfully awkward conversations between local Japanese gold digger women and caucasian men at the executive lounge area.

I would not recommend this hotel for business or pleasure! There are far better alternatives in Tokyo!",1,2015/02/28

2,REDACTED,en,3791,"Always a reliable hotel in Tokyo. The rooms could probably do with an renovation but it is still very comfortable with large rooms for Tokyo, great beds, good work desks and excellent F&B outlets. My only gripe would be the breakfast in the Exec Lounge is not great and probably better in the restaurant.",4,2015/02/28
2,REDACTED,en,3792,This was my first time at the Westin Tokyo and I was struck by the grandeur and classiness of the hotel. The expansive lobby exudes indulgence and the staff are attentive. For us the location was perfect as the hotel is only a few stops away from Shibuya and Shinjuku. The moving escalator that arrived nearly to the hotel was one of a kind and extremely convenient with our luggages in tow. We were upgraded with our Platinum status to a suite on the executive floor and the suite blew us away. The amount of space provided by the suite is a rarity in Tokyo and the food/beverage selection on the executive lounge was exquisite. We enjoyed many a nights sipping a complimentary cocktail watching the Tokyo skyline. Can't wait to go back. Thanks Westin Tokyo!,5,2015/02/24
2,REDACTED,en,3793,"Many heart healthy choices of Western and Japanese cuisine available.

Eggs cooked to perfection with a plethora of options.

Every detail a consideration not only to freshness, but seasonality and 
presentation.

The staff makes a concerted effort to embrace each guest as someone special. Kind, deliberate, efficient.


Daniel Jaeger Master Chef, and team leader creates a rewarding food experience each of the many times I have eaten his meals.

He is also a great conversationalist interjecting his wit and humor in between moving about the food stations and guests. He does an amazing job.

2,REDACTED,en,3794,"I stayed at the Westin Tokyo in January 2015 and had a great time. 

Check in: We were the only people checking in at the time, hence it was quite speedy. The staff at the check-in desk were very friendly and helped us get acquainted with the hotel. 

Room: The room was standard Westin quality which is great. The bathroom was quite spacious with both a shower area and bath area. The bed was very comfortable and the housekeeping made sure to replenish the amenities daily. The heated toilet, which is the norm for Japan was such a great feature. 

Hotel: We had a buffet style breakfast every morning at the restaurant on the main lobby floor. It has such a great selection and the staff were very friendly and helpful with any food items that we were unfamiliar with. I highly recommend the matcha smoothie that they offer on the weekends. It is delightful and I was provided with a recipe to make it back home. The hotel is located in a quieter stretch of area in Tokyo which I appreciated. It is very close to the subway line (a short walk), to take you to the busier area for sightseeing as well. 

Overall, I enjoyed my stay at the Westin Tokyo and I would suggest it for anyone who is looking to be in the heart of Tokyo without feeling like you. Very enjoyable stay.",4,2015/02/23
2,REDACTED,en,3795,"The Westin Tokyo is a gem of a hotel. The rooms are spacious and the staff are friendly and very helpful. The hotel is located in a great location in Tokyo - peaceful and quiet neighborhood which isn't too far from the city center. Ebisu subway station is less than a 5 minute walk away.

The breakfast buffet at the Terrace restaurant is excellent and provides a great variety of food to start your day right. While one can argue the décor is a slightly out of date, the hotel property has been meticulously maintained and nowhere does it feel old or worn.",5,2015/02/18
2,REDACTED,en,3796,"No surprises in my stay at the Westin.

Nice sized room with good amenities.
Had dinner in the lobby restaurant. Standard American fare.
Service was good. My keycard wasn't working, so was accompanied by a hotel guest services employee to make sure it was working the second time-I appreciated this as it would have been a pain to go back and forth several time to fix.
Location across the street from a mall/brewery is nice, but it is a haul on the airport limousine to get to narita, so i wouldn't recommend for a layover place to stay.",4,2015/02/17
2,REDACTED,en,3797,"Love Westin for its consistency. Several staffers offered to carry my bag when I arrived. Check in was warm and efficient. Public areas were clean and polished. Guest floors were spotless and quiet. Room was very clean and stocked with useful amenities and plush towels. Finally a stand-up shower that didn't leak all over the floor. Shower water pressure was incredible. Technology (TV, clock) was somewhat dated but worked effectively nonetheless. Gym is small and dated but never packed. Rooftop Lounge was cool - fab views. Breakfast was good each morning; quality coffee, international selection, efficient service. Great option near Ebisu.",4,2015/02/14
2,REDACTED,en,3798,"Had a two-night stay at the hotel mid-December 2014.

Booked a basic room and was upgraded to a corner room which was adequately furnished. The bed was typical Westin, very comfortable and I loved the bathroom which had heated toilet (normal in Japan), great shower and water pressure. Toiletries provided were L'Occitane, very nice! The room did feel a little warm though it wasn't a big problem.

Club lounge is at the top floor with good view and a decent selection of canapés and drinks.

Location was fair, would have been great if not for the 15-minute walk to the subway station.

I would definitely consider this hotel again for its competitive rate if the Park Hyatt is sold out.",4,2015/02/12

Once we visit the room where my son stays, I felt the decor was old. Need renovation or renew the furniture.",2,2015/02/11
2,REDACTED,en,3800,Loved our stay in The Westin Tokyo. We were there a week before Christmas and they had gorgeous Christmas decorations up which gave the hotel a very festive and warm atmosphere. The service was great and our room was huge by Tokyo standards. The breakfasts are great with a lots of choice. The service is superb. Best is the location which is adjacent to both the subway station (there's a skywalk for cold days) and to some great restaurants (Michelin-starred).,5,2015/02/08
2,REDACTED,en,3801,"Located a 2 minute walk from Ebisu Station, the Westin is located very well for traveling around and visiting parts of Tokyo.

The rooms are well appointed, but a bit old world (not contemporary); we prefer contemporary ourselves, but the rooms are still comfortable and reasonably plush and extremely quiet... I usually wear ear plugs in hotels but haven't had to here at all... oh, and the bed is super comfortable for a good nights sleep! :-)

The staff are supremely helpful, polite and follow-up on everything to make your experience here is a good one.

There are plenty of good restaurants less than a 5-minute walk... but we have preferred to hop on the subway - as it's so close - and try different areas of Tokyo, which has made our stay far more interesting...

We would not hesitate to come back and stay here - great staff, great hotel, great location... :-)",4,2015/02/07
2,REDACTED,en,3802,"Let me start by saying what I often say when I write a review. I am not your typical fruitcake with a sunny disposition who is easy to please so by taking the time to write this review and it being a glowing one means that this is a fine property. I stayed here for 18 days in January 2015.

It is not the rooms that make this a great place to stay. The rooms are actually a bit dated and could use some fresh carpets, curtains and furniture to get with the times. The views from the rooms are okay but not spectacular. 

The location of the hotel in Ebisu, however, is excellent. You never have to wait for a taxi as they are always lined up and waiting and the subway is a short walk from the hotel. The use of the Garden Place gym is an awesome feature as it is one of the best gyms offered by any hotel anywhere. I highly recommend using the belt massager on your lower back followed by the steam room after a long day of great shopping and chatting up a hundred cute Japanese chicks at Isetan or Ginza.

The executive lounge is quite good as well. There is a nice offering of drinks and tasty snacks all day and evening. My colleague practically lived in the lounge he liked it so much. The lobby and common areas while a bit dated still have a grand or somewhat regal feel to them which I appreciated. These areas are more impressive than the rooms.

Where this hotel really excels though is its staff. From the bell desk, front desk, concierge, door men to the restaurant staff, they are all first rate, well-trained, impeccably well-mannered and downright helpful. I won't bother with all the silly requests of mine they accommodated to no end but suffice it to say they always obliged with a smile.

But I must make special mention and save the best for last. As excellent as all the other staff here are, Chef Danial Jager is the shining star of this hotel. When I told the waiters my first day of my vegan gluten free diet they looked like they were going to pass out at first but it wasn't long before Chef Jager had all kinds of wonderfully special meals prepared each morning which suited my dietary needs and tasted great. Whether it was gluten free and egg free breads to some really exquisite vegan pancakes, Chef Jager's daily creations and hospitality truly helped make the Westin Tokyo a home away from home for me. His warm and light hearted nature was also delightful.

You may not have the same diet or whatever but the point is these people will bend over backwards to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable no matter what your requests or eccentricities. To me that it is a true five star level experience. If you want to be catered to, they are willing and able to do it. Kudos to Westin Tokyo from a hard to please guest.",5,2015/02/06
2,REDACTED,en,3803,"The service was impeccable and the property itself was equally so. The concierge was very helpful making dining arrangements before our arrival. The vies from the bar are amazing. I can't remember what floor it is on but has sweeping views of the city. I know it was Japan so very expensive. 2 Sapporos for 25 us. Great location. There is a ""mall"" and a market and several restaurants directly across the street. It is walking distance from the station. Free wifi in public areas.",5,2015/02/02
2,REDACTED,en,3804,"Compared to some newly open boutique or business oriented luxury hotels, this property can be categorized as an old fashion grand hotel. But I think the good management and maintenance keep it's edge. I booked a city view room that has a clear view to see Tokyo tower. The room was great and seemed to be in good condition in every aspect. The view from the window was truly spectacular especially at night! The best thing was the service of the staff. I was bounded in the Tsukiji shijo and about to miss the room check-out time at noon. I contacted the concierge and explained my situation through e-mail, the staff immediately replied and granted me 4 pm late check-out without hesitation and told me to have fun and relax. In short, I will suggest people travel to Tokyo stay in this hotel without hesitation.",5,2015/01/29
2,REDACTED,en,3805,"colonnades and furniture a bit oldy wih a strong italian greco roman ambiance.
rooms are quite big that is cool, beds are good, some units are difficult to use sucha as the slots for uploading your devices. very good location quite near of Shibuya. also in the neighbourhood, some nice shops and local restaurants.

the hotel also has old carpeting and the bathrrom is a little small with shower and tub .
i have also ask for appel juice in mini bar, they could not provide and were chargin me a glass of apple juice each day ! 
conclusion : not so thrilling place for Tokyo",3,2015/01/28
2,REDACTED,en,3806,"Thoroughly enjoyed staying at the Westin Meguro. Being only a 5 minute walk from both the JR line and the Tokyo metro was very handy. Loads of places to eat close by - both high end as well as cheap and cheerful.
It was nice to visit the hustle and bustle of busier parts of Tokyo ( day or night) but then retreat back here. 
The staff were very friendly, always smiling and checking to see if we needed assistance in any way.
The hotel was very helpful in arranging a birthday surprise at breakfast for my husband....we even ended up - by chance- having the general manager join in the celebration. We enjoyed the variety on offer for breakfast each day . Would happily stay here again next time.",5,2015/01/26
2,REDACTED,en,3807,"This place has the makings of perfect hotel. Close to my office, there's shopping nearby, amazing/inexpensive Italian restaurant across the street (also across the street Joel Bouchon's famous eatery). As a girl -- I was really impressed with the sit down lighted vanity (right out of Downton Abbey), and the magnifying mirror. And, they have in-room nail salon services!! But, here's the thing. My first room (#1226) smelled like a Bangalore cabbie. The ""plan b"" room (#1117) was not as pungent, but still smelly. Could be mildew (smells like BO) Eck. I was traveling with 2 colleagues. Their rooms were fine. Ask for the non-smelly rooms.",4,2015/01/26
2,REDACTED,en,3808,"Extremely disappointing to be told we would have to wait 1.5 hours until we could be seated for breakfast on a weekend as the breakfast buffet is popular with locals?! The staff were nice and apologetic but I would suggest the that the Westin looks after the guests staying in the hotel as a priority before those people walking in off the street. Needless to say that my wife and I with a hungry 2 year old went somewhere else for breakfast. That said the hotel is in a great location with shopping readily accessible. The room sizes are OK, however the hotel and its decor are very dated for a Westin hotel.",2,2015/01/23
2,REDACTED,en,3809,"This was our first time back in Tokyo after a long absence and our first time staying in the Ebisu area. We were pleasantly surprised at the rare greenery as we approached the hotel, which also had a very attractive garden area. This was a quiet property for Tokyo, unlike some of the busier more crowded and hectic areas around town, so was a very nice experience

I was initially a bit turned off when entering the lobby as it seemed rather ornate and a bit gaudy, but that was the extent of what I did not like about the hotel. Everything else here was first rate. Check in went smoothly and we were given a large, comfortable double bed room, with a roll away for our son and a great view of Tokyo with Mt. Fuji in the distance. There was plenty of space for all of us. The room was clean, well appointed, with every amenity we required, lots of towels, glasses, yukatas and toiletries.

Service here is wonderful, every employee we dealt with was polite, courteous and extremely helpful in making our stay memorable. We had sent our luggage by takkyubin from Kyoto and our bags were waiting for us in our room when we checked in. The airport limousine to Narita which picks up at the lobby entrance is also a great convenience. The Compass Rose Lounge on the 22nd floor is a nice place to enjoy a cocktail in the evening overlooking the Tokyo skyline and city lights.

The hotel is well situated for city transportation, the Hibiya subway line and Yamanote JR line at Ebisu station are a short walk from the hotel and we easily navigated Tokyo from here. In inclement weather you can walk the entire distance between the hotel and station via covered walkways and moving sidewalk. There are numerous shops in the station itself including an Atre department store. There is also a nearby Mitsukoshi department store branch which is very convenient. Although we loved stopping at Japanese coffee houses on our trip, we made good use of the nearby Starbucks in the morning where they have the best cinnamon rolls I have ever had at any Starbucks previously.

We loved our 5 night stay at the Westin Tokyo and would not hesitate to stay here again on future visits.",5,2015/01/21
2,REDACTED,en,3810,"After staying in many hotels in Tokyo, the Westin Tokyo is still my favorite so far and here is why. 

1. Location- It’s nice being out of the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. The Ebisu location is much more tranquil than walking out the door and having throngs of people everywhere (think NYC Times Square). The Ebisu train station is about a 1o to 15 minute walk. The only downside if you want to go where the action is, it’s about a 10 to 15 minute walk. BTW, there are many very interesting restaurants near the Ebisu train station.
2. Rooms- The size of the rooms are very large compared to most Tokyo hotel rooms and even bigger than the average USA hotel room. The rooms have a European feel with lots of granite and woods. 
I had a city view on the 19th Executive Club floor and had a beautiful view of the Tokyo Tower. 
3. Service- Tokyo is known for the service and the Westin Tokyo is over-the- top. In the morning you will always hear a chorus of “Ohayou gozaimas,” meaning “Good Morning.” The concierge, especially Benika was outstanding. She spent a lot of time writing down detailed instructions for anything I wanted to do. I think she would have gone with me to make sure I was ok but she did have to work. One of the hostesses in the Club Lounge stood out was Wakaba. She always had a big smile and was very attentive. 
4. Price- The price for the location, rooms, and service is very reasonable. At this time, the dollar is strong to the Japanese yen (close to 120). The rate was around $200/ night. For a Five- Star hotel you can’t go wrong",5,2015/01/20
2,REDACTED,en,3811,"Stayed here 2 nights in Jan '15. Very nice hotel, typical Westin comfort and luxuries in a very pleasant neighbourhood only a short distance from Shinjuku, Shibuya and Harajuku (all worth a visit particularly if shopping is your thing). Only detractor from 5 stars was the fact you had to pay for wireless internet in your room - at Westin prices I would expect this to be included.",4,2015/01/14
2,REDACTED,en,3812,"Did really like The Westin Tokyo! Slept here 4 nights and what a relax.
Really comfortable, easy to get in and, most important, delicious restaurant inside...........
Subways is just 10 min away so it is perfectly located for wandering around Tokyo.",5,2015/01/13
2,REDACTED,en,3813,"We opted for the executive club room at the hotel with access to the executive club lounge. The room is very spacious with a large king bed, and a sitting area with sofa and arm chair and a large executive desk. 

The bathroom is very dated (think salmon pink 80s classic) but it's very spacious and has good amenities. The shower also has very good pressure. The whole room and bathroom is very clean and well presented. The room has a tea maker, a coffee maker and a well stocked minibar which makes it that much more comfortable.

The executive lounge was well presented with ample food and beverage options. The service was OK. To be honest I expected something a little more personal, despite the size of the hotel. The views are enjoyable from the lounge and all the tables are fitted with tub chairs so you can make yourself comfortable and take in the view of downtown whilst enjoying a drink.

The lobby is very impressive, and the commissionaires and concierge are very helpful and cheerful.

The hotel is opposite a medium sized mitsukoshi department store, and the Ebisu beer garden which has nice summer-time outdoor seating. Keep walking (through an air-conditioned skyway) and you'll reach Ebisu station which is on the Yamanote JR loop line - one stop to Shibuya, and a few more to Harajuku and also the grey metro line, only a few stops to Ginza.

The area is quite out of 'down town', or what foreigners perceive as down town Tokyo, however with the trains and subway is well connected. It's located on a very quite street so you feel you're returning home as opposed to just going upstairs after a long day.

One tip; if you're arriving from Osaka on Shinkansen, alight at Shinjuku station, not Tokyo Station. The difference in cab fare to the hotel is about 3000 yen.",4,2015/01/12
2,REDACTED,en,3814,"This Westin is amazing. The management deserves and A+. Being a Japanese hotel in Tokyo certainly helps, but this hotel (and I have stayed in hotels in about 96 cities) certainly rivals the Oriental Mandarin in Bangkok (which has been rated #1 hotel in the world in the past). 
The service is at the highest level of polite, which is sometimes a little slow. The lobby floors are polished BLACK granite, which would show even 1 grain of dust, I have yet to see it. Within a noisy city, the hotel is very quiet, always. It has views of Tokyo Tower (slightly bent by the big earthquake of a few years ago), and on clear days, Mt Fuji !",5,2015/01/10
2,REDACTED,en,3815,"Stayed here for 6 nights in January. Boy, does this hotel needs a serious upgrade in their customer service! I have stayed at everything from similar category hotels to backpacker dives during our trip, and this was the second from bottom in terms of customer service, despite the fact that I am a Platinum Ambassador level on SPG (not touting status, but if you can't even make your very best customers feel good, there is a problem). A cold, impersonal check-in set the tone, but it continued right through the stay as we kept running into staff with attitude all around the hotel (front desk, concierge, restaurant). The only hint of warmth I saw was from one person in the executive lounge. I really wonder how this can be a hotel in this service/price category in such a service-oriented country. The location is just okay - 15 minutes walk to Ebise station and then a short train ride to some of the fun places. The only plus point are the comfortable (and well-appointed) rooms. Overall, recommend skipping.",2,2015/01/10
2,REDACTED,en,3816,"An excellent choice if you are looking for a quiet neighborhood in the buzzing Tokyo. A nice 15min walk to Ebisu JR or Hibiya subway stations through covered walkways. Yebisu Garden Place is just a stone throw away and often filled with decorations and event in the center square. There was a Swarovski crystal tree for Christmas 2014 and sparkles like twinkle starts in the night. A few restaurants and shops for a relaxing stroll.

The Deluxe room is large comparing to others in Japan especially the sitting area with a make-up table/chair and the bathroom with separate shower and tub. Decoration is classical filled with deep rich color and accent but nicely maintained. It will be nice to update the coffee maker/water boiler to newer quieter style and certainly appreciate a fully automatic toilet.

Staff is very polite and helpful throughout the facility. All stored luggage and mails delivered to room prior to check in which is a big plus. Phone requests are acceptable but could be faster in some cases. 

Highly recommended for a beautiful and comfortable experience.",5,2015/01/09
2,REDACTED,en,3817,"We were not impressed with The Westin. There is nothing special about it and the location is terrible. 

The room decor is outdated and needs a little renovation and the hotel charges you for internet. The location is not ideal. You have to walk far to get to the subway to get into the heart of Tokyo. Restaruants around the hotel that we saw were Italian Pizza plaes which is pretty terrible since you are in Japan. 

Not impressed and would never stay here again.",3,2015/01/07
2,REDACTED,en,3818,"The Westin is a pleasant hotel, with decent rooms, and good facilities. Good English spoken, good service too (but thats normal in Japan). Price is reasonabel too. Top floor bar has great views over Tokyo. Breakfast room on ground floor is bustling and good food. Their is a business floor that is acceptable and quite quiet.
Odd still that Hotels and bars (and much of Japan) allow smoking in public places, but thats a personal view. 
This is the only hotel i have stayed in tokyo so cannot compare, but its a good international standard hotel.",4,2015/01/06
2,REDACTED,en,3819,"I spent four nights at the Westin Tokyo last month and they simply got everything right: location, accommodations, perfect service, very helpful concierge, shipping our bags to Kyoto, it was all as good as a hotel gets. I have made many trips to Asia and have experienced good to excellent hotels. Westin Tokyo is the finest experience I've had and I will stay there on my next trip to Tokyo.",5,2015/01/05
2,REDACTED,en,3820,"Excellent Hotel!!! Extremely clean and even though it might be older, its extremely well kept up and old world elegance through out!! DVD in room (will play US format). Mattress is VERY firm, which i am assuming its Japanese style, but had no problems sleeping on it! 
If you encounter problems with staff not understanding english, just speak with the concierge, they speak excellent english! If you encounter problems, they will go out of their way to make it right!!!
Mall areas connected to property via walkway, 5 mins walk to major subway station (which have an extensive FOOD mall), near that is a multi floor shopping and food complex, and near that is extensive neighborhood with tons of places to eat and some shops!
Tips, if you arrive late and want to eat, make sure you walk a bit more instead of eating at the Sapporo Beer Garden, its over priced and not very good!",4,2015/01/04
2,REDACTED,en,3821,"I've stayed here twice now, most recently for 5 nights over new years for 2015. 

The rooms are large, very well appointed, quiet and spotlessly clean. The building is high enough to afford some good views over the city. Ebisu is very central and handy for seeing the city and there are a good number of decent restaurants near by. 

Staff are very professional & on the ball. We had an issue with the plumbing in our bathroom on the 3rd night and they sent someone up to fix it within minutes. 

I'd happily stay here again next time I'm in Tokyo.",5,2015/01/04
2,REDACTED,en,3822,"I spent 5 days at Westin during New Year's Eve with my family. Overall rating I was happy about our recent stay. Tokyo Westin I would classified as a business hotel with good wifi to keep you connected with the rest of the world. The price was much higher during the peak season.

Unlike Ginza, Shibuya, Shinjuku. Ebisu was not a major tourist area, very quiet at night. Not much activities. Even though on New Year's Eve the lobby was extremely quiet without celebration.

I was impressed on New Year's Day 2015 the executive club lounge breakfast was serving traditional Japanese New Year cuisine Osechi Ryori with rice cake mochi, egg roll, herring roe, chestnut, black beans and many more....
Allow me to experience Japanese culture. 

My summary of the hotel

Location : 8 mins walk to Ebishu JR and Metro which conveniently get around in major sight seeing area.
Passing by beautiful Yebishu Garden, art museum.

Shopping : Yebisu Garden Plaza, Mitzukoshi, Arte Plaza, Timberland, Monte bell outdoor sports shop

Restaurants: Michelin starred Joel Robuchon , different varieties of restaurants on the top floor of Arte plaza.
For local Japanese food cross the road on street level JR Station. 

The room was spacious and clean. 

The finger food at the club lounge from 5-7:00pm limited choice compare with other Westin hotel. 

Airport shuttle outside the lobby easy transfer to airport costs ¥3100.

Needs to improve
- Hotel key get demagnetise so easily. Have to change keys everyday.
- Concierge did really well helped me to book restaurants. However have no knowledge with regards of how to rent a phone, the local mobile wifi rental system, Japan free wifi system for tourist.

2 applications I found very useful during this visits like to recommend to friends
1. Navitime for Japanese travel - very useful provide options and directions to go to different area in Tokyo by metro and by JR.
2. For first time Japan travellers ""Good Luck Trip Japan"". It was extremely confusing when you cannot read Japanese and unable to communicate. The website provides basic training of 1. How to buy tickets in the vending machine
2. A vedio clip demonstrated how to sign up Japan free wifi services ? In fact really useful once you get into metro, JR station, bus stop, 7-11 .... Your phone will automatically detected free wifi for FREE.

Happy New Year and Happy travel to Japan!!",4,2015/01/02
2,REDACTED,en,3823,"First of all, Westin Tokyo was a very good old hotel situated right across the street from the Yebisu Garden Place. When we first arrived, I found that the staff were not helpful at all. They provided the cold service and I had a hard time communicate with them in English. We had to take care of our luggages ourselves after long hectic flight. I expected better from the so-called 5 stars hotel. Free wifi available in the lobby. 

We stayed in early Dec so they had the big Christmas tree up with magnificent decorations. The overall atmosphere was festive and grand. The most impressive thing from the stay was its location that right across the street from the Yebisu Garden Place where they had the Baccarat Eternal Lights (one of the world's largest chandeliers) on display. It was a great joy to walk pass it everyday during our stay.

The room was large, we got one overlooking the Yebisu Garden Place and the Michelin stars Joel Robuchon restaurant. The room was dated but comfy and clean.

The nearest JR station is Ebisu, Yamanote Line (light green) which runs in a circle to most of the tourist attraction spots. It was quite a walk from the hotel (maybe 8 to 10 mins, I was always distracted by the grand chandelier so was unable to time my walk), we had to walk through the Yebisu Garden Place everyday in order to get to either JR or subway station. Walking further from JR station for another 5 mins, there was a subway station, Hibiya Line (gray). I found it was easier to travel through JR trains. There were many restaurants and shopping malls near by. However, the restaurants around the neighborhood were mostly Western cuisine. 

We bought a round-trip Airport Limousine Bus from the Narita airport (bus stop no. 13) for ¥6000 per person. It came with 3-day unlimited subway pass. For ¥5700, you would get the round-trip tkts for airport bus and 2-day unlimited subway pass. The bus dropped us off at the hotel. There were a few tickets kiosks at the airport. 

To stay connect, I rented a SIM card with local number from Softbank. They also provided an option of renting the handset. For Japan, you don't have to pay for incoming calls (which is different from the states). The other option was getting a pocket wifi, so you can stay connect all the times. Before you leave, you must return the SIM card at the airport drop box. For pocket wifi, you can either return it at the airport or return by post before you leave the country.

I found the location was inconvenient, I would stay elsewhere next time e.g. Shinjuku or Ginza. Overall the level of service was below my expectation and took forever to walk from the hotel to train station both JR and subway. Without the great display of the Baccarat chandelier, I would be very disappointed.",3,2014/12/31
2,REDACTED,en,3824,"This is the first Westin I've stayed at that didn't feel like a Westin. My room did have a view of Mount Fuji which was great but to be honest that was the best thing about it. It wasn't awful...rooms were adequate, staff were helpful but it felt a little old fashioned. Good location for getting about town - with a station five minutes walk away and a shopping mall across the road. Wouldn't stay there again though.",3,2014/12/30
2,REDACTED,en,3825,"This was my first trip to Japan and the hotel did not disappoint. It was clean, decorative and the friendly staff spoke good English. I was a little concerned with the language barrier, but had no issues there. The food in the buffet was good, but not great and the drinks in the bar were small and expensive. Everything in Tokyo is overpriced in my opinion and this hotel is no different. But it is a great experience and highly recommend it.",4,2014/12/28
2,REDACTED,en,3826,"Was in Tokyo for business, hotel was comfortable but is getting dated- compared to with other Westin hotels around the world. Service was good. Station is a 10 minute walk or so through Yebisu Garden.",4,2014/12/28
2,REDACTED,en,3827,"We stayed just before Christmas, and the lobby was beautifully decorated and enjoyed seeing all the weddings using the facilities. Great location, near public transport and shopping. Listened to Christmas carols nearby and also enjoyed many meals nearby.",5,2014/12/26
2,REDACTED,en,3828,"Stay here three consecutive times in half an year in a corner room when I visited Tokyo. Each time I had wonderful stay experiences.

Westin Tokyo, which is opened in 1995, has a glorious history. It was ever one of the ""New Gosanke (The New Best Three)"" hotels in Tokyo. Although the crown isn't on it anymore due to the aging of the hotel, the service and the hardware maintenance are still outstanding.

The corner room is slightly larger than regular room and the layout is just excellent. The king size comfy bed is in the opposite of the sofa, where the flat-screen TV and the reading desk is in the middle beside the window area, makes it very convenient to do anything just like your own room. The room is one of the most comfortable that I've experienced in Tokyo in terms of the comfortableness of the bed, the air condition and the quietness. 

The hotel is located in Ebisu Garden Place Complex, where is a twenty-year-old multi-functional area includes a department store, a hotel and several nice restaurants, stores and office buildings. Although it takes around 10-15 mins from Ebisu Station through Yebisu Skywalk by walk, you won't feel it far away because the elegant atmosphere around the whole Ebisu/Daikanyama area and the convenient shopping surround the hotel.

Regarding the airport transfer, although it has limousine bus directly from the hotel lobby to Narita or Hakone Airport in every 20 mins, I still recommend to take the railway to save either time and money. The Limousine is almost two times expensive but takes almost the same time to the airport as the railway.

In general, Westin Tokyo impressed me a lot and I would recommend to all tourists to give it a try, especially if you are a fan of Daikankama.",5,2014/12/22
2,REDACTED,en,3829,"I've had the opportunity to stay at the Westin several times, most recently in December 2014. The rooms are a good size for a hotel in Tokyo, the breakfast is excellent, and the bar is comfortable. I also like the fact that they have a relationship with a gym/spa in the underground plaza. This gym is very nice and you need to go to the front deck to get a pass for entry. 

Is this the Park Hyatt? No. But it is also about half the price and very consistent. The service is great and they'll clean your shoes for free. All said a great hotel. If given the option, take Club level as the breakfast is free and it will include the main full breakfast downstairs. Safe travels.",4,2014/12/21
2,REDACTED,en,3830,"During our visit to Japan, we stayed in a few spg hotels. The Westin Tokyo was our favorite for location and amenities. It could be different from the other floors, but we were fortunate to stay on an executive club floor. Service at the hotel was also amazing. But everywhere we went, most people were polite, friendly and hospitable locals - despite the fact that we didn't speak the language. We felt so pampered in this country!

The dining area served up a light buffet-style breakfast (mostly American with a few asian options). There is also a restaurant in the lobby which executive floor guests can opt to dine at. If you're craving desserts, there is an amazing dessert restaurant. You can also get desserts to go. The staff will package these securely if you're traveling by train to your destination. There is also a fitness facility adjacent to the hotel (from the lower floor), that guests can use, but we got our workouts from hopping trains and seeing so many sights in Tokyo and nearby cities. The hotel is situated across from the Yebisu Garden (former beer brewery) and about .4 miles from the train/subway station - so you can catch JR trains (Yamanote line) to the major JR stations (to catch the Shinkansen/bullet trains), or local train lines. Allow time to walk. There are 'moving walkways' to assist in your journey which is also good if you're in a hurry (stand to the left/pass to the right). The station is accessible from a protected walkway (lower hotel floor), so you don't need to worry about rainy days (which are quite common). Also, there are many restaurants in this area, so you don't need to worry about where you'll get your next meal. The Mitsukoshi Department store is also here, so if you're looking for a snack and an amazing grocery/food fair experience, head to the basement of this big department store. You can get food to go, gifts and more!",5,2014/12/21
2,REDACTED,en,3831,"Being an SPG Platinum member, I'm rather particular when it comes to hotels. The Westin Tokyo was a great 5-star hotel is Ebisu, close to the subway and near some very good restaurants. The lobby and general hotel is very nice, but the rooms could use an improvement. We stayed here twice, once on the front end of our trip and once on the back end. While the rooms we had were both on the 18th floor and were similar, there were some minor differences that we definitely noticed, after our first stay. The rooms in general were a bit outdated, but still had that Japanese ""high-tech"" feel, with automated blinds, lights, bathrooms, etc. The second room didn't have some of the same conveniences as the automated blinds and lights, which was a little annoying. The staff, while hospitable, was a bit scattered. The concierge and front desk were a bit slow and speaking English in Japan can always be cumbersome (and rightfully so, as English is not Japan's official language). Overall, the restaurants, bars, and hotel in general was as expected for a Westin and I would definitely stay there again (after all, we returned at the end of our trip and despite the minor downgrade in room, were still satisfied). Understandably, it was a work week and we were not upgraded, which was disappointing. But being a Platinum member with an ambassador (i.e., I've stayed in SPG hotels for over 100 nights this year alone), I didn't feel completely ""pampered"" as I've come to expect at SPG hotels. Still, great hotel and highly recommended.",4,2014/12/19
2,REDACTED,en,3832,"a standard 5star hotel, nothing special.
decoration is quite out dated style. room is spacious, facility is good, it's very clean, staff is friendly, but nothing WoW you, nothing exceeds expectation.
rate is very high. that's another reanson that I won't recommend for non-business travelers.",3,2014/12/18
2,REDACTED,en,3833,"What a great hotel. So many good things to say about this place. 

Lobby: Upon entry, you feel like you're in a very refined, dignified establishment. It feels very mature, which was different from our experience at the Westin in Beijing and Shanghai. Both were nice hotels, but they seemed to be going more for a hip vibe. Check-in was smooth and quick and the concierge was very helpful in terms of planning our stay in Tokyo. We went to a lounge in the lobby, which enforces a dress code (no shorts, etc.). Great service and drinks.

Rooms: Our room was quite large and our friend's room was also a nice size. Everything was tidy and clean. Our room had a large desk with a fax machine, which I found hilarious. I had been told that it's still very common to use a fax machine in Japan, and sure enough we had one in our room. Our bathroom was also very large and the standing shower was terrific. 

Wifi: You have to pay for wifi, which again is very annoying. I hate paying to stay in a premier hotel and then have to be nickel and dimed for something as necessary as wifi. 

Location: The hotel is in Ebisu in Meguro. You have to walk a bit to get to the subway, but it's a pleasant walk and we always felt safe regardless of the time. I was surprised I wasn't bothered more by the walk to the subway since that's usually something I find annoying. We didn't do any touristy things in our area, but getting around Tokyo by subway is so easy. You can go everywhere on the subway. 

Service: Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. The staff is clearly well-trained. I had no issues at all. The concierge team is knowledgeable and was ready and able to answer our questions and the front desk attendants were incredibly helpful and efficient. I had some laundry done, which wasn't cheap, but they were quick. 

Altogether, we loved staying here and we would highly recommend the Westin Tokyo.",5,2014/12/10
2,REDACTED,en,3834,"This was my first time in Tokyo and I was happy to stay at the Westin Tokyo as it a little closer to the central part of town than the Sheraton. If you are arriving from Narita, plan on 1.5 hours to get to the hotel using the Airport Buses. They drop you off right in front of the hotel, which is nice. I didn't do my research when I booked this hotel as I booked it only because it was an SPG property - I used a Suite Night to be upgraded to a suite and was not that impressed. IT was two rooms put together. The decor might suit some but the marble pillars was a bit over the top for me. The room was huge but the furniture could be updated. The hallway carpet could be updated. The entire hotel could be updated. I can vaguely recall the movie Lost in Translation but I felt like I was in the sequel. I felt slightly off in this hotel. For starters, no channel was in English. There was CNN and BBC but it was voiced over in Japanese. There were appliances in the room's wet bar that were completely in Japanese. One of them had hot water and one of them was a expresso type machine but again, it was all in Japanese. I felt disconnected and like I should speak Japanese. 

The breakfast was very nice and varied. I did not like how the young lady at the front told me that the restaurant was closing in 25 minutes. I came at 10:05 and it closed at 10:30. I do not need to be told when breakfast was closing and 25 minutes was more than enough time for me to eat. 

The Club Lounge was nice with great views - varied food and alcohol. It seemed like guests made this a great meeting spot. 

The location is great - I would recommend staying here as a great base. Even though I felt greatly the language barrier, I followed the concierge's directions easily to the Ebisu station and from there, went all over. IT is not a far walk to Ebisu as you walk perhaps 5 minutes through this park and admire the trees and lights and then the moving floor can walk for you the rest of the way! 

Perhaps if I had spent more time there, it would have grown on me but I couldn't help but feel disconnected during my time there. I finally found a tv show in English and it was America's Next Top Model ... no comment.",4,2014/12/10
2,REDACTED,en,3835,"If you're looking at this hotel, then you won't mind paying for perks and the niceties in life. So I won't go on about the lack of free Wi-Fi in the lobby...I mean, how can you set up a dazzling Christmas tree with a motorized railset circling it in the lobby yet not provide guests with free Wi-Fi in the lobby. That said, the rooms themselves are as you would expect, with the bathroom being the centerpiece. Shower + large bath decorated in black marble and faux gold designed in Baroque style with plenty of towels make it a sin not to pamper yourself in the bath. Antique mahogany furniture gives you a real sense of old-money (and yes, the lobby was full of those clientele). Location was good, with access to the JR and the neighborhood was super quiet. All in all, it lives up to its reputation and you won't be disappointed.",5,2014/12/10
2,REDACTED,en,3836,"This hotel is still one of the best in terms of room size, elegant bathrooms and showers as well as fine restaurants and amenities. With the highest level of Japanese service yet comforting western touches this is an excellent choice for your stay. 
It is in Ebisu near the site of the former Sapporo brewery which has been redeveloped into a retail and office area. There are nearby restaurants and park like area across from the hotel to relax. A drawback already mentioned is location but an easy walk with moving sidewalks for a portion of the distance to Ebisu station puts you either on the core Hibiya Line to Roppongi or the Ginza or JR rail to all destinations. Also the station is a honeycomb of restaurants, fast food and retail.
I stayed here when we were relocating from Japan and always return due to the location (I like being a bit outside the hustle of Ginza/downtown), proximity to the Hibiya line and comfortable rooms.
It is VERY quiet so sleep quality is superb. Multiple restaurants provide solid choice should you not wish to go out of the hotel.",5,2014/12/09
2,REDACTED,en,3837,"We stayed at the Westin in Dec 2014. Good and efficient staff. Typical Japanese hospitality. However, the walk to Ebisu is easily 10 minutes or more. Rooms are 20 years old but still well maintained. (we were there when they are celebrating their 20th anniversary).

Unless you want to eat in the Hotel, not much choices after 10pm. A few good restaurants within the Westin Hotel and at the adjourning Yebisu Garden Place Tower, you can also find a few good restaurants on Levels 38 and 39. 

Would have been perfect if the walk to the station was more manageable.",4,2014/12/09
2,REDACTED,en,3838,"Located right in Ebisu, this hotel boutique is a must in luxury. I was impress how the staff was comfortable English speaking. Customer service is impeccable and the food is awesome. I love this hotel and just made it my #1 Hotel in Tokyo. Thank you Westin Tokyo!!!",5,2014/12/08
2,REDACTED,en,3839,"I stayed at the Westin Tokyo-Ebisu for the second time. The last time I was there was 17 years ago and not much has changed. The rooms are a bit dated on the decor side. They could use a bit of a modern update, but service is still great! I felt right at home and very comfortable. They have a number of restaurants and bars and they are all good! Very expensive if you are not on a business account and are a leisure traveler. I would recommend this hotel is is lovely and in a great location! You can get anywhere you need to be usually in less than 20 minutes! Train is close by, there is a nice mall and restaurants across the street and the train is a 12 minute walk. 
Overall, would recommend. Good location, clean and spacious and excellent service.",4,2014/12/07
2,REDACTED,en,3840,"Easy location that is just a 10 minute walk from my Japan offices and a 2 minute walk to the Japan offices of our advertising agency. Closeness to Ebisu station enables easy access to the Tokyo Metro system and it's just 2 stops to Harajuku shopping district. Lots of great food within walking distance of the hotel.

I have stayed at this hotel somewhere in the area of 20 times now over the past 6 years and the staff is attentive and recognizes the fact that I've been there so often. The breakfast buffet is solid but like all hotel breakfasts, over priced if it's not included in your room rate. There's a Starbucks just across the road that let's me fuel up for less that $10USD to start the day. The meeting facilities are also well managed and the meeting rooms are good for small and large meetings.

The fitness center is ok. I wish that they would add some kettle bells and a real squat rack but it's still better than most hotel gyms that I have access to when I travel. The treadmills and eliptical trainers are in good shape and they do have a complete set of dumbells for strength training. A few more meters of space would make a huge improvement. The bell captain can also give you access to a loaner bike and provide a running map for a 5k route outside which is great when the weather is good.

Rooms are always clean and well appointed. Air con system works well. My one suggestion to them is to actually but some more towel racks/hooks into the bathroom so that those of us who don't have to have fresh towels everyday have somewhere to hang the towels. I always ask for a room facing Mount Fuji as the view can be quite spectacular.

I'll be back there sometime early in the new year.",4,2014/12/07
2,REDACTED,en,3841,"The Westin is located in a calm spacious Ebisu area. The JR Line connects to the other part of city easily and the covered walkway made the commute easy. 

The Gym here is tiny but sufficient. What I like about it, is that one can borrow gym gear and have no excuse for not working out.

The breakfast buffet on Ground level is not to be missed.",4,2014/12/05
2,REDACTED,en,3842,"This hotel is a very nice hotel in a great location. Short walk to the trains and everything 
Tokyo. You have great shops and dining just across the street. It is a 20 minute train ride to most things. A little far from the airport (but you can take the airport bus with ease) better than the train as you get to see much of the city. Very westernized hotel but great to have a a place to relax. Highly recommend it for location and comfort.",5,2014/12/04
2,REDACTED,en,3843,"I've stayed at the Westin Tokyo (located in Meguro) several times now. It's about a 10 minute walk from the Ebisu subway station but half the distance is covered by a moving sidewalk/escalator, and the entire route can be traversed via a covered walkways (good when it rains). 

The hotel is quite clean, service good, and the rooms are for the most part spacious by Tokyo standards. The decor is rather dark and dated but oddly enough all the furniture appears to be relatively new. Try to get a corner room as they are slightly larger. Also, try to book a room on the executive floor as that will gain you access to the executive lounge that offers complimentary breakfast, happy hour (beer, wine, & spirits) and hors d'oeuvres in the evening, and access to a full healthclub nearby at the Yebisu Garden Place.

Please keep in mind that this hotel does a lot of weddings (they even have their own horse drawn carriage), and the hotel can be quite crowded on the weekends with wedding guests. I'm a Starwood Preferred Guest (Gold) so I'm pretty inclined to stay at SPG properties as I get lots of free upgrades. Would I stay at the Westin Tokyo if I weren't SPG Gold? Perhaps if I was on a business trip (and the company was paying) or I absolutely needed an English speaking staff. The hotel itself can be quite pricey even with the weak Yen but overall a very nice hotel.",4,2014/12/02
2,REDACTED,en,3844,"Spend two nights and this comfortable and well situated hotel in Toyko. good access to airports with the hotel limousine bus service and close to Metro through walkway under hotel to travel to key sightseeing locations around Tokyo. The local area is well worth exploring for bars and restaurants too.

staff very friendly and helpful.",5,2014/12/02
2,REDACTED,en,3845,"I stayed at the Westin Tokyo recently on business for three nights. The hotel is beautiful and in a great location. Tokyo goes all out for Christmas (even though it was mid November) and the tree in the lobby was spectacular. There are several restaurants in the hotel which are expensive, but excellent and the breakfast in the morning is extensive and lovely. The bar in the lobby is dark and very smoky (it was strange to see indoor smoking at a hotel), but it has a nice variety of wines and cocktails. There is an area outside of the bar that is non-smoking. My room was spacious and comfortable, however the TV choices in English were a bit limited. The bathroom was very ""western"", and not quite as fancy as some of the other hotels I have stayed at in Asia. 

Across the street from the hotel is a mall and a subway station which will bring you in only one stop to Shibuya Crossing which you must see. It is a very famous intersection and the shopping is endless. Also, one stop further is the Meiji Temple which is another ""must see"". Tokyo is an amazing city and the hotel was a nice landing spot while I was in town for business.",5,2014/11/27
2,REDACTED,en,3846,"It's a very nice hotel with knowledgeable staff and clean rooms but it's a bit far from the subway station - about a 10-15 minute walk. It's a fine walk in the morning when you're fresh and haven't walked 15 km around the city but at the end of the night, that 10 minute walk feels like it's a mile long haha. The buffet breakfast/brunch is very good and I would definitely reccomend trying it once. Rooms are quite large and it has a nice tub to soak in at the end of a long but great day.",3,2014/11/25
2,REDACTED,en,3847,"Hubby and I stayed 4 nights in total at this location during our recent trip to Tokyo (we had two different checkins since we went out of Tokyo for a few days in the middle). Since hubby is a Platinum SPG member we got the best room available during checkin, which was a room with amazing Tokyo views. They even sent up chocolates for us after checkin, which I thought was a very nice gesture. My advice would be to request a room with a ""Japanese style"" toilet, as these have amazing heated seats :) I did notice that the mattress seems a bit firmer than other SPG properties I have stayed at. Another feature that I loved was the fact that they had two sets of ""yukatas"" (casual kimonos) in addition to pajamas for guests. It was really fun to try on the yukatas and lounge around.

The Executive Club lounge at the hotel is also extremely nice. There is a wide variety of food for breakfast (the croissants were my favorite), and nice happy hour snacks/drinks.

We didn't spend a ton of time in the hotel as there was just so much to do in Tokyo, but whatever time we did spend at the hotel was enjoyable. 

The hotel is about a 7 minute walking distance from the closest subway (Ebisu), which is a bit far if you have a lot of luggage (thankfully we always travel with just carryons). However, the hotel provides very good directions on the website to navigate your way there. What I liked most was that the Ebisu light was a JR stop which meant we could conveniently use our JR passes from there.",5,2014/11/20
2,REDACTED,en,3848,My Wife and I spent 4 nights at the Westin. What a classy place. The hotel had everything you wanted from multiple restaurants and bars to the simpler buffet style meal. The room service for both late at night and breakfast (they send up a toaster so you can make your own toast and keep it warm) was wonderful. All of the staff from the front desk to the maids to the waiters were polite and knowledgeable. The concierge desk bent over backward to help us with directions and suggestions. We particularly enjoyed the big Christmas tree (and the small tree) in the lobby. Made us feel right at home,5,2014/11/14
2,REDACTED,en,3849,"The best Westin I have stayed ever. A true five-star experience with impeccable service and some of the most comfortable rooms I have been to. Location can be probably closer to the station, but if you are relying on a cab, it is irrelevant.",5,2014/11/12
2,REDACTED,en,3850,"The hotel is located next to a commercial plaza. Good location, only a few minutes walk from the train station. It is not too far to walk to business district either. The room is nice and clean. The service is fantastic. It also has a small but very nice garden behind the lobby. Enjoyed walking there. Would stay here again when I visit Tokyo next time.",4,2014/11/12
2,REDACTED,en,3851,"I had stayed in this hotel twice. Overall the experiences were excellent. If you had stayed in any other Starwood hotels in the past, this hotel was pretty much the same as any other in the US or in Europe. The room was rather spacious by Japanese standards as I have had stayed in other hotels in Japan many times before. This room was a palace compare to the others. I never had to play “zones” when there was more than one person in the room. The view was to die for as it was facing dead center to the Tokyo Tower. Like any other Starwood hotels that I have stayed before, the room was clean, the maid services were excellent and checking in was a breeze. There’s nothing I can complain about with this hotel.

However, with regard to the location of the hotel, it’s not an ideal location for people that like to explore Tokyo by walking. While this hotel is located near the Ebisu station on the JR line, it’s not close to anything in my opinion. You have to take the metro every time to grab something to eat or have a drink. It’s true there were a few restaurants around the hotels but choices were very limited. Perhaps I am little biased because I have stayed in many different hotels in Tokyo and I’ve got the opportunities to compare. I prefer a hotel where I can walk to a supermarket, restaurants or a bar whenever I want to even late in the evening. With this hotel, once you are in, you are pretty much through for the night.",4,2014/11/11
2,REDACTED,en,3852,"Very good service, beautiful washroom with complete amenity kit (brush and anything you might dream of). Complete neighborhood with restaurants and supermarket around. Mitsukoshi department store nearby, Ebisu station is walking distance. Perfect for business man or congress people.

The staff there is pretty amazing but, their english isn't really amazing you need to put in some effort but, they'll probably understand in the end. Amazing view though, I really have to give it to them. The terrace too had an amazing view but, there is too much smoking. Sweet staff though.

2,REDACTED,en,3854,"The Westin offered good service, great rooms on the Executive level which are very spacious with all that you require. Buffet great selection however expensive. The Executive Lounge was disappointing with limited selection of catering options throughout the day, this is compared with other 5 star Executive Level offers.

A lot of dining places nearby the hotel and the station. Some very well know Ramen places are within 5 mins walk from the station.

All are well with this hotel - the service, cleanliness, facilities, but one. You do not feel that you are in Japan. This hotel has a more european feel than Japanese.",4,2014/11/02
2,REDACTED,en,3857,"my partner had a. Very nice corner room with a great view, however the quality of the food in the Buffet section and the westin executive Club was quite disappointing. The food lacked creativity and taste and I found the every morning salmon and vegetables to be quite boring. there were no,unusual and creative pastries and it seemed like when you walked around the yebesa plaza across the street the bakeries and Delis are far. superior to,the quality than of this hotel. why is this so? I,was shocked by the cheap liquor
Brands like Smirnoff Vodka and Beefeater Gin. really??? You can't get much cheaper than Smirnoff. I think this hotel is cutting corners on their budget other than the beautiful Christmas decorations that adorn this hotel. a few of the front desk were curt and rude because they seemed ""busy, I think the culinary areas need a major overhaul! the ambience on the 17th floor 
Is,too bright with light with no music in the background. I felt as though we were I. The lounge of a ""cheap"" cruise ship. the staff were very stoic, rushed and not friendly. overall, quite disappointed for am Asian hotel...

2,REDACTED,en,3858,"I've been to Tokyo a few times, and wanted to stay away from the usually places like Shinjuku or Shibuya and decided to try Westin. Stayed for 3 days, as a SPG plat member, I was upgraded to a club room. I think room size are about the same as the normal ones but the lounge access is included. Nothing fantastic about the decor of the room and lounge seems to be just normal. In fact the lounge is below my expectation as compared with other Westins.

I tried the buffet breakfast it was great, a very good spread but a long queue if you are there during morning peak hours and waiting for the omelet. 

Location is fantastic if you are looking for somewhere pretty quiet at night but still only 1 station away from the action. Westin is basically just 1 station away from Shibuya and even a taxi ride is not that expensive. 
Opposite the hotel you can find the Yebisu Garden Place which is convenient for a supermarket, some restaurants, pharmacy and a Family Mart. There's even a DVD/CD rental store right next to the Westin. Yebisu used to be a brewery, hence you can find an assortment of beer served in the premise. Including a museum which is pretty interesting.

Only complaint I have for my stay is that if you are going to the airport at 6:30am (only the 2nd morning pickup), there's nothing the hotel can provide for breakfast. I have been to another Tokyo hotel which provided some sort of breakfast takeaway.",4,2014/10/31
2,REDACTED,en,3859,"Stayed at the Westin for three nights on business. As a platinum member, I was upgraded to a club room which was spacious and well appointed. The decor of the hotel is older and traditional not my preference but comfortable and kept up very well. The customer service was great and the buffet breakfast was solid. My lone complaint was that the food in the club lounge was ok and the liquor and wine selections weren't premium.",4,2014/10/28
2,REDACTED,en,3860,"My wife and I recently stayed for 3 nights after a 3 night stay in NYC. The hotel is 4 Star, all staff was very helpful. The morning breakfast was nice, evening lounge happy hour was standard. The city view from our room was as nice as the view from Tokyo tower. Location to train and eating was also convenient.",5,2014/10/28
2,REDACTED,en,3861,"Service express frequently either took forever to answer or just didn't answer. I actually videoed the time it took on hold- incredible!! My phone was inexplicably switched to ""no incoming calls"" and I could not get it taken off and thus I missed an important meeting. My message light was on practically the whole time I was there with no reason. I was misinformed by staff about: the duration of breakfast, the direction to the pool, the need for a voucher for the pool and my check-out date. 

The building was fine, rooms good enough for Westin. Lounge was OK. Bar on roof had nice views and good cocktails.",2,2014/10/24
2,REDACTED,en,3862,After a 12 hour flight the hotel was a great respite and was there for two nights for business meetings. The location was a bit out of the way but there was easy walking to get a Starbucks and do some shopping in this relatively new area. Across the street there are restaurants in the 37th floor for sushi with a view. So if you want to ease into Tokyo for a night or have business meetings that demand conference space and large rooms to work from this is perfect. Lots of locals with weddings at this location too. The workout area is small and could use a refresh. Service was excellent and very helpful.,4,2014/10/24
2,REDACTED,en,3863,"My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights in October for business. The room we were given was very spacious and clean with a really comfortable king size bed. The service staff were exceptional from the moment we got there to the day we left, helping us every time so gracefully including helping to rearrange our travel plans with another Westin in Kyoto due to the approaching typhoon.

On one of the mornings the breakfast staff were clearly understaffed, and the vegetarian selection was a bit sparse. So I let them know by email and the response I received was possibly the most humbling of experiences I have ever had. Not only did I receive a very prompt and courteous email apologising but the next day I was treated like royalty. They couldn't do enough to help me and they were so very nice, personally taking the time to come and speak to me, that I actually felt a guilty for mentioning anything!

I rarely give anywhere an 'excellent' but the staff, the rooms and the food were of the highest standard. A really great hotel to base yourself in Japan",5,2014/10/22
2,REDACTED,en,3864,"We stayed three nights at the Westin before our Princess cruise. Luckily I was upgraded to a one bedroom suite and my brother and dad got upgraded to an executive suite, he's a higher rated Platinum member than me.

Both suites were very nice and spacious, but the executive suite was huge. Breakfast was very good but pricey, if it wasn't included for us we would have gone outside of the hotel to eat. The service was excellent, everyone was so attentive and willing to help if we wanted it or not. 

The location is good, a bit of a walk from Ebisu station, but convenient with the underground path and some moving sidewalks. I do wish it was a little closer to the station since my dad can't walk too much, but it was a closer walk than the Sheraton Miyako to Meguro station.

We had to stay one more night since our cruise was delayed a day because of Typhoon Vongfong, so we moved to the Sheraton Yokohama which is much closer to the port. The train station is just across the street from the Sheraton. 

Overall the Westin was a great experience, we will definitely stay there next time we're in Tokyo.",5,2014/10/15
2,REDACTED,en,3865,Stayed here for 5 nights on business. The king non-smoking room was spacious. Bathroom was large and shower pressure was great. Breakfast buffet was expansive and had Western and Japanese choices. Most mornings I had Starbucks for breakfast which is right across the street from the hotel. Food choices for dinner are pricey at the hotel so ask the concierge or trip advisor for offsite dining. There is a mall across from the hotel on the walk to the train station which has food options such as a gourmet grocery store and bakery. The walk to Ebisu train station is not as far as others say it is. I would stay at this hotel the next time I am in Tokyo. Airport Express bus to/from Narita stops here.,5,2014/10/12
2,REDACTED,en,3866,"A hectic days shopping and sightseeing in Tokyo perfectly calmed by friendly staff, great ambiance, large rooms and great bathrooms at the Westin. Stayed on 19th floor which was quiet and with access to executive lounge on 17th floor. Tired feet and bodies rejuvenated after a great French meal across the road from Westin and then enjoyed drinks and a cigar at "" The Bar"" in the Westin. If you are looking for a little extra luxury at very affordable rates you now know where to go!",5,2014/10/10
2,REDACTED,en,3867,"Westin Tokyo retains the standard you would expect in other Westin hotels in Asia. While it lacks the Japanese touch to their style and service, it is definitely very service oriented and makes you feel that you at home. 

What I really like is the convenience of the location which is near the Ebisu station, quiet surroundings yet surrounded by a lot of great eating places.

2,REDACTED,en,3868,"After reading some of the less enthusiastic reviews when we booked this hotel we were pleasantly surprised at how accommodating and helpful the hotel staff truly were. They made our trip. Especially the front desk staff. And we were also happily surprised at what is available in the area around the hotel. 

Also amazing. The buffet breakfast. Try everything. 
Only a ten minute walk (with over half a dozen moving walkways) to Ebisu Station that is on the key JR Yamanote train line that circles tokyo. The area around the station is fabulous, as is the neighbourhood around the hotel. Worth a walk outside (not in the fancy walkway tunnel) to get your bearings, discover some great dinner options, shopping and find the local convenience stores. 

Specifically, we did a two-person karaoke by the station at Big Echo, a must date in Japan! We discovered Mos Burger (north end of station near overpass, chilli burger amazeballs), a local pub restaurant, three min from hotel, a ramen chain, amazing Soba: all pictured menus so super easy to order. I did a tonne of shopping in the mitsukoshi department store across from the hotel on my last day. Wish I had discovered it earlier. 

The room was super clean. We were on the 19th floor and had a superb view of the city. The Tokyo tour side is probably in demand unless it is winter because on the other side you can sometimes see Mt Fugi: both very cool! 

We ate at the Chinese Restaurant in house. The service was insanely attentive and the food good. A little expensive but we needed a night in. 

Also, we stayed here on our first night then left our luggage at the front desk for a two day back-pack train trip to nagano. The staff were excellent at keeping our bags as they were waiting for us in our new room upon our return. 

Most of all I will probably miss the Japanese Robot Bidet toilet. Lol. Excellent toiletries, toothbrush, etc. very clean and comfortable and sizeable room for Tokyo. 

We will be back. Arigato Gozaimasu Westin Ebisu/Tokyo! Mata ne!",5,2014/10/02
2,REDACTED,en,3869,"This was a fine hotel in every respect - absolutely no complaint and a large room by Tokyo standards. Bit of a walk to the metro/train, but not an issue. While suitable for my needs during this stay, I would aim for something at a better price between Shinagawa and Shimbashi/Ginza next time.",4,2014/10/02
2,REDACTED,en,3870,"Pictures don't really do it justice - from the moment you step into the foyer, with its high-ceilings and black marble, through to the rooms with their delightfully detailed and beautiful furniture, you know you're in a hotel of the very highest standard. My bed was almost too comfortable (getting up for work was difficult), the bathroom was lovely - and nicely lit considering it's in black; it was quiet, good climate control, attractive. I could find no fault with it whatsoever. Staff were efficient and helpful; it's a five minute walk to Ebisu station, and if you don't want to eat in the hotel there' a large complex across the street that has everything from a five-star Joel Robuchon to a beer hall; taxis are frequent; there's an airport shuttle bus....

Honestly, I have nothing but praise. It was a wonderful experience, and I'll certainly go back.",5,2014/10/02
2,REDACTED,en,3871,"This was the first visit to Japan for my wife and I, and we were happy with our stay here. Because the hotel was busy, they were not able to upgrade us. The regular room we received was okay, nothing special, but it was comfortable and clean. Breakfast at the 17th floor Executive Club was somewhat limited but the selection at the 1st floor Terrace is extensive, including pancakes, freshly squeezed juice, and other hot dishes. 

The hotel is not in the city center, but the location is still convenient. The Ebisu station is served by both the subway and the JR lines and is a 7 minute walk via a moving walkway. Taxis are also easily available at the hotel. On the other side of Ebisu station, there are a number of small, local restaurants that stay open late / all night. 

We received excellent service at the hotel. On the day of our check-out, my wife was waiting with our luggage in the lobby while I was at the front desk settling the bill. A staff member proactively came up to her, helped her with the luggage, got her in a cab, and explained to the driver where we were going, while I was still checking out. By the time I was done, we were all ready to go. Efficient, courteous, and helpful, and we very much appreciated it!",4,2014/10/01

2,REDACTED,en,3873,"Just returned today from a 7 night stay at the Westin Tokyo. This hotel is absolutely beautiful. There is marble everywhere. Very, very, very nicely decorated and extremely upscale feeling, but not pretentious at all. We are plat SPG and were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary. We received a nice suite upgrade and also had access to their club lounge. I found that ALL hotel staff members were very accommodating and very helpful. I was surprised at how quiet this hotel was. I had never been to Tokyo before and granted other parts of the city are quite noisy (like Time Square on steroids), this part of Tokyo (near Ebisu JR train line) was extremely quiet. I would definitely stay there again. I really liked the fact that they offer guests a ""going green option"". We don't need our sheets nor towels changed daily so for each day that we opted out of a linen change we received a 500 spg point credit. This was a nice perk, but we would have opted out most days either way. Additionally, Ebisu train station is relatively close by and you can access most main sites in Tokyo from this line without having to access the subway at all. Lastly, there are some really great local restaurants just outside of the Ebisu train station…don't exit the Garden Palace exit (where the hotel is)…take the other exit from the train station. You will see a bank there then immediately across the street you will see a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant and a life size statue of Colonel Sanders. Go down the street right by the KFC. You will see some small restaurants that seat only 5-10 people, but the food is cheap and very good. If you go about halfway down that street on the left side you will find a nice local stand up bar also. Overall the entire area feels very safe and is lovely to walk around at night time. You will be very happy at the Westin. We did go to the Park Hyatt to have a drink and check out the view and the staff was super stuffy and the glasses of wine and champagne were half / 3/4 pours. My husband (a sommelier) and I thought they were joking or they were going to come back for a refill etc.. but they didn't. You won't find that sort of attitude at the Westin. They will roll out the red carpet for you but make you feel super comfortable and welcome even if you are wearing blue jeans. The bar is nice and the food is great too. Well worth a visit. One of the nicest Westin hotels that I've stayed in. Well above par compared to US Westin's. Enjoy….Wish I was there now :) … P.S. quick testament to classiness of hotel….we were only going to stay for 6 nights, but added on a 7th. We had the suite upgrade and then added points for regular room for the 7th night. We offered to move to a standard room for our last night (understanding that they probably needed the suite for another customer)..and we were ok with moving. The next am they called us and invited us to stay that last night in our current suite and that we didn't have to move etc. I thought this was a really classy gesture. We are very grateful for how much the staff there went out of their way to make our stay even more pleasurable. You will enjoy your stay too. Nice and quiet…beautiful…Also there is a Joel Rubicon restaurant right across the street too. We visit Atelier in Las Vegas so we didn't go the his restaurant whilst in Tokyo, but the location can't be beat if you like his food then that would be a great choice. We opted for more affordable, traditional Japanese food in the area that I mentioned earlier in this post or at other parts of Tokyo.",5,2014/09/29

Close to Ebisu station connecting you to everywhere else. Yebisu Garden Centre, across the road and on the way to Ebisu, has all the shopping and restaurant options including Burger King and Starbucks, if you must!
The hotel staff are friendly, super-efficient and speak English. The rooms are large, have great views, opening windows (rare in Japan), and smoking and non-smoking floors. All are well equipped. I would recommend the Exec Club option, this gives free wifi (normally 1500 yen/day), breakfast in a choice of 2 places, free tea, coffee, snacks throughout the day. Free alcohol with hot snacks from 5.30-7.30pm daily. The staff will help with everything and you can check-out from here too. You also get DVD/CD player in-room.

The staff was very helpful, superb lobby, and clean throughout the whole property. This is also a pick up location for the airport limousine bus to Narita and Haneda airports.

They called the bus company repeatedly that week and kept me informed of the status with messages on my room phone. I was shocked! That level of service and dedication really showed the true colors of Japanese hospitality.

Minus one star for the location. The metro is a solid 10-12 minute walk and a bit confusing to navigate the first time. Granted, the moving walkways help, but it's not convenient for transporting bags or suitcases. Thankfully taxis are always available!",4,2014/09/15

The breakfast was a standard spread you would expect of a Westin. However, in terms of the location, the hotel is really off. It takes you a good 15 minutes of brisk walking to get to the Tokyo Metro so if you want to use the subway and be in and out of the hotel during the day then be prepared to walk and extra half hour back and forth for each trip. Information on the website "" Popular shopping areas such as Ginza, Shibuya, Shinjuku, Akihabara, as well as Roppongi for evening entertainment, are accessible by foot, taxi, and train"" is completely misleading as each of these places is a good 40 minute walk!

Rooms are quite spacious for Tokyo's standard, though the shower is quite cramped. The price is lower than Hyatt, and hotel seems livelier. The surrounding Ebisu Garden, which is very European, though everything closes around 9PM. The station in 12-15 min walk, and JR station is 8-10 min walk. Great property, great staff.

Good light blocking curtains and once you're in the room you do not hear any noises outside.
We did not try any restaurants in the hotel. 
A shuttle bus to Narita and Hanida airport stops right outside the hotel and we only paid 900 yen to get to Hanida which took around 1.15h. 
We both really liked the area (we normally tend to stay in the intercontinental Tokyo bay) so it will be tricky to decide between the two next time.",5,2014/09/03
2,REDACTED,en,3886,"I stayed there for 7 days and enjoyed every moment of it. The Club Lounge had good food and beverages, and the housekeeping kept my room clean daily. The room was bigger than the local Japanese hotels, so I had plenty of spaces to put my many suitcases there.
I would stay there again.",4,2014/09/02
2,REDACTED,en,3887,"The SPG Tokyo Hotels are not the most modern but after staying at the Sheraton it was really a great time. The location is tucked away in a neighborhood next to a large outdoor pavilion. The club room has drinks and light snacks but the breakfast was a really nice buffet with something for everyone. Then a 10 minute walk and you are connected to many subway lines to explore the city. It is so easy to get around in Tokyo! Near Ebisu station there is a bustling neighborhood with tons of restaurants filled with very noisy locals drinking and eating, go down the main stairs and out.",4,2014/09/01
2,REDACTED,en,3888,"Westin has always been my favorite hotel brand. Having previously stayed in Westin Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Venice, Singapore, Osaka -- our recent stay at Westin Tokyo indeed sealed my utmost fascination to this SPG Hotel.

Sheer opulence -- that is the best description that I can say about this hotel. The hotel I believe is one of the oldest hotel in Tokyo, but I can claim that it’s being “vintage” further enhanced the hotel’s lavishness.

The room that we occupied was quite spacious, me and my husband plus our teenager (son) fitted in comfortably in their double room. The room was super clean and was generously provided of in-room amenities. I can never complain, specially that the room that was allocated for us had the view of Tokyo’s skyline and the famous Tokyo Tower!

Service and hospitality at this hotel was commendable. I communicated a number of times to the hotel prior to our arrival and my emails were answered promptly and all of our requests were graciously accommodated.

The location of the hotel was also an advantage, it is a few minutes’ walk to the train and subway stations. 

The covered walkway to the Ebisu Station is accessible from the hotel’s basement. Ebisu is on the main train line (Yamanote) and this provides accessibility to most of the tourist attractions in Tokyo.

There is a convenience store (7/11) nearby and a number of restaurants and cafes are also available within walking distance.

I love Tokyo, I love Westin and I wish to go back!",5,2014/08/25
2,REDACTED,en,3889,"Can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel. The location was perfect, right in the middle of the Higashiyama district, a short bike ride to the temples in either the northern part of the district or the south. A shuttle ran every 30 minutes to Gion, a 15-minute ride away. The view of the city from the rooftop was stunning. But best of all was the service, by far the best I've experienced anywhere. The concierge went out of her way to sort out a problem with one of the bikes we rented from an outside vendor, even going so far as to pay us back for the faulty bike before the vendor came to pick it up. We must have asked them to reserve a half dozen restaurants for us and they kept trying until we finally found a place that was open/not booked.

The rooms, though a little dated, were very spacious and clean, with a nice view of the gardens. I would return to this hotel in a second and I can't say that about many places.",5,2014/08/24
2,REDACTED,en,3890,"This was my first stay at a Westin property in Asia and I have to say that my experience in Tokyo was most satisfying. I've had the opportunity to stay at many of the Westin properties across Europe and would say that it is the equal of the top units there. It may not have the grandeur of some of the older and more historical properties there but when evaluating all areas to be reviewed, it really can be included among the best.

What really stood out was the effort among almost all the staff that I encountered throughout my stay. Efficient, helpful, friendly and concerned are words that come to mind when describing the service. I've been in the hospitality business for over 30 years as an owner of restaurants and a consultant, I can state that the level of service received as exemplary. Only in one instance would I state that the service was not up to the level of the others and that was at the formal bar. The bartender was extremely efficient but a bit too a aloof for my liking. However, that may be the approach the management wants at that venue so I can't really fault the ""style"" there.

The corner room was an upgrade on the higher executive floor with a great view of the city. I had booked another room for my business associate and although he is not a Platinum member they still upgraded him to a similar room and accorded him all the same benefits. Quite a magnanimous gesture especially considering the benefits one receives as a Platinum member especially in properties outside the States. Clean, tidy and many creature comforts such as a casual kimono to wear made it a place to relax after a long day. A small issue to mention was the very faint smell of cigarette smoke. Although the room was non smoking, I think that the ventilation system may have been the culprit as my associate who was on the same floor noticed the same slight odor. Again a minor issue that didn't detract from my opinion of my stay.

Food and beverage quality was of high quality and choice at the breakfast buffet. The food in the Executive lounge wasn't up to the same quality of the main restaurant but more than acceptable. Great choices of spirits at the formal bar was much appreciated especially among the single malt Scotches. Although many of previous reviews mention the high prices for food and beverages here, I really didn't find them to be that overly priced and remember as a reference again, I'm in the business.

Location is superb as Ebisu is a good location for many reasons. Yebisu Gardens and the surrounding facility is quite nice and spacious in a modern setting. The Ebisu train station is about a 10 minute walk but is an easy stroll through the Ebisu Garden facility and made easy by a motorized skywalk if you're a bit tired. Taxi rides to the major areas are not overly long. The longest one was to the Tsukiji fish market which was about 25 minutes.

All in all a very satisfying stay and when I return to Tokyo again, I won't see a need to look anywhere else to reside. The Westin Tokyo had made that a very easy decision.",5,2014/08/21
2,REDACTED,en,3891,"Everything about this property represents the essence of good hospitality. The staff are extremely courteous and make the effort to show that they care about all guests. The reception was seamless,and bell-staff efficient and very co-operative. The rooms at Tokyo Westin are well designed with excellent furnishing, generous amenities focused on simplicity and functionality. The location is very convenient, within a short walking distance of a major subway station, next to beautiful recreation center (Yebisu Garden Place) and a classy department store with lots of eateries.
We we enjoyed the stay very much and will definitely be returning to this lovely hotel in our next trip to Tokyo",5,2014/08/20
2,REDACTED,en,3892,"First visit to japan so didn't know what to expect. Had assumed that Westin being a global brand , would have standard service. This hotel went beyond my expectations and he only reason is the staff . The Japanese culture of being polite to everyone is taken to new heights in his hotel . Right from the moment I checked in till the moment I left was wonderful . The best moment would be when one day I came back from my morning run to be handed a towel and bottle of water at the entrance without me even asking for it .",5,2014/08/16
2,REDACTED,en,3893,"My stay was wonderful. My room was perfect, clean everything! Location depends what you want to see.. Everything is a train ride away. 10min walk to JR station/subway ect. I never write about anyone but 
I would like to thank the Chef at the Terrace ""Daniel Jäger"" for tending to a picky eater like myself! For the Great buffet and to all my request. To every bartender on the 22nd floor Best drinks ever! Thank you Westin & Mr. Chef Daniel Jäger for making my first stay in Tokyo simple as pie.",5,2014/08/16
2,REDACTED,en,3894,"Westin Tokyo was the final destination of our anniversary trip (4th-7th July 2014) in Tokyo. Overall we had a great stay and my family really enjoyed it. 

The hotel location isn't the easiest for tourists who use public tranportations, but great for people with a rental car like us. I liked the location because it was away from the busy areas, but still a lot of good shoppings and restaurants nearby. A lovely sunday market was just across the street from the front door. Extremely easy to get to the main shopping area where is less crowded than Shinjuku or Shibuya. Ebisu area is much more upper class and relaxing. 

Almost everyone in the hotel could speak good english, all of them were helpful. It might be the Japanese culture that they didn't really have big smiles on their faces but I could feel they were keen to meet our requests. There was a mistake made by one of the concierge staff which caused us quite a bit of trouble, but they tried hard enough to solve it. A sincere apology from the staff and the guest relationship manager were good enough and they did all their best to help me out throught out the rest of the stay. I would like to send a big thank you to the ladies at the concierge and the guest relationship manager who was kind enough to listen to my complaint. 

A bottle of sparkling wine was sent to us for our anniversary, it was a nice touch. Room was a bit in the 90s style but nice and clean with all the things we needed. I traveled with my two daughters and those kids pajamas were cute and comfy. 

Breakfasts were excellent, and on Sunday we had the japanese style breakfast in the Japanese restaurant and it was really good. Just that it was so busy on Sunday, we had to wait for 20 mins before we could get a seat. 

It was not a perfect stay, but good enough for us to go back to Westin Tokyo when we travel to Tokyo again.",5,2014/08/13
2,REDACTED,en,3895,"I expected big things from The Westin Tokyo; I stayed at The Westin Chosun, Seoul previously and was very happy. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the hotel. The lobby is wonderful, but the rooms are dated. Old bathroom; small, awkward shower; time-worn carpet, and out-dated coffee maker are few examples of how The Westin Tokyo fell short. The bed was comfortable, but I would not say “heavenly”. Room service for breakfast was fine. I would not recommend staying here as a tourist; the hotel is far away from most tourist attractions. Be aware, the bus to the airport has limited departure times. Overall the room did not meet Westin standards.",3,2014/08/12
2,REDACTED,en,3896,"This is my third stay at the Westin Tokyo and it never disappoints. I first chose this hotel for the location, it is a 10 minute walk from Ebisu station which can easily connect you to any of the main lines. Additionally, the hotel is near a mall (5-minute walk) - gets you near a pharmacy, mall for shopping, and food options. A little farther away about 15 minute walk gets you even more local food options at reasonable prices and great food. (The concierge can point you to the places).
They have a nice spread at breakfast and all kinds juices (including a rotating daily juice). If you are staying the weekend however, you might want to make a reservation as it gets crowded. They also have a nice lounge upstairs but breakfast selection is more limited. Nice respite with good view of Tokyo though in the afternoon (with snacks and drinks).
The rooms are relatively good sized and have modern amenities. They have done a good job keeping the place clean and updated. Wifi connection was good as well. 
The concierge service is excellent, I had them help make reservations at hard to get to restaurants and they did an amazing job getting me into almost everyone. All in all, you really can't go wrong with this Westin.",5,2014/08/11
2,REDACTED,en,3897,"This is my first visit to Tokyo and I am here for pleasure. I am a platinum Starwood member and stay about 75-80 nights per year in hotels. This hotel is even better than its reviews. The property has a refined, modern elegance. The rooms are modern with a Japanese flair. Every staff member has been polite and helpful. English is spoken by most staff members. As a platinum member I have access to breakfast either in the Terrace full amazing buffet or the exec floor where there is a great two hour cocktail with appetizers and drinks on the house. The location is right by the Ebisu JR line for easy access to everywhere. This is among the best Westin properties I have stayed in and recommend it highly!",5,2014/08/07
2,REDACTED,en,3898,"My wife and I visited Tokyo and stayed at the Westin because of their reputation and we were not disappointed. The hotel was very clean and elegant, the staff was courteous and helpful, and the food breakfast buffet was well appointed and delicious. 

It also needs to be mentioned that the hotel proximity to Yebisu Garden Place and the Ebisu Station. Off of the JR line, it is very easy to get around Tokyo's many attractions for very little money. Located in a quiet neighbor hood, the Westin Tokyo in my opinion is the perfect place to stay when visiting. T",5,2014/08/06
2,REDACTED,en,3899,"We had a great experience here. The breakfast was excellent. Most hotels in Japan (a large sample of Starwood, Hilton, IHG, etc., as well as local hotels) seem to mess up breakfast. They can't do things like bacon, eggs, french toast, etc., properly. The Westin managed superbly. The Westin Workout was great. This is another thing Japanese hotels often get wrong. First, it had enough cardio equipment. Second, it had enough weights and machines for a halfway decent workout. Third, it was actually open 24 hours. I've stayed at Japanese hotels where the gym didn't open until 9. The executive lounge was great. We took advantage of the appetizers and cocktails whenever possible. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were about twice the size of any I've been in within Japan. And the decor was amazing. I highly recommend the Westin.",5,2014/08/03
2,REDACTED,en,3900,"Although the hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the Ebisu metro, the location is good. There is a small mall with a variety of restaurants and shops (Yebisu Garden Place) between the hotel and the station. There are also nice restaurants and bars surrounding the station, and a great mall that is connected to the station. The rooms are nicely appointed, relatively large, and attractive. The club room is good/average. Breakfast is also good/average. 

The service at the hotel is phenomenal. The hotel was sold out for one of the nights in the middle of our trip to Japan. We decided we wanted to stay in Tokyo at the hotel, and the desk attendant in the club lounge not only was able to get us our room, but also allowed us to use points for the night. The concierge was able to help us get tickets to a baseball game, gave us maps to get to the best stops in the fish market, and recommended several stationery stores to me and marked them on a few maps. 

My only complaint was the bed. The mattress was very firm, and the pillows were very thin and soft. Perhaps this is according to Japanese taste.",5,2014/07/26
2,REDACTED,en,3901,"I’ve been here quite regularly as I like the service and proximity to various places that I need to visit like the office and other companies that I meet with. 

But on this visit, one of my colleagues showed me a walkway from level B1 in the hotel underground to the Ebisu JR and Hibiya subway line! When I think of all those occasions when I battled the elements walking across the snow-covered street and Ebisu Garden Place when I could have walked underneath in comfort, I made a resolution to explore any hotel that I visit!

The service in this hotel was excellent as always and was impressed with the service in the executive lounge and The Terrace restaurant on the ground floor, where Yukare Tange and Nakahashi were exceptionally efficient, friendly and helpful!

My room was smaller than on previous visits but nevertheless, looked out towards the Ebisu Garden Place and was very pleasant. I did notice there weren’t as many bathroom amenities in this room though and thought that cotton swabs would be standard fare?

There are many conference rooms on the lower floors and it seems to me that there’s always a wedding in this hotel? Perhaps the Westin Tokyo specialises in this? 

The JR Yamanote line is very convenient for getting around Tokyo and it’s about a 10-15 minute meander to the Ebisu station with the Hibiya subway station only a few minutes further.

The sound of the trains passing is noticeable from the room but not loud enough to be annoying.

Again, a great stay and recommended to all!",4,2014/07/26
2,REDACTED,en,3902,"Wife and I stayed for 8 nights of vacation and were delighted. We lived in Tokyo some years back, and are familiar with several of the city's nice hotels, but this was our first stay at this Starwood property. 

The room was bright, smartly appointed and very large. The bed was extremely comfortable and fresh. Every interaction with staff was a pleasure. They could not have been more friendly and helpful. The Executive Lounge was nicely arranged, and a convenient place to rest between outings. The location in Ebisu is ideal: just a few minutes walk from JR's Yamanote line and the Ebisu Metro station. Many shops in the area and they -- and the trains -- can be walked to from the hotel's ""B1"" level without once passing outside. 

This is one superb and very well run hotel. Wonderful experience. We'll be back!!",5,2014/07/26
2,REDACTED,en,3903,"We stayed here as it was well regarded, but we were deceived a bit. The rooms were good, with good views, and the breakfasts were also good, but the beds had a sheet and a duvet in very hot weather which was a pain. Also we wanted the one of the concierges to book two restaurants for us, and she managed to get it so wrong, she couldn't have got it more wrong. She got the restaurant on the wrong day, the wrong time and she didn't even book the other!! Also the hotel was quite far away from the centre. It was about a 15 mins walk to the tube station each day, which was a bit of a pain. And you had to pay for the wifi, it was about £7 per day, which was cheeky for a hotel of this price!!
So wouldn't stay here again...",2,2014/07/26
2,REDACTED,en,3904,"Good location--about a 10 min walk from the Ebisu JR station and about 15 from the metro. It is right across the street from a shopping area called Garden Terrace with restaurants as well. The rooms were a good size and everything was comfortable. The décor is a bit dated, but everything was clean. The bar was nice with good food. We stayed on the exec floor so got to have breakfast and drinks in the exec lounge which was a nice way to end the day. We had breakfast at the buffet a few days but the exec lounge has a continental breakfast which was also good. Definitely recommend it as it was a good location and friendly, helpful staff.",4,2014/07/26

2,REDACTED,en,3906,"Waking to our second last day at Tokyo. We are very pleased with the hotel in every way. Very courteous staff, super clean, the level of professionalism of the staff is just incredible. The room was always well cleaned and made when we came back. After reading about shoebox size room in Tokyo, I was worried about the large size of the room. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the room. Our room was on the SPG floor, 14th, so we had a nice view. The bathroom was huge with a generous soaking tub and a separate shower. It also has a large counter space and a well-stocked toiletries chest with q-tips, cotton balls, comb, shower cap, etc., it has a gym but I was too tired to use it and reserving my energy for the extensive walking throughout the day. 
Right across the street is a shopping area with Mitsukoshi department store, Starbucks, Baskin Robbin, Burger King, etc. The JR train station is indeed a 7-minute (brisk) walk from the hotel through the mall and a covered walkway with a series of travellators. The subway station is a few minutes walk from the JR station though another mall connected to the station. 
We ate twice at a Hokkaido restaurant across the street from the hotel, on the 39th floor of Ebisu Garden Place. Being from San Francisco Bay Area, we are spoilt with the many great Japanese restaurants we have back home, but we were completely impressed. Fabulous foods and what a view! There are many restaurants on the 38 & 39th floors with reasonable prices.
I wish we have several more days here....",5,2014/07/20

-Excellent decor and it is fairly new compared to the other hotels
-Very close to a metro stop
-The area around it is good as well
-Rooms are large, clean and quite impressive

2,REDACTED,en,3909,"After a little glitch with my reserved room allocation everything was arranged.
The staff is well trained and goes out of its way to make you happy...just ask and they try to make you happy.
The concierge team deserves a special mention of excellence we needed them for reservations, advice, tourist information etc their info were very precious they follow up and provide you with printed confirmation. Make sure that you ask for a room on high floor and imperatively CITY VIEW. Some rooms face two adjacent buildings and believe us this was quite depressing fortunatelly our room was changed but only after 48 hours because the hotel was full (they said) . Location is great far from noisy and crowded areas like Ginza or Shibuya. The surroundings are absolutelly marvelous and connection to Subway and JR train are very easy ...there is a skywalk that takes you to the station in 12 minutes. Across the street you have a super modern plaza with plenty of restaurants, shops and the famous Mitsukoshi department store. The Buffet Breakfast is good and plentifull according to western standards unfortunatelly the Japanese part of the buffet is quite limited when compared to other hotels in the same category. We would gladly return to this place...By the way The TV remote control is very complicated to use",4,2014/07/01
2,REDACTED,en,3910,"I had a good stay at the Westin in Ebisu (near Shibuya) on business a couple of years ago. It's your typical Westin, with great Japanese service. Only issues I can really identify: the hotel is a little older, and not in poor shape but a bit rough around the edges; and getting to the gym requires a decent 5min walk outside the hotel proper (even though its a great gym with pool once you get there). Still, not a bad hotel at all and good value for money.",4,2014/06/26
2,REDACTED,en,3911,"The Westin in Tokyo is a very typical Westin style hotel. Nice, comfortable but maybe a little not so up to date design.

Stay for a business trip recently and enjoy my stay. Staff was polite, friendly and ever so helpful.

Breakfast had a limited variety but was generally still alright with me as I don't take a lot during breakfast. Miso soup and the french toast were my favorites.

Location was alright as it was within walking distance (5 minutes) to the Ebisu station. There is a grocery store at the basement of the complex across the road and couple of eateries in the same complex.",4,2014/06/24
2,REDACTED,en,3912,"Let me preface by stating this was my second business trip to Tokyo and stayed for 19 nights. 

Don’t be fooled by the dull shell of this hotel as lacking any style, comfort or amenities. My stay was idyllic. 

Front of house was well prepared for my arrival and were very courteous. And all spoke English very well which is truly helpful. 

Rooms were a bit small though provided all the amenities you expect from Westin. I would recommend for the hotel to get some better black-out curtains for the oversee travelers. 

The gym left something to be desired as it was over packed with equipment but is open 24 hrs. Preferred guests do get passes to adjacent health club which has lap pool, sauna and ample gym space. This was a true luxury. 

Location of hotel is in trendy Ebisu/Meguo area, with an array of restaurants, bars in walking distance. The area in general was tranquil for Tokyo, yet you still get a very good feel for the life in the city. 
Japan Rail and subway is only ten minutes walk and can get you to/near all of the Tokyo sites. 

Would definitely stay again and would recommend to most of my friends and coworkers.",4,2014/06/20

Everyone working here seems very proud of their job. Always willing to help and extremely polite. Nice clean roomy rooms with great view of the whole city. Since it was my first trip to Japan, what blew my mind was the toilet!! Very hi tech with heated toilet seat and various water jets for your ""convenience""!! Breakfast is as expected but can get pretty busy... The spa is definitely worth visiting. Although nothing amazing, the staff will def win you with their politeness and professionalism. The gym is a bit small for the size of the hotel with very basic equipment.
Overall a great experience. I will be going back for sure,on my next visit to Tokyo, because to be honest with you, you cannot ask for more from a business hotel!! Big bravo to the staff. Thank you for taking care of me!",4,2014/06/20
2,REDACTED,en,3914,"We just spent three nights at the Westin while Husband was on business trip and I tagged along with our two boys (ages 4 and 6). The room was impeccable and spacious. Service was outstanding, with bell boys helping me with our bags every time we came back. And consistent with Japanese culture, they help with a smile without expecting a tip. Location was great, right on Yebisu Gardens, so boys could run around and we could grab a quick breakfast at one of the bakeries. 

Biggest bonus of the stay was the Westin kids club. They brought the boys kid-sized PJ's, slippers and toothbrushes. They were so excited, they wore their PJ's every night. 

Since we have relatives nearby, we did not try the restaurants, but everyone told us their Chinese restaurant is one of the best. Hopefully we can try it on our next visit!",5,2014/06/19
2,REDACTED,en,3915,"Stayed in this hotel in mid May, hotel is located in Ebisu area. Metro Station is called Ebisu, hotel is situated 15 minutes walk away from the station. Though it is a bit aqay from the station, the walk is actually fantastic as you need to walk through Yebisu Garden Place which is great for walk around especially in the morning. The place consist of department store, food outlets and beer station. Every 1st and 3rd sunday of the month, there is a market at the garden place with a lots of fresh fruits and vegetable for sell from local organic farms. 
Hotel staff was friendly and helpful and offer good service. There is a charge when you want to use internet in the room but free wifi is offered in the loby areas. Ask for special breakfast rate upon your check in which is about half of the original price.",5,2014/06/12
2,REDACTED,en,3916,"When booking Hotels for Japan we were surprised to find that most of the hotels had a fairly classic look to them and a lot of them were quite old hotels. 

The Westin Tokyo would probably be one of the largest hotels I have ever stayed in. It is massive - quite traditional and grand but absolutely immaculate. There was a beautiful scent throughout the entire hotel (White Tea I think?) and everything was spotless and shiny. There are several restaurants, a bar, shops in the basement, pool, gym, conference rooms (which appeared to always have events on at them) and so on...

Room was spacious, quite large in fact - again a bit of a surprise for Japan. Again, they are very clean and tidy just a pretty old fashioned style but for a good nights sleep and plenty of space nothing really to fault.

Basement level connects directly into a local shopping mall and on to a train station which is handy, it was raining when we visited to this helped a lot. 

Mostly friendly staff, happy to help out with suggestions etc - thank you to the lovely girl at concierge who suggested an awesome ramen noodle restaurant for us which we would never have found or gone into without her telling us to - very local,,, one of our best meals in Japan.

No free wifi in rooms which is a bit of a let down. We had come from St Regis Osaka who did offer this and it is something that is becoming more and more common these days, I would usually expect it.

All in all a good hotel.",4,2014/06/11
2,REDACTED,en,3917,"It was a cold and rainy day, and our clothes were wet from the day before. The hotel kindly let us check in early at 12 noon, and also gave us a late check out. We no longer had Starwood Preferred Gold status (didn't make status for this year), but the hotel still treated us very well. We used points + cash for the stay, which is a great deal because you get a big room with all the amenities -- it has to be one of the larger rooms in Tokyo.

It was raining. We arrived at Ebisu Station on the convenient Hamone-Yamoto line and walked all the way underground to the hotel so that rain never hit us. Walk to Ebisu Garden Place using the moving walkways, stay to the right and go down an escalator towards ""Glass Palace"". Go past Baskin Robbins ice cream and Burger King, and enter on the basement floor of Westin (door on your left). Your head should always be covered, although at one point you're exposed to the wind.

Because the weather remained rainy on our visit, Westin was a perfect visit as we used this underground passage to get food (Robuchon, Lawry's, Dean & Deluca are some high-end options, but they've got a ton of Japanese ministalls and bakeries on basement 2nd level and local Japanese restaurants.) We also used the gym a lot -- again very much appreciated on a rainy day. It was also enjoyable to soak in the large bathtub.

I had originally booked a small budget room in Tokyo but am so glad we splurged on the Westin. It's nice to be able to stay in and enjoy some English-speaking TV channels, a gym, etc and not be forced to go out. It turned our vacation into a relaxing staycation. Westin was truly a home away from home for us.",5,2014/06/09
2,REDACTED,en,3918,"Japan is a service oriented country and the staff at Westin certainly takes it a notch higher. Professional, attentive and genuinely interested to please. My room was a good size - western sized standards vs typical rooms in japan hotels tend to be small. Room was comfortable except maybe not as well lit, there was only 1 floor lamp and an entrance light. Two other lamps at bedside and one table lamp but still I would prefer something brighter -if I turned on all the lights the middle part of the room was still dark. Breakfast was a Good selection, not the massive spread one sees at other hotels which is sometimes a waste. Location is a little troublesome, about 10mins walk to the JR, and about 15mins to the subway which seems like a mile if one is very tired already. Also from Haneda airport access is not as straightforward as only 2 airport buses a day goes to Westin and vice versa. With a large luggage my choice (other than an expensive taxi ride) was to take the keikyu train from Haneda to Shinagawa and taxi from there. I departed in the same way, and with heavier luggage it is quite challenging navigating the Tokyo train stations as it's very busy. While there are more buses to Narita, it is a two hour bus ride. I chose Westin for its proximity to my office, otherwise for vacation I always stay somewhere else with easier airport/subway access.",4,2014/06/07
2,REDACTED,en,3919,"We had stayed at the Westin Tokyo on a couple of previous trips, and stay has been lovely each time with almost all aspects consistently good.

The hotel is located near the Ebisu station on the Yamanote line. It is still a bit of a walk from the station to the hotel's front door, so If you are coming from Tokyo or Shinagawa stations with luggage in tow, I strongly recommend you take a taxi. That said, the location is great. There are a large variety of restaurants in the Ebisu Plaza area that lies between the hotel and Ebisu station (including some very good Japanese restaurants on the 38th & 39th floors of the Ebisu Plaza tower). There is also a Mitsukoshi Department store (with a great wine shop), and some very interesting shops a short walk away towards Meguro.

The rooms are well appointed and comfortable, and of a good size. My adult daughter's jaw dropped when she saw the bathroom in our room: a lot of red granite, large soaker tub, separate shower stall, an impressive array of toiletries, and so on. Executive Club members also have access to the executive club lounge on the 17th floor. 

The breakfast buffet (in either the executive club lounge, or the main floor) is excellent with a wide choice of offerings for both western and Japanese style breakfasts. Some of the nice touches include fresh sqeezed orange juice, and fresh berry juice and omelettes and eggs made to order while you wait.

Other than the buffet, prices for food are typical for Tokyo, which is to say they can be a bit pricey, and the serving sizes are much smaller than most westerners will be used to. This is a quibble, especially as I do not think we have every had anything to eat at the Westin that was not outstanding.

Staff are polite, efficient and helpful. Most hotel staff are quite fluent in English, but there were a few where I found it easier to speak Japanese. There is no business center, but the concierge staff will do what they can to assist. 

Will we stay there again? We are already planning to.",5,2014/06/04
2,REDACTED,en,3920,"Always exceptional, the service is faultless . The rooms are spacious and well equipped. A typical business hotel decor but when on business you want comfort and convenience and you certainly get that. The location is great and an easy taxi ride from Haneda.",4,2014/06/03
2,REDACTED,en,3921,"This is still on our around the world trip on Star alliance. This hotel was up to full 5 star standards. The breakfast buffet had so many selections, you could’ve eaten all day. We had record snowfall and we enjoyed watching it from the executive lounge. Restaurants were all fabulous. We were able to eat at the Japanese restaurant and the French restaurant. The gym also was one of the best gyms, I have seen. I really enjoy working out. The location was great, walking distance to the train and many other selections of shopping and restaurants. I would totally recommend this hotel or anyone visiting Japan Tokyo.",5,2014/06/02
2,REDACTED,en,3922,"We have previously stayed at the Ana intercontinental and thought we would give this a try. It's a bit further for my husband to get tot he office but the area around is very nice with lots of great options for food all within a short walk. There are good transport links with Meguro and Ebisu stations close by giving access to metro and JR lines. 
The hotel does have a strange (smoke?) smell in the public areas and slightly in the rooms even though we had a non smoking room. Maybe as non smokers we are more sensitive to this... The rooms are of a good standard. And bathrooms spacious. 
Service generally was excellent, everything we requested was actioned quickly and efficiently. Breakfast was a great selection and there is a small garden if you are early enough to sit in..... If you can avoid the smokers sitting there.... 
The lounge for SPG members has a pretty miserable selection of snacks compared to other SPG lounges and the wine is dreadful. Also during my stay people were using it to conduct interviews which was quite distasteful. Listening to people discussing their salary requirements in what is supposed to be a SPG environment was not what I expected to have to listen to. The hotel did apologize for this but I don't think i should of had to complain. It shouldn't of happened in the first place.",4,2014/05/31
2,REDACTED,en,3923,"I've stayed at many top hotel chains around the world (Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental, St. Regis, JW Marriott), but the Westin Tokyo stands out to me as one of the best hotels around. Not only was the room and location terrific, but the service was outstanding. I do believe that the combination of Japanese dedication to excellence and great management create something very unique. Employees that enjoy what they do and not just because they should if that makes any sense. 

I particularly want to acknowledge and praise Ms. Matsuura at the Concierge for taking the time and effort to find a pediatrician on a Sunday for our daughter who wasn't feeling well.

The hotel and the staff's attention to detail and willingness to ensure our stay was pleasant was amazing. The fact that the check in counter has airport style islands that the staff can walk around to hand you your receipt with two hands and a bow is something very unique to Japan. 

We also stayed at the Westin Osaka, which was also very nice with one big difference. It seems that the Westin Osaka's management did not prefer that the employees accept tips. Understandably in Japan where excellent service is expected. However, I feel that the Westin Tokyo employees were more encouraged to accept tips if offered. Although they all refused, they did accept less reluctantly than the employees at the Westin Osaka. I believe this may be due to the General Manager of the Westin Tokyo being far more employee centric than cultural centric. 

I'm sure most of us writing or reading reviews have had service jobs at one point in their lives. When did any of us ever completely refuse a tip that a customer insisted we accept based upon our knowing we provided good service. I believe that the Westin Tokyo's management feels this way too. 

Therefore, even though it is not expected that one tips in Japan, my feeling is TIP! You won't get any less service either way, but you'll see a lot of gratitude from employees wherever you go. We're all human.",5,2014/05/31
2,REDACTED,en,3924,"Please, Westin corporate must mandate smoke free policy worldwide. Even with non-smoking floors, the air quality is still awful around the public areas.

Just realized after this stay that the Westin heavenly bed here is not as comfortable. The bed is too firm. Also just realized that the hotel did not have a pool for recreational purposes; it is contracted with a health club next door.

Booked two nights on C&P and the other two on prepaid rate. Applied SNA and both SNA requests were not confirmed and SNA returned; bummed. Was upgraded to a corner suite on the 21st floor (top floor just below the 22nd restaurants). Breakfast is still available on the first floor in the terrace restaurant and child 3 and under is still free (child 4 to 12 have to pay 2,200 yen; compared to 3,600 yen for 13 and older). I don't like the corner room, since it appears to be ""smaller"" than a regular room (although it is the same square footage at 452). Since the NEX and suica deal for non-residents ended on April 1st, 2014, we opted to take the Airport 'limo' bus since we have some heavy luggages. However, the ride takes more than 2 hours since there are 4 stops before getting to the Westin which took more than half an hour.",4,2014/05/29
2,REDACTED,en,3925,"The three of us visited in mid-April, with one person needing a wheelchair. Doorways and halls were all large enough to accommodate, and elevators (6, I believe) were quick to arrive regardless of the hour. Our room had a large bathroom with a deep bathtub, as well as a glass walled, walk in shower with lots of room (accessible showers were hit and miss during the rest of our trip, learned to use the term ""universal"" in the last hotel we stayed at for a wheelchair accessible room). The room itself was spacious, well lit, clean, and quiet. They gave us a 3rd bed before we even arrived - with a real mattress - but once we determined that the 3rd wasn't necessary the man who escorted us to our room immediately secured and removed it from our room. There was no wait for our luggage to arrive.
The exercise room is nice, but clearly not a high traffic area. There are perhaps 2 of each machine, but the area didn’t feel confined.
Staff was very helpful and friendly, and very quick. The continental/buffet breakfast was fantastic, with a huge variety of food (more Western than Eastern, but both included), everything kept well stocked and fresh during my visit. The cleaning service left a bottle of water for each occupant every day, which was a huge help for me, personally, as water isn't an automatic service when dining out the way it is where I live and I often forgot to purchase water while we were out and about.
I very much appreciated the location; we were off of any main roads so it was quiet. It's right across the street from a department store and large public area, so we had access to a grocery, restaurants, cafes as well as some fast food and a convenience store (this one is in the taller building, behind the elevators). There isn't a lot of signage, so we kept discovering new places every day - down stairs, around corners, inside one of the larger buildings, or at the back of one.
The walk to the sky way that led to Ebisu station was very nice, and the sky way itself has conveyor walkways. If you're bringing a wheelchair, though, I recommend NOT using the walkways unless you'll be walking on them, they're not wide enough to allow pedestrians to squeeze past a stationary chair very easily. There's more than enough room on the path between conveyor walks. One thing to keep in mind with a wheelchair – at Ebisu station there is no elevator between the train platforms and the ticketing level; **ask for help if you cannot use an escalator or stairs without assistance.** This was the only station we encountered this issue with during the entire trip.
Between the quality of the rooms, the breakfast, the location, and the service, I'd very much recommend the Westin Tokyo to anyone considering using it for a quiet, comfortable trip. My companion responsible for booking our trip mentioned that this location was even nicer than she'd anticipated, after staying in other Westin locations. If you want to be closer to the energy and hustle more typical of touristy areas, with less of a walk to the train, consider another location.
My *only* complaint is that wi-fi was not free throughout the hotel - only in the lobby area. Other wise, 1500 Y per day for access from your room. This was the only location that charged an additional fee for wireless access during our trip, and the speed wasn't very good during the one day we elected to try it out.",5,2014/05/27
2,REDACTED,en,3926,Very nice hotel with perfect service. Room was spacious and decorated with class. It's Michelin one star teppanyaki restaurant was also a great plus. Connected to Mitsukoshi department store and Ebisu garden malls. My most favorite hotel in Tokyo.,5,2014/05/27
2,REDACTED,en,3927,"Location: Not most desirable to tourists. located in a self-contained area 10 mins walk to Ebisu Station.
Service: Check in staff shows impatient attitude which is rare in Japan during my extensive travel experience in Japan. The check in staff remised to pass my baggage tag to the Bell, it took quite a while to get my baggage delivered to room. I had to call Bell to look for my bag. That's not usual Westin hospitality. 
Concierge only got one staff during my visit, English skill is not up to par, She did not offer concrete knowledge on sightseeing and transports. Concierge looked so reluctant to give me a copy of a tourist brochure that I asked for with full maps and info of many Suburbs. To be fair, before my arrival, the concierge has provided efficient service on my restaurant bookings. 
No turn down service. 

Room: Spacious room comparable to Conrad Tokyo who claimed to have the biggest room size in Tokyo. Décor is a more conventional style, yet functional & clean. A good size desk with ample drawer space under TV. Closet is spacious with iron& board. 
Older hotel offer very limited electric outlets . 
Bathroom, separate tub & Shower, very thoughtful toiletries amenities. I am impressed (2 bandaids and black cotton buds). Wifi is free in Lobby, Wifi is only free for SPG gold members in room.

If business meetings in Meguro area, it is ok. For tourists, if service shows more amicable attention, it is an option. I stayed two nights after business meetings , I move back to Hyatt Regency where I receive much better personal service.",3,2014/05/25
2,REDACTED,en,3928,"We stayed at this hotel for 8 nights in Tokyo. The staffs are very attentive and helpful at all times. The bathroom and hotel room was very clean and spacious. We had a gorgeous view of Mt. Fuji from our hotel room. The location of the hotel is really good with a 10-15 minutes comfortable walk to the Ebisu station through the skywalk. There is a small shopping centre opposite the hotel with some cafes and restaurants so it is very convenient. Breakfast is provided both at the executive club lounge with amazing views and at the lobby. There is a much better variety of food and juices/drinks at the lobby buffet breakfast. Overall, we had an enjoyable time at the hotel and we're looking forward to staying there again!",5,2014/05/20

I'm a vegetarian and at the lounge the staff went the extra mile and prepared special food for me off the room service menu.

As always, the uniquely wonderful bathrooms steal the show.

Good concierge service and well managed property where people take pride in what they do.",5,2014/05/19
2,REDACTED,en,3930,"Stayed in Tokyo for a total of 8 nights, and spent 3 nights here. Definitely, one of the best that we've stayed at. We got upgraded, rooms were clean and spacious, wifi was strong and works well (Important since I had to be connected constantly for emails). Breakfast was available either on the club level or the ground level restaurant, and even though it was packed, service was not affected and in fact on par with Westin standards. 

Close proximity to the subway station, and also a fully sheltered walkway available from the hotel directly to the subway station (ideal for rainy days). No lack of amenities nearby, pharmacies, 7-11, convenience shops, malls and restaurants. Perfect, all in all a good stay and would return.",5,2014/05/17

The bus from Narita takes 1 1/2 hours or so, but the bus to Haneda was only 1/2 hour.",5,2014/05/16

The hotel is conveniently located between a small shopping mall and a metro station that provides access to the rest of Tokyo. The facility is modern, attractive, and spotlessly clean. The staff couldn't be more friendly or helpful. A side trip to Kyoto, including reserved ""green car"" tickets on the bullet train(shinkansen) was arranged by the consierge without difficulty during Japan's golden week, the busiest travel period of the year!

The gardens surrounding the hotel are lovely, only surpassed by the quality of service received. We stayed on the club floor and had access to the club floor lounge with yummy evening appetizers (including soup and desserts) and a choice of beer, wine, champagne and cocktails. Breakfast could be taken in the club floor lounge or as a buffet in the lobby restaurant. The food and service were excellent. Would highly recommend this beautiful hotel.",5,2014/05/02
2,REDACTED,en,3935,"We stayed in the Westin the last three days of our Japan trip. Before we stayed 6 nights in a different chains hotel in osaka. Both 5 stars, but the hotel in osaka had more ""soul"". 

The Rooms of the Westin are great, the bath is very nice. The service is technically perfect, but we kind of missed something. After discussing this with my with we called it ""soul"". The staff was well trained and executed their jobs very well. But it did not feel ""authentic"".

But back to important things for the traveller:

Breakfast is great for ""continentals"". We missed a bit more japanese offering at the enormous buffet. The eggs, whatever style you picked, were perfect! Fresh fruits every day. The only thing for improvement is the speed in which the coffee or tea arrives ...

If you arrive from ebisu station take the skywalk on the west exit. Immedeately right hand side when you come through the exit gates in the station. Takes about 5-6 minutes to get to the hotel, but even with three heavy cases it was easy going.",4,2014/04/28

The Ebisu train station is a short pleasant walk away using a covered moving sidewalk, and from this station you can easily access the main tourist areas of Tokyo (especially if you have a JR Rail Pass). We found the hotel to be excellent, with pleasant english speaking staff, beautiful rooms and lobby. The lounge on the top floor had an incredible view.

2,REDACTED,en,3947,"We stayed 5 nights at this hotel for our sightseeing trip to Tokyo over new year’s eve. We picked this hotel primarily due to it offering an executive floor and a lounge, so indeed we picked what the hotel calls an “Executive Club Room”. 

Coming from Nartia; the hotel is easy to reach and fairly well connected to public transport. It is set in a fairly peaceful part of Tokyo and overall location was a nice mix of practical (good connections) and quiet. As with all around Tokyo: surroundings are safe and clean. Check-in in was quick, efficient and polite; as with everything in Japan.

The hotel lobby is fairly big and seems always busy. While the hotel describes itself featuring a “classical European” décor; I would rather call it American. A mixture of dark woods, black marble and gold dominate the appeal and it does have some charm of the 90ties. Yet that’s what you would expect form the Westin brand anyway and everything was well maintained. So no critique here; just know what you are up to.

Our room was fairly big and arranged on the corner of the hotel tower. The cheesy decoration went on in the room and there was nothing in the room that would tell you that you are in Japan, it’s all western. Yet again we expected that and as a western tourist; it can be relaxing after a day in the city. Biggest asset about the room were the beds: wonderfully comfortable! It did feature a little lounge area, desk, huge TV and a nicely appointed bathroom: everything you would expect form a 5* chain hotel. 

Since we had a room on the Executive floor, we had access to the club lounge. The lounge itself is standard (and again: exactly what you would expect from an American hotel chain). Breakfast was a mixture of Japanese and western continental, starting your day with a view over Tokyo is however rather pleasant!
Drinks are being served in the afternoon in the lounge; and supposing also snacks, although that was nothing more than a few crisps. Overall selection of refreshments, drinks and snacks was disappointing.
Biggest problem however was the continuous overcrowding. Indeed; 4 out of 5 days we were refused access to the lounge in the afternoon. Considering it is a service I am paying for; unacceptable to me. On the 3rd day I complained at the reception and asked to be presented with an alternative for a service I have obviously paid for and within 3 minutes I suddenly was granted access to the lounge.

Overall this hotel does what you expect it do to: provides a good night sleep in a clean and comfortable environment with friendly and efficient personnel. They however certainly don’t go the extra mile and I felt being presented with exactly what I had paid for. The issues with not being able to get into the lounge is however too much for me. Also disappointing: no free wifi or access to the Spa. 

I would recommend the hotel if you need a good night sleep, for a holiday, I would probably also look for suitable alternatives.

Tokyo needs and deserves the upgrade of the NEX to Super Fast. When I can I fly Haneda, but that is not always the most economical choice. Meanwhile back at the hotel - I love the 'old school' feel of this hotel, the broad smiles and the efficient service are a joy - and the walk to Ebisu through the Garden Place starts the business day well for me.

2,REDACTED,en,3953,"Really nice hotel, great rooms, great beds (firm, but not rock hard). Good views of Tokyo from the upper floors (e.g. Tokyo tower).

Location-wise, the hotel is about 10 minutes' walk from Ebisu metro station (by the time you've walked the 5 minutes to the trains from the entrance nearest the hotel), which makes it easy to get around the city. It's a roughly 4 km walk to Tokyo tower, which is pleasant enough to do. The hotel has a large garden at the back, with a traditional wooden building in it, and water features, which might well be nice for a walk. Unfortunately it only opens to guests at 11:00, which meant I couldn't visit it, as I needed to leave earlier than that each day.

Buffet breakfast was excellent: good variety, and (a really positive point) the selection varies slightly each day (e.g. the flavours of the smoothies that they offer), which made it great when staying for several days.

Room was fine, and the shower in particular was very good: a rain shower with a decent pressure behind it.

Staff were generally helpful, including being very happy to change which newspaper was hung on my door in the mornings. I did try to negotiate for late check-out, but only managed to obtain 1.5 hours extra. Given I don't have a ""right"" to late check-out, I'm not unhappy, but it's worth bearing in mind that they appear to be strict on this, so don't assume that you'll be able to negotiate many more hours!

Overall a great hotel: would definitely stay again if in Tokyo.",5,2014/03/14
2,REDACTED,en,3954,"Pros:
1) Good location: 10mins walk to Ebisu station, 4 stops away from Shinjuku, Tokyo, etc. 
2) Linked to a basic shopping centre (Mitsokoshi), Lawson's convenient store, etc.
3) Great breakfast spread, and also a great lounge, serving variety of drinks. 

Cons:
1) Staff obviously chooses certain guests to ""delight"". I was told that there were no rooms to honor my platinum upgrade as rooms on the executive and suites are blocked for ""other"" platinum guests who have yet to checked-in.
2) Front desk, concierge and exec lounge makes eye contact but no offering of assistance. Eg, when i first checked in, everyone was just looking at me and no one offered to help. But when a japanese guests comes, everyone seemed too eager to bow and smile and nod away. Same thing happened at the lounge, japanese guests were seen taking drinks (can drinks, wine, etc) away out of the lounge into their rooms. Staff even refilled a guests cup with red wine and see him off to the lift?!?

Overall, i can forgive lapses in service, but discrimination don't seat well with me in anyway. 

But if you couldn't care less, and you're just not bothered by such attitudes then this is great hotel.",3,2014/03/14

2,REDACTED,en,3956,"My honest review of this hotel is that it is clean,good service,helpful staff but the only down side is it is far away from most of the main streets or locations.. Almost every point of interest is almost 40-60 minutes away whether you're taking a taxi or the train... But all in all the stay was ok",4,2014/03/01
2,REDACTED,en,3957,Its one of these standard hotels where there is nothing to talk about really but that is probably a good thing. Food is ridiculously expensive as always but you have the option to just cross the street and find plenty of other food options.,3,2014/02/27

2,REDACTED,en,3959,"For 18 years I have had to stay here for business. It was old fashioned then and has stayed frozen in a faux 19th century Parisian brothel design. The staff are easily confused, the food is poor and the ambience sad. It only stays in business for the captive corporate audience across the road. Beware the very odd selection of vegetables that appear with any cooked breakfast.",2,2014/02/12

2,REDACTED,en,3961,"I am a platinum member and my membership number is xxxxxxxx017. I am writing this in regard of my injury, which was happen on January 11, 2014. I did stay in Westin Tokyo on January 10, 2014 for one night. I went out for shopping in the morning January 11, 2014 and on the way back, I used basement entrance B1F unfortunately the glass door broke when I used my hand to pushed it. There were several cuts on my hand and arm. However, I did not inform the hotel staff because I have to rush back to airport for a flight back home. I have to bear the painfulness during the flight which is almost 7 hours and when the plan touched down. I rushed out from airport to hospital and end up which many stiches on my hand. I then called Starwood call center and ask them to contact hotel but end up with a letter saying that it was not their problem. What they did is just an offer to upgrade for my next stay at this hotel. I try again a second time but the reply was the same with additional info that the CCTV is not cover that area and Westin Glass Door WAS THERE FOR 10 YEAR AND NO ONE EVER BREAK IT!!!. I was very disappointed with the answer and their professionalism. I did not want to break their glass door and I think nobody want to do so. All of all what I ask for is a fairness judgment and to inform the hotel to maintenance their facilities. I have wasted my time to send and email, I cant write anything for a week and who will be responsible for my lost!!!!!. I am going to write a complaint to write an email to OECD. This is totally unacceptable. I don’t have any faith in Starwood anymore!!!!!",1,2014/02/08
2,REDACTED,en,3962,"We were looking for a nice, western style hotel near Haneda Airport (we were arriving late at night) for a very short stay and the rate was especially good for a Westin. It was a relatively quick, but slightly expensive (~80 USD) taxi ride. The hotel was typically nice Westin (especially the bed & room), with local design influence. They have a very nice garden area with cherry blossoms in season. The staff were helpful and friendly with all aspects of the stay. The restaurants were very nice and the food good. Located in Yebisu Garden Place, there are also many things to see, do, eat within a short 5-minute walk, including the local train station. Would definitely stay here again if arriving via Haneda.",4,2014/02/01
2,REDACTED,en,3963,"Westin Tokyo is not central, but in a beautiful part of city right beside Ebisu. Easily accessible to all major sights by a short train ride, with train station an easy short walk away. Lots of great dining options very close by in the top 2 levels of Ebisu complex right across the street, with great views, very good food, lots of variety and reasonable costs (by tokyo standards). There's even a Joel Robuchon directly across street, and bakery in lower lobby.

Rooms are very clean and spacious with comfortable Westin beds. Decor is dated and needs a facelift visually, but everything is in good condition.

Lounge is very crowded, and a wait is usually necessary to get a table. Food choices are limited, and lounge staff do not replenish often, or seem to care, making the lounge experience quite disappointing.

Front desk service is good, quick, and efficient. SPG platinum recognition is also good. 
I would return to Westin Tokyo for my next visit.",4,2014/01/31
2,REDACTED,en,3964,"However it's not in the center, can be the best choice in Tokyo. The rooms are huge, the bed is really good... The only negative point is the service at breakfast - however the meals are really good - try the waffel with banana jam:D 
Direct shuttle from both Haneda and Narita, few minutes to Shibuya, 20 minutes from Shinkansen station at Shinagawa. 
One of the best hotels, I've ever been.",5,2014/01/25
2,REDACTED,en,3965,"we really enjoyed our stay here. Rooms were spacious, clean & the staff were extremely friendly & helpful. Wifi was not free in the room , but was free in the lobby so this was no issue.

location was great - easy to get to the subway & reasonably close to all the main attractions

highly recommended

as an aside - the food hall of the department store across the road sold the best strawberries that we had ever tasted!",5,2014/01/18
2,REDACTED,en,3966,"Stayed at the Westin Tokyo for one night for a quick - but important - morning meeting. The people here are absolutely fantastic - so helpful and pleasant. Two examples - I needed a slide deck printed out and the concierge did them immediately in color for no charge. Then I asked if you can see Mt. Fuji from the hotel and someone brought me up to the restaurant to see the view. Everyone is there to help, and they act as if you made their day when they are able to help. 

They arranged for the bus back and found me in the bar to tell me it had arrived. These small details make a huge difference in a stay. The rooms are comfortable and clean. Two notes - it is a 10 minute walk to the train station. And there was some night construction when I was there.",5,2014/01/18
2,REDACTED,en,3967,"I go to Tokyo every year and this time I tried this hotel for the first time. From their description, 7~10 minutes walk from JR Ebisu station via ""sky-walk"", I assumed it was connected to the station but it was not. You need umbrella if it is raining and not so interesting area to walk. Surrounding shops and restaurants are very much limited and rather somber. If you have only few days in Tokyo to explore, I don't recommend.

The level of staffs are surprisingly lower than expected. Concierge lady needed to use PC to tell me how far to go to the nearby museum... it was a local attraction. At the check in, I asked if I could use my Delta Platinum status to get some benefits, and answer was no. I could not, because I booked through online booking site(Rakuten which is like Booking.com), not from Westin's website, I did not know. It was ok, but the desk staff explained and complained in a very much annoyed way, saying ""it's always so, we always tell them to notify their customers clearly, but..."". I felt very sour from how he answered, if only he said ""very sorry, but you cannot, because we have to give special price to them"", then I could have easily understood.

It's only the matter of attitude. This kind of experience I did not expect from Westin, and even it was in Japan, where you can get almost always better services than any other countries!!

I decided to leave earlier than original date, moved to another hotel. If service was better, I would have stayed, but with not so convenient location why I have to bother?",2,2014/01/17
2,REDACTED,en,3968,"This is one of, if not the best hotel experience I have had in many years. The property was beautiful, well maintained and well located. The staff was everything you could want. The room was great; I especially liked the tub and shower combo in the bath. The room was quiet and the service was wonderful My only disappointment was the tv channel which only had CNN with japanese over the English, making it difficult to understand the English..The hotel should provide a guide for all the nice amenities and gadgets in the room. Some of us only know how to flip a light switch.",4,2014/01/16
2,REDACTED,en,3969,"If you're looking a be a tourist in Tokyo this hotel is not close to the shopping districts. The Yebisu Garden Place Shopping is located directly across from the hotel. I would recommend staying here if you like being away from the noise and distractions of the city. Meguro is an quiet area with very little traffic and easy access to public transportation.

The room was very clean and large. I had a 2 oversized single beds deluxe room with a vanity, desk and sitting area in the room. The beds were much firmer than usual not as ""heavenly"" as I'm use to. The bathroom includes a class shower and separate tub. The shower was a bit small for my comfort, but the tub made up for it. No it was not a garden or Jacuzzi tub, but the tub was deeper then most household tubs which allowed me to relax after my busy day walking through Tokyo. My one complaint was that the room (821) was drafty. I closed the windows and I could still feel the cold air coming into the room. I eventually had to keep the heat at 80 degrees just to be comfortable. 

WIFI is not free, but the hotel does off a package that includes free WIFI and breakfast. I would definitely recommend guest to try to get the package. The breakfast was buffet style, but there were Japanese, Western, and European options so everyone can find something to eat. I recommend that you arrive early to get a table and avoid the crowds.


Please make sure that you have dinner in the Yebisu Garden Place (the shopping plaza across the street). The restaurants on the top floors have a breathaking view of Toyko at night. 

Finally, the staff is AMAZING! Very friendly and helpful (like most Japanese). I really enjoyed my stay here.",4,2014/01/16
2,REDACTED,en,3970,"My review focuses on the fitness options, the Executive Lounge service, the restaurant and the Imperial Suite.

We decided to upgrade to the Imperial Suite, which is the sprawling (2,200 sq ft) and luxurious accommodation one would expect (great views of the city, precious objets d’art including a sculpture of the birth of Venus behind the bed, a separate living room, kitchen, dining area, dressing area, jacuzzi etc.) but the unique selling point is that <it has its own sauna>.

<Fitness options>: Starwood Platinum members can visit the Club at Yebisu Garden Place (5 minutes’ walk away) for free. This is a fantastic full service gym with all the facilities you can imagine (swimming pool, racquetball courts, yoga classes, hot pools, all the resistance machines and cardio equipment you could want, plus some free weights). It has limited hours on the weekend (does not open until 8 am, for example). The Westin Workout on the 4th floor, however, is open 24/7 and is actually decently equipped for a small hotel gym. They have 4 treadmills, 2 cross-trainers, 1 step machine, 2 recumbent bikes. They have a small collection of Lifefitness resistance machines including chest press, shoulder press, pull down, leg curl, and leg extension. There are also two benches and dumbbells to 20 kg. There are two Swiss balls and a small area for stretching. There are towels, earphones and water but no changing facilities. 

<Executive Lounge>: when I was there it was never over-crowded, the staff is friendly and most speak very good English (in contrast to the main reception, in my experience) but they need to raise their game in terms of happy hour snacks! It was the least enticing spread I have ever seen in any executive lounge anywhere in the world (and I am very experienced in executive lounges!). There was a pitiful selection of potato chips, nuts, some cheeses, mysterious cold cuts and bread and then some unappetizing warm snacks like corn soup, little ramekins of roasted sweet potato, etc. Really more like rations in a Soviet era canteen. But there is a decent selection of wines and spirits in free pour. 

Lastly, and a major reason for my “average” review is that the hotel seems to have some service issues throughout, exemplified by the restaurant where breakfast is served. They had hotel guests waiting on a recent Saturday morning for 30-45 minutes to get a table for breakfast. By the time we were seated, they were closing down the restaurant. One would think that keeping the buffet open in an overcrowded hotel restaurant is the least they could do. Serving breakfast to guests is one thing a hotel must get right, as we have nowhere else to go, certainly not in this quiet and removed area of Tokyo.",3,2014/01/13
2,REDACTED,en,3971,"I stayed here with a group of friends and we were generally satisfied with our experience. The location couldn't be better, and the hotel is situated right near one of the main subway stops. The brunch buffet isn't bad and features an array of both Japanese style and Western style food. The main issue we had was the unexpectedly small size of the beds - but we learned that this is standard in Japan. I was in a double room with two other women and sharing a ""Japanese-sized"" double bed with another person is an experience I'd rather not have again.",3,2014/01/02
2,REDACTED,en,3972,"We stayed at this hotel for four nights during our first ever trip to Japan. The hotel is easily accessible and close to Ebisu subway station and not far from Shinjuku station by taxi (for Narita Express access). 

The hotel is located across the road from the Ebisu Garden Place, complete with shops and restaurants. In December, when we were there, there was a beautiful Christmas lights display. 

Our room was very spacious and comfortable. The layout of the room was perfect and we cannot fault it. Our stay went seamlessly.",5,2013/12/31
2,REDACTED,en,3973,"This is a one of the Westin with the most classic decor i have ever seen--it has more the feeling of an old Ritz than of a Westin. The place is so married to traditions, that it even includes a fax machine in every room! :-)

Besides that, the hotel is in a great location for exploring Tokyo.",4,2013/12/30
2,REDACTED,en,3974,"The westin is located in a great place, with the train station conveniently nearby. As you can expect from the japanese, the service was excellent! They were able to locate my lost item and had it neatly packaged and delivered to my new hotel, saving me a lot of pain. Finally, you can get a nice view of the Tokyo tower from your room, which is always a plus.

",5,2013/12/30
2,REDACTED,en,3975,"I stayed at this hotel twice and both times the property exceeded my expectations. It is in a fairly convenient area with lots of food options and the concierge is extremely helpful. Being a platinum SPG member, the fantastic breakfast buffet was complimentary. I also had the pleasure to visit their spa area. One downside is that the hotel does not have its own pool. I am an avid swimmer and it is inconvenient to go to an affiliated gym/fitness nearby.

I would definitely return to this property but next time I will take the Narita express to Shinogawa and then opt for a short taxi ride (rather than the airport bus which takes 2 hours each way!)",5,2013/12/30
2,REDACTED,en,3976,"I stayed here with my husband in December 2013.

Having arrived on a bus from the airport, we were initially dubious about how far out it was (it took 2 hours to get there). Upon arrival we were impressed with the outside and the interior - it was old fashioned, but comfortable and as it was December there were some lovely christmas decorations on show. 

The hotel were quick to check us in, reminded us that we had arrived early, but luckily our room was ready. 

A delightful Japanese lady escorted us to our room, struggling with our bags. 

Our room was on the 10th floor - it was spacious with more than adequate extras and an almost ridiculously big bathroom! The toilet wasn't as space age as I was expecting (which I was really rather glad about!).

So the hotel interior and room were great, really pleased with those.

Just a short walk from the hotel is Yebisu Garden Place, which was lovely - a really clean and tidy creation full of coffee shops, food and restaurants. There is a shopping mall there, with a delightful food hall in the basement. 

Having discovered that Excelsior offer the nearest to a decent british tea I was thrilled that there was a chain in there!

A short walk to the nearest station - easily accessible for most things. It was one stop on the JR Yamanote Line to Shibuya, which we went to most nights. (You can get day passes on the JR Line quite reasonably, we did this and paid extra for any useage of the Metro that we needed - not sure if it would have been better to get the pass that included both).

The biggest perk of the room was the view of Mount Fuji on a clear day! Really humbling.

The worst thing about the hotel was the overpriced food - we ordered a few things from room service and were genuinely shocked about the price. Choosing afterwards to get food out and about. You also had to pay extra for wi-fi - which was a bit of a shock!",4,2013/12/29
2,REDACTED,en,3977,"Stayed in a 2 bed room and it was a lovely 1 week stay. Room was your standard size, but amenities and toiletries were very sufficient. If you forgot your razor, toothbrush, toothpaste, comb, etc. you won't have to worry as everything is provided for you here. Cleaning staff did a great job of getting everything cleaned right away. 

Concierge, front desk, and bellhops were all very polite, efficient, and helpful. They certainly made sure you were welcomed and your stay was as pleasant and stress free as possible. The dining options in the hotel are okay, I had dinner at the restaurant downstairs and it wasn't bad, but a little overpriced. I suggest trying the dining options across the street for more options and affordable pricing too...except for Robuchon, but that's worthwhile.

The location of the hotel has its challenges, but it can be overcome. 

Within walking distance there is a Mitsukoshi there. Not your largest version of one, but it does have all the adequate shopping needs, restaurants, and food market on the lowest floor. Mitsukoshi is also located within the Yebisu garden where there are a ton of restaurants, a convenience store, and a bank. I was really excited about the fact that they had 2 Joel Robuchon restaurants across the street AND a Robuchon bakery too. If you're looking to make reservations, I suggest going through the hotel concierge. The restaurant's website messed up my reservation and sent me to the wrong restaurant. It wasn't a big ordeal, just a little confusing.

Ebisu station has both the JR and metro lines. Accessing both can be a walk, but along the way are a lot of automatic walkways to make the process less strenuous on the legs. The Ebisu JR station will be the first you see. From there, Shibuya is the next station, Harajuku is your 2nd station, and then Shinjuku is your 4th station. Pretty quick accesses to popular destinations. If you need the metro line, you would need to walk down further through the mall and down escalators before you hit the metro. Ebisu is only on the Hibiya line so for some destinations I had to make connections. If you want to hit tourist area, Asakusa took the longest to access, about a 40 mins trip on the metro excluding walking time.

So while the location has its challenges, you can overcome them by managing your time and having a good map, which the hotel provides. The hotel's overall environment, service, and efficiency is well worth my time and money spent. Would I stay here again? Absolutely! Would I recommend this? Definitely.",5,2013/12/28
2,REDACTED,en,3978,"This is my second stay this year. Hotel is located in the neighborhood of Ebisu, easily accessible to the subway and JR line via the covered walkway. Ebisu is a quieter district as compared to the touristy Shinjuku and Shibuya area but it's not an issue for us since we prefer some quiet time after staying in major city centre during the entire leg of our 9 days long japan trip. The airport limousine from both Haneda and Narita airport also drop you off directly at the hotel's entrance.

Check in was prompt and staff was courteous. We had an issue with our door latch upon check in. But this was resolved promptly by both housekeeping and engineering. On my last stay, we got a room facing Tokyo Tower and this time round we had a room facing Ebisu Garden. On a clear day, we can get a nice view of Mt Fuji from our room. Room is spacious, which is a plus point since most hotel rooms in Japan are typically small. Room is adequately equipped but the deco seems a bit outdated. The only downside is that there is limited selection of English Channels on the TV.

Hotel has several dining options available. The nearby Ebisu Garden also provides an alternative dining option has it has several restaurants, cafe and fast food outlet available. There is also a Starbucks and small supermarket in the mall. Overall hotel experience was good and I'm glad that service was still as good as my previous stay.",4,2013/12/27
2,REDACTED,en,3979,"I stayed here for four days while on a business trip. The staff was very attentive and helpful. While you should learn some Japanese when visiting Japan, you don't need it for this hotel. The staff is fluent in English. Expect rooms like you would find in a Westin in North America or Europe. The rooms are spacious including the bathroom. While I didn't get a king sized bed, the oversized single bed was fine for one person. The hotel is conveniently located across the street from shopping, dining and the train station. Taxis are also readily available at the hotel entrance. If you are traveling to the business district in the morning, taking a taxi may the quickest and easiest (but not the cheapest) option. The trains are packed in the mornings, and the streets are relatively empty and quiet. I got to the business district in 10 minutes by taxi in the mornings, but the return trip in the evenings took 30 minutes. It is a long drive from NRT using the Airport Limousine - about 2.5 hours. If you can fly into HND, it is only 30 minutes from the hotel. You can also take the train from NRT with some transfers, but the trains are very crowded and not ideal for traveling with luggage.",5,2013/12/27
2,REDACTED,en,3980,"We arrived at the Westin as a big group (it was a company trip of about 40) and check in was pretty smooth and so was getting to our rooms. The rooms were the largest during our stay in Japan (but probably the most expensive) with a spacious bathroom and the usual Westin amenities and super comfortable bed. Good placement of plugs around the room for charging electronic devices. It is a bit more ""old school"" looking for a Westin hotel, but nonetheless, everything you'd expect.

The bar staff are helpful and speak good English (plus they make a good drink, albeit an expensive one!). Also free Wifi for hotel guests. The Westin Workout 24 hour gym is always helpful and managed to squeeze in a late night workout after dinner/drinks with the rest of my group. Also noticed that they have a new service where they provide New Balance sneakers/workout gear for those who want to pack light, but I think there's a rental fee for that. 

Ebisu is a nice area, although only got to walk around late Monday night. The train station is a stone's through away and the hotel is right opposite a La Robuchon, if anyone wants to indulge. There is also a Sapporo Beer Garden and lots of cafes around the area, but don't expect it to be much of a bar hopping area, especially on weeknights. 

Didn't get to try breakfast because we got packed boxes on the bus for an early morning flight back home. Not going to judge the breakfast in the hotel based on the takeaway boxes (because they were horrible), but the spread looked good when I did walk around before getting on the bus.",4,2013/12/26
2,REDACTED,en,3981,"Second stay at this property; first stay was during a period of 100% occupancy and the hotel was clearly overwhelmed and understaffed, leading to service issues and a ridiculously crowed club lounge. Second stay was a medium occupancy period, and it was a world of difference; service was uniformly excellent. The rooms are very large and luxurious, the public spaces are grand, and there are quite a few very good and reasonably priced restaurants in the mall just steps away, and the subway is just a short walk, with easy access to all of Tokyo. Prices vary greatly, but usually makes an excellent choice for a points stay!",4,2013/12/25
2,REDACTED,en,3982,"Upon arriving at the Westin, you're greeted by a gorgeous lobby, and friendly, English-speaking staff. The rooms are spacious and well-appointed, and the staff tries to be as helpful as possible. They don't seem to know the area very well though, so don't plan on relying on them for that. The bar staff was extremely accommodating with my special requests, but I feel it should be possible to get food in a hotel restaurant later than 9pm, and I can't help being disappointed by the way the hotel nickel and dimes its guests. It's unconscionable to charge (and such exorbitant prices!) for WiFi in this day and age, and $7 for a glass of tap water at the hotel bar is a bit ridiculous.

Overall it's a gorgeous hotel with very friendly staff, but it's not at all for the budget conscious.",3,2013/12/23
2,REDACTED,en,3983,"As a frequent business traveler to Tokyo, I've tried a few different hotels in easy access to the office. I think this one will become my favourite. The rooms are large for Japan, with a signature comfort Westin bed. Bathrooms are also large, and well-lit, with lots of bench space for all necessities - and an excellent hair-dryer. There are cafes and restaurants within walking distance. Staff are friendly and helpful. As other reviewers have commented, the decor is classic grandiose 80s, but I kind of liked that in a nod-to-vintage-style way. The Christmas decorations were lovely, too - great Westin property!",5,2013/12/21
2,REDACTED,en,3984,"Our family (2 adults, 2 kids) stayed at the Westin Tokyo for 2 nights this past summer. We were on a tour and decided to stay an extra couple of days to see Tokyo. I needed help to make sure a reservation that I had cancelled with another hotel was properly handled and that hotel didn't understand English very well. I asked the staff at the Westin to help me speak with the other hotel desk and they were instrumental in making sure I wouldn't be charged and that my prior reservation was indeed cancelled. While all the Japanese hotels we stayed in on our tour had wonderful staff, the Westin was extraordinary. It was nice to have someone help us plan our day and assist in our arrangements with our bus to the airport. No communication issues here!

The hotel room is larger than what most of Japan has to offer. Since it was our last hotel on our trip, it sure seemed spacious compared to the prior hotels. Nice lobby, room decor and very clean.

Location is great. There's a moving walkway to/from the Ebisu train station and that saved time and effort when walking to the hotel. There's a Ebisu Garden Place shopping area and our favorite was Mitsukoshi. That was a great place, not just to shop but to get food. Lots of great food there.

Thanks again to the Westin Tokyo staff.",5,2013/12/19
2,REDACTED,en,3985,"The surprise of a live plant and a window that actually opened was a great plus. The hotel was decorated for Christmas so I can't tell what it looks like in non holiday mode- my guess is even better. The room was big, nicely laid out, and had a bed that was at or above ""Heavenly"" bed comfort standards. The bathroom has the what I considered a bit ""over the top"" luxury toilet including a heated seat so for travelers in search of that- you are in luck.",4,2013/12/12
2,REDACTED,en,3986,All staff were incredibly helpful and very attentive. Rommel was comfortable spacious with all the mod cons. Nice shopping centre and restaurant across the road and the buffet breakfast was first class. Ask for a higher room with views of Mt Fuji.,5,2013/12/02
2,REDACTED,en,3987,"This is the first time I have stayed in this area of Tokyo or this hotel.

I really enjoyed my stay. This is a very well run hotel with exceptionally helpful staff.

The hotel's decor is a little over the top early 90's Japan meets French Belle Époque. Not really my taste but it is impressive and very well maintained. Everything works and is spotless in this hotel.

I had several challenging requirements for the concierge during my stay and all were handled with aplomb. The staffs' English was first rate.

I ate breakfast in the restaurant and had a dinner there as well. Good food, well presented with attentive, unobtrusive service.

Some reviewers have complained about the location. I beg to differ. There are two stations nearby plus Ebisu Gardens shopping centre across the road. I went all over Tokyo on my day off with superb directions from the staff. No issue unless you have a problem walking 500 hundred yards.

I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and will stay here when next in Tokyo.


",5,2013/12/02
2,REDACTED,en,3988,Visited in Nov. and the weather was quite enjoyable. The hotel is a short walk to train station and a train ride from Omotesando shopping. The Ebisu Gardens surround the Westin Hotel which makes for a peaceful setting in otherwise chaotic Tokyo. The hotel staff are extremely accommodating even providing English/Japanese maps to accommodate subway adventures. There weren't many hotel restaurants although the quality was excellent. The neighboring restaurants made up for any lack in variety. There was no extra cost for kids as they did not require extra bed. Overall nice and friendly staff.,5,2013/12/01
2,REDACTED,en,3989,Stayed in this hotel for 4 weeks for work. The hotel is located within 10 minutes walking distance to the Meguro JR/subway station. There is an underground walkway connecting to the station. Room is spacious. Excellent customer service. Hotel staff speak decent English. It made my 4-week away from home much easier. Highly recommended!,5,2013/11/28
2,REDACTED,en,3990,"We stayed four nights at this hotel and thought the service, location and bed was spectacular (love the Heavenly Beds). The Executive Room on the 17th floor was a great perk and the people there very helpful. The concierge was helpful in all ways, especially giving us directions for a hike to Mount Takeo.
The lobby was beautifully decorated with a Christmas tree surrounded by teddy bears and a working train - very cute. A ten minute walk through the underground tunnel will lead you to Ebisu JR station and also the metro station. 
Adjacent to the hotel is Yebisu place with many eateries (Joel Robuchon deli, yum) and a Mitsukoshi supermarket. We took the free Yebisu beer tour and ate at Sapporo station, great beer and food. We wanted to try the sushi restaurant on the second floor of the hotel as it overlooked a nice Zen garden, but ran out of time. There is also a Family Mart and further along these is a 7-11 where you can use the ATM for international cards. For some strange reason, 7-11 seems to have the only cash machines which will take our cards.

Great stay, great atmosphere, heavenly, really...",4,2013/11/17
2,REDACTED,en,3991,"Spent 3 nights at this hotel and I must say the room was nicer than pictured on the website. It was chosen by the company we were visiting so it was close to their headquarters. The area surrounding the hotel was very pleasant and close to the jr train line but it felt a little isolated. The included breakfast was very nice with fresh juice and many western and Japanese selections. The service was pleasant and everyone spoke very good English. The room could use a little of a remodel and we did NOT have the typical toto toilet with heated seat which I really missed. I have stayed at many Westin hotels and the bed was much more firm than any other westin bed so to me it did not seem to be a ""heavenly"" bed as I am used to having at other starwood properties. Overall I felt it was a nice hotel with a great buffet breakfast but after our 3 nights at this property we moved to the Ritz Carlton which was truly heavenly. Although the Ritz was more expensive it was head and shoulders above the westin in terms of amenities and services. Also the Ritz was in a more active area. I would stay at the Westin again if I needed to be in the area for business otherwise I would probably pay more for the Ritz or another property.",4,2013/11/15
2,REDACTED,en,3992,"The major disappointment was that my non-smoking room smelled badly of smoke. Also the iron didn't work.On positive side it has good food, good business facilities - lovely 17th floor business lounge. Very good service.",4,2013/11/13
2,REDACTED,en,3993,"This hotel was chosen for me by a client that I visiting in Tokyo, as it was close to their office, and I must say it was one of the nicer Westin Hotels that I have stayed at. I have long been a fan of the Westin chain, and will even admit to owning a Westin Heavenly Bed in my home. That being said, the last few Westin Hotels that I have stayed at have been in need of renovation. In fact, one that I stayed at recently in the US, had recently undergone an extensive renovation and still looked quite outdated. The Westin Tokyo, however, was a very nice hotel. The rooms were quite lovely, the beds ""Heavenly,"" and the staff was courteous and professional. While the language barrier was an issue at times, I happened to be there during the World Cup Prelims and struck up a conversation with several staff members about Japan's chances and the good year that they were having. This seemed to break the ice and I found the remainder of my short stay to be both pleasant and engaging.",4,2013/11/11
2,REDACTED,en,3994,"I am a loyal SPG member but this hotel did not meet my expectations. Quite dated, and the bed was clearly not a heavenly bed and I complained and had no resolution. The staff were ok but no one stood out as exceptional. The lobby is grand but this hotel is far from any attractions. I was very disappointed. The first time ever have i not had a great experience at a Westin.",2,2013/11/07
2,REDACTED,en,3995,"We had read the TripAdvisor reviews before our one night stopover in Tokyo at the Westin Tokyo and weren't quite sure what to expect as it has been described as ""dated"", etc.

What we found was a gorgeous lobby, fabulous art deco meets asia decor which was meticulous, amazing, and carried out through the elevators, the floor decor, and the comfortable guest room. 

The service was very good -- in response to an advance e-mail (and having read a review that the hotel had great views of the city), and I had asked for, and we received, a room with a spectacular panoramic view looking back on the city.

We had too short a time to spend in Tokyo....took the metro down to Ginza at 9 in the morning, only to find out that the stores didn't open until 11, which because of our 3 pm flight, didn't allow us time to check them out.

Instead we opted to go back to the hotel, walk through the beautiful Japanese garden, and have a sushi special lunch at the second floor sushi restaurant, an experience that we greatly enjoyed. 

I would recommend this hotel unreservedly. I only wish we had had more time in Tokyo.",5,2013/11/01
2,REDACTED,en,3996,"Hello, I travel to Tokyo 5 or 6 times per year and I mainly use Westin while in Tokyo. I needed last minute help to book a restaurant in Ginza for my clients. Concierge closes at 8pm so I asked the Service Express department (also located in the Westin lobby). I had the privilege of receiving assistance from the Service Express Captain Itoyama-san. Not only was he very courteous, he was very prompt and hand delivered to my room 6 very good restaurant recommendations. I ended up going to one of his recommended restaurants where the food was outstanding and the reserved restaurant room was perfect for my client meeting. Lastly, I received a hand written card asking if the restaurant option was good and if the meeting went well. I normally receive this sort of treatment from St. Regis but now I consider Westin's service to be on par with SPGs luxury collection.",5,2013/11/01
2,REDACTED,en,3997,"This hotel is incredibly elegant. The lobby is amazingly beautiful. It is the second most exquisite hotel I have ever stayed in just behind the Waldorf Astoria in Rome that had real Venetian plaster walls. It's nicer than Ritz Carlton's and Four Seasons I've been in. The room furniture appointments with the wood inlays are stunning. I can not believe there are so many posts that say its outdated. There is nothing outdated about traditional architectural and elegance. This level of worldly charm is timeless. It's like saying Venice is outdated. All I can say is that these ridiculous ADHD people are the same ones that think Apples new iOS7 simple icons are good looking. They must be wanting trendy- hip and edgy Las Vegas style brown, chrome and glass- hotels that WILL be outdated in five years. This hotel is not trendy and that's good because trendy is pretty obnoxious in the long run. Anyone taking offense is probably under 40. You'll understand someday.",5,2013/10/29
2,REDACTED,en,3998,"My family and I stayed in the hotel for one week, and we just loved it. The hotel is beautiful, our room was awesome and the service was wonderful! When I saw all the other hotels in the center of Tokyo, I was even more happy that I selected this hotel. It is quiet and still very accessible to various tourist spots because it is close to a train station, which I encourage my fellow Tokyo visitors, is very easy to learn. The secret is the map of all the various stops and what is close to them! The value for the price is awesome. We've always loved Tokyo and our stay just made our experience even richer!",5,2013/10/28
2,REDACTED,en,3999,"We checked in early, greeted by friendly and helpful staff, which make it a good start.

I have to say is the Bed, Excellent! Always love the 'heavenly bed'. The Hotel is nice located at Ebisu area. This hotel is generous with space (for Japan standard) with a peaceful garden. The decor is a classic Western-Japanese business style hotel. Overall is Comfortable.

The hotel is nicely connected to a mall with a sheltered walk way with a travelator make the walking a pleasant one. The mall Beer/Wine gardens selling local breed oyster HUGE and pice is good! must try.

The down side of all the SPG hotels which is ""NO FREE WIFI"" (in room). Will be great if the room can doll up a bit (modern feel)",4,2013/10/22
2,REDACTED,en,4000,"This is a very clean hotel in a nice location. The rooms are well equiped with the bonus of US plug ins. The restaurants are extemely expensive, but the food was good. Surprisingly good Itialian pasta dishes. The room price was good.",4,2013/10/20
2,REDACTED,en,4001,"The hotel is conveniently located with walking distance to subway about 10-15mins and with several shops and cafes around the area. The room I got was big with a view of Ebisu. Though the decor seems to be very european, however the style is still very Westin. Staff were extremely courteous as expected from Japanese culture. Will definitely return should I visit Japan again.",5,2013/10/17
2,REDACTED,en,4002,I have stayed at 6 or 7 other hotels in Tokyo and I must say Westin Tokyo clearly stands out in a number of aspects. I am a Starwood fan that stayed there 18/19 Sep this year and will visit again end of this month. Service was impeccable and the experience was really enjoyable. Rooms and interior decor are a little bit tired but within acceptable standards. Breakfast was excellent so am looking forward to another great experience there.,5,2013/10/15
2,REDACTED,en,4003,Wish I could give this property a 5 but my room was smoked in which they quickly moved me but still such annoyance...great location just a quick walk to subway which you can do window shopping on the way...and an amazing lounge but do wish they would change up the food.,4,2013/10/14
2,REDACTED,en,4004,The location of this hotel was excellent and the room was large and comfortable. The lobby decor is very outdated and is in definite need if a face lift. The room had also seen better days. It wasn't up to what you'd expect from a North American westin. We did have some concerns with the hotel staff We were told upon arriving that even though we had already booked our room for ten nights that we would now be charged more for the two weekend nights. We argued a bit but their English was so poor we decided to fight the extra charges from home in North America. The charges were reversed once the head office became involved. Overall an adequate hotel but we wouldn't return and we are gold Starwood members.,3,2013/10/14
2,REDACTED,en,4005,"Japanese style service beyond compare is a hallmark at this top class hotel. There are literally no shortcomings to this hotel -- other than the fact that the location is not within easy walking distance to a major shopping area. As with many top class Tokyo hotels, the major shopping areas are a taxi ride away.

The Tokyo Westin is true top class construction, comfort, food and has nice views of the city.
As with all top class Tokyo hotels, the cost is not cheap -- but prices are no worse than same class Tokyo hotels.",5,2013/10/13
2,REDACTED,en,4006,"I've stayed at several hotels in Tokyo and the Westin Tokyo was one of my favorites. The room was enormous and decorated European style with lots of rich woods and marble. The Ebisu location is an upscale residential area of Tokyo which is a tranquil but only a few subway stops from the all night action. The hotel is connected to a mall and next to Ebisu Beer Gardens so there are plenty of things to do close by as well. 
The service was remarkable. We were looking to buy a specialty ironing cloth and the concierge told us that we could buy it at the 100 Yen shop. Since it was raining we decided not to hunt it down. I mentioned to the concierge that we didn't have time to buy ti because we were leaving the next day. Upon checkout, the concierge had gone to the shop to buy the items for us at no charge. Talk about service !!! I couldn't believe it. This is a First Class Hotel !",5,2013/10/13
2,REDACTED,en,4007,"We had the most beautiful rooms on an upper floor of this hotel. The two things that struck me when I walked through the door was how huge and well laid out it was and the magnificent view of Tokyo through three large windows. Our sons' adjoining room was smaller but also laid out well with a desk and sitting area near the window and two full beds. Their bathroom was also smaller than ours but still nice none-the-less. Both bathrooms came with a high tech toilet seat that is popular in Japan. I loved that the seat itself had a warmer built in. Our room came with both a coffee machine and electric tea kettle. As part of having our room serviced each day, both machines would be refilled and complementary bottled water would be left on the cabinet with tea bags and coffee cups. There was also a small refrigerator. Thick cotton robes and slippers were available in the closet when we arrived as well as fresh pressed cotton nightgowns (or light robes -- I wasn't sure which but they were pretty).

From the moment we checked in, everyone in the hotel was so welcoming and helpful. We have dietary limitations and on our first day, the women at the concierge desk in the lobby wrote a note for any restaurant we visited stating the items we couldn't eat. It became our life safer because many of the restaurants that we ate at had servers who didn't speak English.

Our rooms included an full American and Japanese breakfast buffet. They also had a huge juice bar with freshly squeezed juices and smoothies. I loved the breakfast breads, fish (usually salmon) and salad bar (fruit salad and an amazing salmon and rocket salad that tasted so fresh.)

My husband and sons loved the bread pudding. My younger son also loved that there was rice on the breakfast buffet. There is a beautiful little garden behind the hotel that has a peaceful, meandering path.

Although the hotel is not in the heart of downtown Tokyo, it is centrally located and an easy walk to the Ebisu train station. Most of the walk can be done on an indoor moving walkway. Across from the hotel (and on the way to the train station) is a plaza (Yebisu Garden Place) with lots of restaurants and a tented beer garden.

If we ever have an occasion to be in Tokyo again, I would undoubtedly stay here.",5,2013/10/13
2,REDACTED,en,4008,"Delicious buffet, nice rooms and perfect location. Walking distance (10 min) from a main line subway station. Lot of places to eat around the area. Strongly recommend to pay the executive room, as it allows you to use the private lounge with ""hors d'ouevre"" and to use a very nice gym outside the hotel (The Club at Yebisu Garden), we even got to play squash there and we borrowed everything. The next door plaza (Yebisu Garden) is a very nice place to walk around, grab a meal after a busy day and buy lots of things in the department store.
Great staff, great service and we would definitely return.",5,2013/10/13
2,REDACTED,en,4009,"My wife and I stayed at the Westin Tokyo this past spring and it is only now that I have gotten around to extol its virtues. This hotel is bathed in marble and the public areas are almost overwhelming in their beauty. Even the floor of the elevators are done in marble with an intricate design; the craftsmanship is extraordinary. The lobby restaurant has a wonderful buffet breakfast each morning and the dinning room on the top floor is excellent. Hotel rooms in Japan are usually small and very compact but the rooms at the Westin are large and roomy and even have windows which will open slightly which is a feature I personally cherish. The employees are able to assist you and are very gracious. If you are travelling to Tokyo and are looking for a wonderful hotel, the Westin will be a good choice.",5,2013/10/11
2,REDACTED,en,4010,"We arrived early from our BA flight to Haneda and was able to be in our room by 11am which was nice. Clean and very spacious King room with Nespresso machine and capsules and complimentary water.replenished daily. WiFi free in lobby. Nice area with Ebisu subway station about 10 minute walk along moving walkway which has great access to everywhere you need to go. Ebisu subway station is on the JR line which goes round the outer ring of the city so you can travel anywhere with your JR rail pass for free. Initially very daunting (the subway system) but actually very easy to follow and usually 160-190 yen per journey. We didn't bother with a 1 day pass.
The Ebisu JR line goes direct to Tokyo station which is perfect for day trips out of Tokyo.
When we arrived at Haneda airport we took a taxi to our hotel - we were exhausted - and couldn't think about getting there any other way - cost 6,000 yen ! (about £40) - we found actually there is a limousine bus that runs from the airport direct to the hotel 3 times a day at a cost of 900 yen per person!
There a numerous restaurants just ouside and inside the shopping centre at Ebisu stationon we only ate at one which was fine.
Shibuya which is like Piccadily Circus or Times Square is 1 stop away - and you can use your rail pass - which has department stores/shops/restaurants by the thousand!
Go to Tokyo Hands store for everything you can imagine - on 7 floors.
We did day trips to Nikko great for temples and Kamakura for the big buddah.
We then left for Kyoto (staying at the Hotel Granvia Kyoto also reviewed where we did day trips to Nara ( a must) Osaka and Kobe.
The Japanese are lovely gracious people - we had no problem in finding our way around - all the subway staion officers spoke english as did most peple we encountered when needing help to navigate our way across the city/country. We went on September 26th - 8th October. It was warm - 24-26c day 20c-24c night with only one day of rain. Great for sightseeing.
Fantastic trip , ,",5,2013/10/10

The food for vegetarians is not great but the hotel staff tried their best to cater to the need.",5,2013/10/08
2,REDACTED,en,4012,"My husband, daughter and I travelled to Tokyo in July 2013. It was my first trip to Tokyo and yet the Westin wasn't what I was expecting. The initial appearance is like an enormous 1980s pink granite monolith with all of the 1980s excess minus any Tokyo sophistication or Japanese charm. The lobby, indeed the whole hotel is spotless and well run, the staff we spoke to were all extremely helpful, professional and polite however the hotel itself is very dated. Our room was a good size and accommodated three people easily, the bathroom was okay - clean and functional but not luxury by any stretch and needed redecoration to bring it up to today's standards. The concierge service ends at around 830pm everyday, just the time we needed advice on restaurants and dinner as we were severely jet lagged having just flown in from London so got up very late each day. The most memorable moment in the hotel was the cappuccino in the lobby, not for its taste but its price tag of AUD$15 which is the most I have ever paid for a coffee anywhere. I really loved Tokyo and the staff at this well run hotel helped make my week there memorable however the hotel itself is not one I would return to.",3,2013/10/06
2,REDACTED,en,4013,"We stayed at two hotels during our time in Tokyo but if I could turn back time I would just choose Westin. Nice area, subway handy(not too far) and straight forward link to all areas of Tokyo. Just opposite the hotel is a nice little square with a water feature and benches, Yebisu Garden Place's shops and restaurants and off course your local Starbucks. 
Our room was very nice, I used the gym (good) and they even suggest the run route.",5,2013/10/06
2,REDACTED,en,4014,"We really enjoyed ourselves at this hotel for a five night stay. First, the room selected for us as Platinum SPG members was exceptional. And, it was a very nice touch to also deliver a courtesy gift of fruits and chocolate as well. The Executive Lounge on the 17th Floor is wonderful with nice snacks and unlimited courtesy alcohol and soft drinks. The breakfast for Platinums could not have been better ... A++. On top of that, the concierge was very helpful ... sending us off on daily adventures we enjoyed greatly. The hotel is located a few minute walk from some nice restaurants and the JR station (Ebisu) is as easy as you could imagine to get to from the hotel. In summary, a wonderful hotel stay at a great Westin hotel!",5,2013/10/05
2,REDACTED,en,4015,"From the moment you step into Westin Tokyo, the friendly team greets you to a grandeur lobby. The black marble and furnishings infused with Westin signature White Tea compliment the Ebisu-area perfectly to provide a pleasant welcome. The perfect hotel to step away from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. Everything you expect from a Westin.

The concierge team is extremely helpful in not only providing much needed directions to navigate Tokyo, they also provide personalized services to make reservations, assist with shopping enquiries and bridge the language barrier as seamless as possible. You will come to appreciate this if you struggle to understand Japanese.

A fantastic team that continually caters to guests needs at every opportunity to deliver a truly refreshing and comfortable Westin experience.",5,2013/10/04
2,REDACTED,en,4016,"Stayed at the Westin Tokyo for four nights. The lobby and reception area are very elegant and beautiful. The room itself is a bit dated, plain, maybe done in the late 90s early 2000s, time for an update. The room did have a gorgeous view of the city and you can see the Tokyo tower in the distance. The hallway on the 7th floor smells of smoke, like smokers. The concierge tried to be helpful but they gave us lots of incorrect advise, especially about mt Fuji, we wanted to visit it on a Saturday, and they didn't let us know, even though we asked, that the tours don't go on Saturdays, so we were not able to see it unfortunately. They also charge about $25 USD to use the pool!!!! What the heck??? That was disappointing. Also no complimentary wifi in rooms. The buffet breakfast was alright, they have a lot to chose from, but not sure it's really fresh. The hotel was a very close walk to the Ebisu station, although it is really difficult to ask how to get anywhere, we spent a lot of our day confused on how to use the trains, we gave up and just into expensive cabs instead for the rest of the trip. I would probably try to stay elsewhere, maybe in Ginza next time I go back to Tokyo, there was not much action going on in this side of town",4,2013/10/02
2,REDACTED,en,4017,"This hotel has the 80's look but very clean and luxurious. The service was great, and we enjoyed the location. We'd take a 10 min indoor walk to get to the subway that would lead us to the neighboring Shibuya, harajuku 2 stops, shinjuku 3 stops, etc. Joel Robuchon is right across the street, enjoy.",4,2013/09/30
2,REDACTED,en,4018,"Stayed in Westin Tokyo for a week in view of my business trip but also added a few more days of leisure. The hotel has an old colonial charm about it and the interior looks slightly grand and Victorian. The staff are very friendly and speak good English. I had a room which I was surprised by its size, I expected it to be much smaller. I had a good view overlooking the Tokyo Tower and especially enjoyed watching it illuminate at night; through it does look like an imitation of the Eiffel Tower in Paris France. The breakfast spread in vast with a good variety of Western and Japanese breakfast cuisine. The Ebisu train station is about 10 minutes away and linked from the hotel. The area around is practically dead at night so if you need a night snack or something, this is not the place. There is a video store nearby that opens late. Overall I enjoyed my stay and hope that my next visit will be just as enjoyable.",5,2013/09/28
2,REDACTED,en,4019,"Joined my husband here for part of business trip. We usually stay at STRINGS HOTEL in Shinagawa and made sure to get over there for part of this trip as well. Despite the fact that we simply love STRINGS (there was no room for the whole stay there) we were pleasantly surprised by The Westin. The hotel is an easy walk via the SKYWALK from EBISU station which is on the main YAMANOTE LINE and the HIBIYA LINE which makes it very convenient to get almost everywhere. First of all there are tons of restaurants nearby and lots of non business people about. There is a Mitsukoshi Department store where you can buy just about anything and a Famima where you can buy pre-made sandwiches, etc. The breakfast is very good but expensive unless you are in the exec lounge and it's included. There is and EXCELSIOR CAFE nearby for coffee and 'croque madame' if you just want a quick breakfast. Our room had a lovely view of Mt. Fuji and the service was overall very good. The lobby is large and marble everywhere...def a Grand Dame feel. The rooms are fine and clean but the shower was not very big and there was not enough room on the little tiny soap dish to put conditioner, etc. that we brought but that's not a big deal. They had the electric toilet which is always great. Overall we were very pleased with this hotel and we have been to Tokyo often but never spent time in this area before which turned out to be a treat.",5,2013/09/26
2,REDACTED,en,4020,"After the initial complaint regarding room offered we (business colleague, both plat. members) got the suite, which was quite nice. Decor and age leave some wishes open, but the amenities were good. The lounge offering in the evening were very good but the morning buffets has a lot of room for improvement! Beds were great, as usual and the premises very clean. On the down side there's is no mention of other smoking locations beside the cigar bar, where you have to purchase cigars on site. You can also smoke your own in the lobby bar or at the top floor bar!",4,2013/09/23

1. Location is fantastic, very close to Ebisu metro station.
2. Rooms are very spacious but TV sets are surprisingly outdated.
3. Restaurants are nice, I found the prices of buffet dinner too expensive approx. 100 SGD.

Overall, a good place to stay if your office is nearby. It's not a touristic hotel.",4,2013/09/20
2,REDACTED,en,4022,"Stayed at the hotel for 4 weeks and love the hotel. Airport Limousine bus goes directly from Narita and Haneda airport to the hotel and vice versa. If you choose to take a taxi from Haneda airport, it would cost around $65. The hotel is conveniently located near Ebisu JR station (around 10 minutes walk), which also means it is near many food and shopping options. The rooms are extremely spacious by Japan's standards, and very well-equipped and comfortable. Customer service is impeccable as well.",5,2013/09/19
2,REDACTED,en,4023,"The location is a bit of a walk to the nearest train station, but the hotel provides a very warm feel upon arrival. The rooms are spacious enough by Tokyo standards. The buffet breakfast is outstanding (coffee is made fresh per order, as it takes a while to receive). The gym is adequately stocked with basic fitness equipment.

There's a mini-strip mall and a couple of beer halls on the way to/from the train station, as well as a department store.

I'd definitely stay here again.",5,2013/09/17
2,REDACTED,en,4024,"Stayed for 2 nights at the start of a 10 day trip to Japan. Decided to take the shuttle bus direct from Narita to avoid high taxi charges and changes of train after an overnight flight. Even though there was very little traffic (early afternoon) the transfer took 2 hours..

At check-in I was told that the rate I'd agreed did not include breakfast. I challenged this and was abruptly told I would have to pay extra if I wanted breakfast. 15 minutes later in the room I forwarded the reservation to reception and they soon ate humble pie - well they blamed their ""reservation department"". Shame they weren't willing to double check when I asked...

The room was very 1980s style but well looked after and very large by Japanese standards. Lots of gold and faux French decor was very very dated. Disappointly the Westin managememt are so naive that they think it is OK to charge Y1,500/day. I suggest they have a look at some Japanese budget /business hotels (eg Toyoka Inn) which for Y5,000 room rates manage to provide wifi for no extra charge. Frankly I find this extra charging extortionate and an underhand way to inflate profits. Shameful in my opinion. 

The Westin is a bit out of the way. Next to a pleasant enough shopping mall. 15 minutes walk (subways/walkways) to Ebisu station (a long way with bags). Ebisu is only 2 stops to Roppongi and on the circular line so pretty accessible. It's just there isn't much on the doorstep. 

Breakfast was reasonable although one day I gave up asking for coffee after 3 attempts (at a quiet time). Mix of western and Japanese options. 

Doubt I'll return due to the out of the way location but the Westin wasn't bad overall.",3,2013/09/16
2,REDACTED,en,4025,"I have stayed at this hotel off and on over the years - it has been a while since my last visit. The hotel is in a great location on the Ebisu/Meguro border. Ebisu station (Yamanote line and Hibiya Subway)is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel with the availability of a covered passage the whole way. Ebisu Garden place is adjacent with a variety of restaurants and shops.

The staff are helpful and friendly. The breakfast buffet is expensive 3600 yen but you can prepay for 2500 per day. There are some options around teh hotel for breakfast if the buffet does not suit you.

We did have an issue with housekeeping not making up or room by 430pm when we returned from a long day. The issue was addressed promptly.

While this Westin does have have a execuitve lounge with a nice view - it is a bit pricey for the services provided. The Happy hour does have a decent self serve bar but the food is definitely light hors d'oeuvres - The breakfast is more like what you would see at a mid-tier hotel in the US.

The rooms are very nice but feel a little dated. Not a lot of plugs, small TV, older style shower, etc. Very clean and comfortable but still old school. Having stayed in 3 other Asian hotels this trip, this felt the oldest

Would stay here again for the location....

2,REDACTED,en,4026,"I stayed at the Westin Tokyo recently on a business trip for 2 nights. The hotel itself is located in a quiet part of Tokyo, off the busy streets in Ebisu. The Yebisu Garden Palace Complex right next to it complements the European feel that the Westin exudes. The lobby, the faux European style furniture lends a bit of old Europe feel. The bedrooms are larger than most hotels and have all the essentials - flat screen TV, wifi, shower and bath tub. Its got a decent gym but to swim, you have to take a walk to the Yebisu Club where they have a very good indoor pool. Its a short walk and I enjoyed working out at the pool. I'd definately come back...but the only setback is the 10 - 15 minute walk to the Ebisu station. If you are taking taxi then it doesn't matter, but the location of the train station is not very convenient of you want to go around by subway.",4,2013/09/12
2,REDACTED,en,4027,"First business trip to Japan and this hotel made experience very easy. Stayed at this hotel for two nights in mid July. Trip started rough as our flight was delayed several hours so we did not arrive until after midnight. Staff was very helpful in finding a place for us to get something to eat right across the street at Yebisu gardens. This is a large outdoor mall with many food options and some are open late into night thank goodness. The hotel is extremely comfortable in all areas from the lobby to the lounge and the rooms. 
I stayed on an executive floor and the room was quite large and had lots of in room amenities. This floor also gives you access to the executive lounge which has a great full breakfast each morning. Given prices in Tokyo this makes it worth the price of the upgrade. This hotel would be a great option if you had a family member with you on a business run as Ebisu has plenty of shopping and eating places... including a Japanese Beer Garden of all things... its great. Also, very convenient to subway though I did not have time to investigate. I will return again for certain and try to take more advantage of this hotel and location",4,2013/09/05
2,REDACTED,en,4028,"My adult daughter and I stayed here for 7 nights, and had a delightful stay. The staff were all very nice and eager to help. The rooms are large and nicely appointed. The hotel is very close to the Ebitsu subway/train station, and you can walk there under cover via a tunnel to the shopping area and then via a skybridge to the station; a nice feature when it was raining. The hotel is in a suburban area, not very close to any specific sight-seeing sight, but very centrally located to most areas. We liked the suburban setting, because it was less crowded, and we had pleasant walks from the hotel to surrounding restaurants.

We would definitely stay here again if we return to Tokyo.",5,2013/09/04
2,REDACTED,en,4029,"Excellent hotel in a great location. Easy access to the subway and JR lines (only 1 stop to Shibuya). Yebisu Gardens (shopping and restaurants) is immediately adjacent to the property. Large beautifully furnished rooms (able to get a rollaway in our room with 2 double beds). The staff did everything they could to please us. Our room was on the 14th floor facing the city (Tokyo tower, etc.) and a spectacular view. Staying at the Westin you could work out in the hotel workout room OR you had complementary access to the Yebisu Club (very upscale) in Yebisu Gardens. We stayed here 8 nights (broken up by a weekend in Kyoto) and would definitely stay here again.",5,2013/09/03
2,REDACTED,en,4030,"Traveled to Japan for a 3 week pleasure trip in June/July 2013; first week was at the Westin Tokyo in Ebisu. It was HEAVENLY, located near shopping, trains, subways, thus making our first trip to Japan a breeze; get a JR pass when you arrive @ Narita airport.",5,2013/09/03
2,REDACTED,en,4031,"For those that usually stay in Westin properties you will probably be disappointed by this one. 

Staff were fine however the hotel is badly in need of a bit of a refurbishment.....it was like a throwback to the 1980's.

Internet was free however you still needed to select a pricing option and we were told that it would not appear on the bill however on check out it was there....very not Japanese.

Location is not amazing as it is about a 10 minute walk from Ebisu station which is a pretty long distance to walk for Tokyo.

Didn't have the breakfast so can not comment on that. There was a pool however it was at a cost and not cheap...paying to use the pool is not something common for westerners.

Staff were good as were the beds however there are better options out there and the hotel isn't really up to Westin standards.",3,2013/08/30
2,REDACTED,en,4032,"The hotel staff were very accommodating, and tried their best to please me. It is located near a famous department store Mitsukoshi which has a great food court. Guests can use a neighboring health club at Yebisu Gardens called the Club which is complimentary for hotel guests by presenting a invitation card at the check in counter at the Club. People are asked their blood type, and if they have tattoos so, they are not mistaken for Yakusa. The club has a nice pool, squash courts, and golf swing practices.. The hotel has a work out room with Life Fitness equipment.
The bed was comfortable, and the room was very quiet. The hotel has two Japanese, and one Chinese restaurant.",4,2013/08/28
2,REDACTED,en,4033,Very good hotel - great location in Tokyo. Connected to subway and Japan Railways station. Rooms are large. We loved it and recommend it to everyone - especially US travelers (who are used to large rooms).,4,2013/08/17
2,REDACTED,en,4034,"Coming to Japan for my honeymoon, Tokyo was my first stop. The hotel certainly doesn't give you the wow effect, but I liked the overall design, not too modern, classy even. Fairly distant to Ebisu train station/subway - easily a 10-15 minute walk going up and down. Breakfast is amazing, totally worth it. Rooms were comfortable, however I had a note in my reservation asking for a early check-in. Our suite wasn't ready and ended up in a regular room. No big deal, if not by the fact we had to change rooms 3 times in a 4 nights stay. Not-upgraded, upgraded to a suite, downgraded to a regular room. Considering I had to pack and repack, that ruined my stay in a way.",2,2013/08/13
2,REDACTED,en,4035,"I am Lifetime Platinum. 2 night stay over a Saturday and Sunday. Long walk from Ebisu subway (10-15 min) which was a killer with bags. Check-in took 10 minutes for the staff member to tell me that my wife and I would be staying in a room with 2 twins. Checkin was terrible as Westin checkins go.

Perhaps I have been staying in Westin's too long but I have seen the same fixtures for the past 10 years. The lobby here is great but the hallways, rooms feel a bit dated. Shower felt 30 years old. 

Someone was smoking on our floor which was supposed to be non-smoking. Ugh.

Concierge was great.

BTW, we stayed 5 nights before this at the Hotel Ryumeikan near Tokyo Station and loved it. Much smaller room there but tremendous service level, room, shower, bed, incredible. I cannot say enough good things about the Ryumeikan. After our wonderful stay there the comparison to the Westin was all the more stark; the Westin is a big, Western-style hotel and the staff is jaded by the endless stream of people. 

I would not stay here again.",2,2013/08/12
2,REDACTED,en,4036,"Very good location - walking distance to a useful railway station (link to the airport, shinkansen, etc).

Friendly staff and efficient check-in.

Breakfast needs much better organization (20 minutes waiting time is not good, in fact, it was a mess - and the nearby shopping mall including Starbucks is certainly a competitor...).

Internet is charged.

Nice fitness club.",4,2013/08/10
2,REDACTED,en,4037,"This hotel, is really nice, clean and provide a really good service. It's about 10 mins walk from the subway, which you can access by the outside or walk by the inside passage. In the little shopping center, you can find a real grocery store (downstairs, a little bit hard to find) where you can have a lot of dishes already made, and really cheap. The locals shops there, not a lot of tourists. They also have a great place to buy wine from around the world at really good price (close to the burger king). They do not have a swimming pool but you can use the one at the gym close from the hotel (1min)",5,2013/08/09
2,REDACTED,en,4038,"We stayed at this Westin for a few days on a short layover in Tokyo. Overall, we had a great experience at this hotel.

Pros:
-the breakfast buffet is delicious. At 3600 yen, it's a little expensive, but we had a 50% off coupon. They have excellent smoked salmon, an omelet station, and extensive 
-the concierge, Mirei, gave us excellent advice about things to do in Tokyo. She speaks great English and is a fount of knowledge about the city.
-there is an easy limo bus service to and from Narita, about 3000 yen each way. We were able to make reservations the morning of.
-there is a nice, big gym, and you can use the pool at another facility (I didn't use the pool, however)
-all the staff was super friendly and helpful

Cons:
-they charge you to use the business center
-they charge you for wifi in the room
-as others have noted, it is a little far to the train, but it's a pleasant walk and mostly indoors or under covered walkways

Overall, we really enjoyed our time here and would stay here again.",4,2013/07/30
2,REDACTED,en,4039,"Overall, this is a good hotel but you certainly don't feel like you're in Japan. The design is more Versailles. Kind of like ""We want to look really fancy"" So, lots of gold and fancy designs. Not at all sleek or modern- felt a bit like Paris Las Vegas or something. 

Speakign of which- your view could be (if you are in the front) of a fake looking palace that houses the Joel Roubechon restaurant across the street. It all adds up to a strange ""fakey"" feeling to the whole place

The room is a good size, which is notable for Tokyo.

Location wise- the pro's are: a mall across the street (and connected via underground) that has a department store and several places to eat. Also there is a Starbucks right there.

The con: a long walk to Ebisu train station. The good part is that it is via a system of hallways some with moving sidewalks, so it makes the walk easy to navigate and quicker.

If you are coming to Tokyo to immerse yourself in the culture and you want to feel like ""wow, I'm in Japan"", this is definitely NOT the place to come to.",4,2013/07/27
2,REDACTED,en,4040,"Stayed for two nights while on business. All staff members are very courteous and also helped arrange my day trip to Mount Fuji. 
Hotel rooms are large and comfortable with a big bed, nice linen and good pillows. The bathroom was also large with a shower and seperate bathtub. Complimentary toiletries and towels aplenty. The room also had an ironing board and iron which is useful as you don't have to wait for the front desk to bring one to you. 
The food was nice and locally produced beer and fish is high on the menu. Room service was prompt and courteous. 
The room does ahve a flat screen TV with a DVD player but a slight lack of English channels (limited to BBC News and CNN i believe). There are also no international plug sockets. although one adapter is already in the room, when most people will have two or three devices, take another adapter with you. 
The only down side to it was the location. the closest station is Ebisu which is on the JR Yamanote Line (circle line to all the main stations in Tokyo). However, there is a 7 minute walk to the hotel through a covered walkway with travelators. With luggage this would not be ideal. There is the Ebisu Garden Palace right on the doorstep of the hotel which has restaurants and some drinking establishments and a post office.",4,2013/07/16
2,REDACTED,en,4041,"Ok, got a room fairly cheaply. I contacted th hotel about an upgrade (and received one). I asked because I was a gold member so thought us was worth trying. I was sent a confirmation of the upgrade and price- based on what I reserved for in my first booking. When it came to check in, I received the upgrade and I also received the upgrade fee which when combined with what I had paid for my first reservation was more expensive than what I could book online for the same room on the day. When letting the check in staff know this it didn't seem to make a difference or register for that matter. And since I was paying not my company, I told them to cancel the upgrade. I could live without being on the executive floor. A little disappointed with the process and double information from the hotel, but lets just put that down to being their second language.

The room: we stayed in one of the normal rooms. The interior is heavily influenced by classic European flavors, which can give the room a feeling of being old and outdated. It is but you can also see the effort in the room. The room is large, the bathroom is classical with a lot of marble, there is matching writing desk, makeup mirror, chest if draws, bed end chair and lounge sofa. Despite all these items the room does not in any way feel squashed. In fact, in size alone, its probably the biggest hotel room I have stayed in for this hotel chain in Japan. The interior is not my preferred cup of tea but it is still nice.

The view is inhibited by an apartment block next door and gives a feeling of lost privacy but for the price we paid I can't really complain. I think the Westin in Tokyo is regarded as a category 6 SPG hotel. I personally would not say it is any higher than a level 5 but probably more like a 4.

The prices for food and services within the hotel are mind boggingly expensive and should be avoided at all costs unless money is no issue and $40 for a standard burger and nearly $20 for a chocolate smoothie is normal for you. One little thing I noticed, they have a carry bag in the closet that, whilst is a nice touch was also offered at the Westin in Sendai. However there, they also offered a larger bag as well and with a wife in toe was very useful as an additional carry bag to carry all the junk she bought (I mean that in the nicest possible way).

Would I recommend this hotel? Yes. 
Would it be a MUST stay hotel? No.
Location? Fairly good, a little walk from the train staton but certainly not strenuous even with suitcases in toe.

Getting there from the airport: you can take the bus shuttle but I prefer to take the train, much more comfortable and reliable. It will cost more but I think it is worth it.",4,2013/07/16
2,REDACTED,en,4042,"The lobby and the room of this hotel are traditional and elegant. The hotel is in a relatively quiet neighbourhood. I find this to be a respite after a day (or night) spent in the busier parts of town. It is a 10 minute walk away from the JR and then a further 5 minute walk (parts of the walk aided by a motorized walkway) the subway line. It's only one or two stations away from Roppongi and Shibuya. Although you can take the JR line from Narita, it's probably more convenient just to take the limousine bus.

The hotel is part of the Ebisu Garden Place, which has a department store, Starbucks, Baskin-Robbins, health club (which some hotel guests have privilege to use), restaurants, offices, condos etc. There is a Joel Robuchon restaurant and bakery nearby. The hotel's eateries seem overpriced. For breakfast we ate at the St Germain bakery just across the street from the JR station. Coffee and a piece of pastry will set you back $5. You can also have dinner on the 35th floor of the highrise building. There are several restaurants here with expansive views of the city. Ebisu Garden Place also has a decent photography museum and a beer museum.

The hotel room itself is big by any standards, esp. Tokyo. The bathroom has the standard Westin toiletries. Staff are attentive and courteous. We've a nice view of the city outside our window. You've to pay for wifi but it is reliable.",4,2013/07/14
2,REDACTED,en,4043,"Well placed in Tokyo, this station has access to the JR and Hibiya train lines. Narita limosine bus stops here and of course taxis are always waiting. There is also good signage to direct you from the train station. All staff speak English well. A classy lobby, impeccable hallways and rooms. Shibuya district is only one stop away. The concierge staff was helpful with all questions. A bit strange that wifi (although all around Japan) was an add on fee at the hotel. Otherwise you exceeded our expectations",5,2013/07/14
2,REDACTED,en,4044,"First time in this hotel, conveniently located in Ebisu area. Staff polite and efficient, rooms a little tired but clean and well equipped, very impressive lobby and great bar. Japanese hotels are typically expensive and this is no exception, nevertheless, highly recommended.",4,2013/07/12
2,REDACTED,en,4045,"The hotel is beautiful. Somewhat away from center of town. But safe, quiet area. Easy access with subway. Several restaurants in the hotel for all tastes. Across from subway after short walk. Nearby shops and rests. Great gym. Usual outstanding Japanese service. Friendly, polite, helpful and efficient. Staff speaks English either fluent or at least enough to communicate. Highly recommend. Near Ebisu metro station.",5,2013/07/06
2,REDACTED,en,4046,"If you need to be in this location the Westin Tokyo is very good. Your typical Westin quality, good size rooms (I had a suite) and nice business lounge for breakfast and drinks throughout the day.

It is a bit dated in terms of décor and also old TVs (for a Westin) and huge fax machine occupying half the desk (who uses fax nowadays?) 

Service could be improved as I experienced intermittent service: sometimes very good, some other times a bit lacking; however when I complained it was addressed very professionally and to my satisfaction. Their concierge service could be a bit more informative too.

Overall I had a pleasant stay but unless you need to be in this area of town I would choose a different location more central to Tokyo city life, which is fantastic, by the way. Ebisu is a bit far from most interesting places in Tokyo in my experience.",4,2013/07/04
2,REDACTED,en,4047,"Had a seamless experience staying here for a weekend with a friend. I will stay here again on my next visit. My favorite aspect of the hotel was the 5-star breakfast, where I could have everything from Japanese pickles and a green tea smoothie to an omelette, or even bread budding with a divine and not to sweet dark chocolate sauce. Come early for breakfast--before 9--to snag a paper and a booth in the back. On Sunday morning the staff had to open a waitlist after 9:30 AM because of the crowds. 

The room, lobby and restaurants, although not the newest, are gleaming and seemingly without wear. There is a lovely bar next to the lobby where one can have champagne next to a waterfall. The upstairs bar is good for meeting friends or sipping a cocktail alone with a view of the city. 

The room was spotless and cozy with art deco furniture, with a great view of Tokyo Tower. I also liked the separate vanity to do my makeup with natural light. The bathroom had Westin toiletries--my favorite--a bath and ample plush linens. The shower was a little small, however, and I had to place my shampoo on the floor. Everything was well cared for and well serviced. 

We stayed on a club floor and enjoyed the afternoon happy hour, which offered appetizers, wine, cocktails and champagne. Again, come early to snag a table as a waitlist may form on weekends, as it did with us on Saturday night. 

The location of the hotel in unparalleled. Ebisu Garden Palace in itself has great shopping in its department stores and the best French restaurant in Tokyo is next door. Ebisu also earns high marks for convenience as it is located on both the Yamanote train line and Hibiya subway lines, making it uniquely easy to head to Shibuya, Harajuku, Shinjuku, Ginza and Roppongi. 

My only minor complaint concerns the concierge. She mistakenly told us that we did not need a reservation for the Roppong Hills branch for the sushi place featured in ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi."" When we arrived at the restaurant we learned that we indeed need a reservation and could not have gotten in without one. Why not at least call the branch to confirm? Luckily a nice guy added us to our reservation, or we would have been out of luck. 

Can't wait to go back. I am debating whether the club floor was worth it but will definitely get breakfast.",5,2013/06/26
2,REDACTED,en,4048,"As a venue for a business visit this hotel would be hard to beat. The easy access via the airport bus made getting there unstressful. The room was huge, very well equipped and very clean. It was very quiet and the blackout curtains were effective so getting a good sleep (important after a long flight) was very easy. I didn't eat in the hotel as all the options internally seemed very pricy but there were a lot of good alternatives nearby so this wasn't important. The staff that i dealt with were all very efficient and helpful. Overall, I would very much recommend this as a place for a business traveller needing to visit the Ebisu area.",5,2013/06/25
2,REDACTED,en,4049,"Met a girlfriend for a weekend in Tokyo. I LOVED this Westin. The decor of the lobby and the room, and the furniture in the room were all to my taste. Truly five star. The room was very large and comfortable. Wi-fi was fast. We had a great view of Tokyo Tower. Stayed on the executive floor and the lounge was comfortable with good amenities-- food/drinks (although often crowded and occasionally with loud children). We had buffet breakfast (included with rate) in the lobby each morning and it was perfect. Many Japanese choices, as well as some Chinese, an omelet bar, and fresh fruits, salads, juices, smoothies and breads. It was a great way to start each morning. It's not far to the JL subway system and the staff was in general very good. My only complaint would be that the bathroom, while large, had a shower that did not have any space for toiletries --i.e. one small tray that barely held a travel-size shampoo and conditioner bottle with no room for soap, razor, comb or anything else, etc. Having said that, I would still return to this hotel and recommend it. It was definitely a cut above any other Westin where I have stayed (and I have stayed at many).",5,2013/06/22
2,REDACTED,en,4050,"Glad I stayed here instead of another hotel which I had originally intended to. 

It has all that I look for in a 5-star hotel, including prompt and good service. 

The location is really convenient. A 10 min walk away from Ebisu station where you can access a variety of restaurants, super mart and shops.",5,2013/06/16
2,REDACTED,en,4051,"This hotel was an ideal base for my first taste of Tokyo. You can't beat the location and easy access to Narita Airport by airport limousine bus. I can't say enough great things about the Westin Tokyo. I've stayed at plenty of Westins around the world over the years and this easily ranks among the top. The staff was extremely courteous and hospitable. The rooms are a great size. (We were on the ninth floor overlooking the Tokyo skyline, so that was an unexpected surprise.) It really was like a home-away-from-home as I felt like I was sleeping on my own bed (yes, I'm such a Westin fan that I have a Heavenly Bed at home!). Venturing out was a breeze. The Ebisu station is within a quick walk, so access to the main sites by Metro or JR line is quite convenient. The area around the hotel has the Yebisu Gardens and great restaurants as well. Kudos all around!",5,2013/06/14

2,REDACTED,en,4053,"You can get to this hotel easily from the airport as it is the last stop on the Orange Bus from NRT. 

It is a grand hotel and many Japanese people have their weddings at this extravagant hotel. The rooms are a great size - average ""American' size. The bathrooms also had a tub and a shower. It was really comfy and was glad that I stayed there during my trip.

The breakfast buffet had limited American options - but the dinner buffet was pretty crazy for selection. 

This hotel was prime - but very expensive - I paid $7 for an ice tea.",4,2013/06/07
2,REDACTED,en,4054,"I stayed here twice last week, the first time for a few days before going to Nagoya and again on my return. So when I talk about the rooms in this review, I'll refer to two, the first, 1904 and the second, 1014.

I was upgraded to a suite, 1014 on my second stay and it was very spacious, and by far, the best room that I've stayed in out of the four hotels that I've stayed in on my four trips to Japan so far this year. 

I didn't really have time to look around the grounds or amenities including the pool unfortunately!

The decor is quite conservative with a lot of timber so very unlike a contemporary Westin but more in the Sheraton style. A little dated but well-maintained although I found the water pressure in the wash hand basins a tad low.

The variety at breakfast was expansive with a choice of smoothies, my favourite! There were a variety of cuisines so something for everyone.

Service as with most hotels in Japan was excellent.

The Ebisu station on the JR Yamanote line was only a 10 minute amble away with the subway line underneath the JR station. 

I particularly liked the interior walkway through the Yebisu Gardens which was very convenient and provided shelter when the weather turned inclement.

A Mitsukoshi department store was just across the road and particularly in Tokyo, these once dominant department stores were the only place to go shopping but it seems these are disappearing with the changing shopping patterns. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to look through Mitsukoshi but I will do on a future visit.

The Airport Limousine Bus service is available at this hotel and runs on an hourly schedule and perhaps the only drawback of a superb service is the Westin is at the end of a run meaning you need to allow two hours for this trip whereas if you were at the other end of this service, the trip to Narita is barely an hour.",4,2013/06/07
2,REDACTED,en,4055,"The rooms are very spacious and comfortable. The common areas are grand even though the decor is a bit dated.

2,REDACTED,en,4056,"I cannot imagine a better choice for a hurried business trip. The common spaces and the room are quietly luxurious in a not-over-the-top kind of way. The location is a short distance from a train station, and the walk takes you through a park/mall with good restaurants and shopping, including a wonderful ""food garage."" Tokyo is a late-starting city, so you'll likely be taking breakfast at the hotel. It is expensive as breakfasts go, but the food is quite good and the selection excellent. It includes a station with local pickles and such, as well as American and European selections. Good luck getting a second cup of tea or coffee, however, and sometimes even the first one is hard to come by. There is a lovely garden at the back of the hotel. I would not hesitate to return to this Westin.",4,2013/06/01
2,REDACTED,en,4057,From beginning to end the Westin Tokyo was extremely accommodating to our needs from accidentally locking ourselves out (due to connecting doors and the deadbolt) to finding a hospital that would see us early in the morning on a sunday to allowing for a late checkout due to a later flight we really appreciated their incredible service that we will always remember. We would definitely recommend the Westin Tokyo to anyone considering to stay in the heart of the city.,5,2013/05/26
2,REDACTED,en,4058,"The Westin is a great place to be based at in Tokyo. One thing that struck us was how clean it is. The decor isn't new but it is so well maintained I couldn't help but be impressed. The check-in staff were pleasant and professional and I must say that the concierge staff were among the most helpful I have come across. They are really prepared for all your questions and will make their best effort to ensure your ease and satisfaction. 

Their F&B outlets serve food of good standard and The Compass Rose on the 22nd Floor is a great place for a drink while taking in the view of the city skyline by night. 

Their housekeeping is also excellent. They know what to tidy, replace and what to leave untouched. Very professional. Mind you though, if you do choose to ""Go Green"", they won't make your bed or replace your towels.

All in all, I would say it is simply excellent hospitality. Oh, and the beds are a good sleep! 

As for the locale, from the hotel you can conveniently walk to the JR and Metro stations. It is a short stroll through Yebisu Gardens and then through a walkway with walkalators. You'll get to the Ebisu JR line station first and if you carry on you'll reach the Metro station. Ebisu is one stop from Shibuya, two from Harajuku and four from Shinjuku on the JR Yamanote Line. 

Across from the Westin through Yebisu Gardens, there are plenty of eateries, a good Yakitori grill and pub and conveniences. If you'd walk towards the Metro station you'll come out to a bustling area with lots of restaurants. 

I wouldn't hesitate recommending the Westin Tokyo to a friend and I would definitely keep going back.",5,2013/05/21
2,REDACTED,en,4059,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights during a vacation as a SPG member. The location is perfect with a great access to the train station. It is in the Ebisu Garden, a decent neghborhood with fancy restaurants and shops. 

The staff was very nice and the service was great. One big downside is smoke smell...we stayed in a non-smoking area on the non-smoking floor, but the room and floor smelled so awful...I completely believe that many guests violate the non-smoking policy and smoked in non-smoking area. In fact, when we went back home and unpacked our luggage, our cloth smelled so smoky...",4,2013/05/20
2,REDACTED,en,4060,"First of all, wow. I am not sure if The Westin Tokyo need my review, with all these other great ones, but I can't just keep this to myself. My husband and I came across Westin Tokyo because all the hotels in the more crowded areas were booked, but we definitely lucked out because it was an excellent stay. Hands down, one of the best service I have ever experienced in a hotel. That being said, the Japanese are extremely polite and helpful. The hotel is located in quite a convenient part of town If you want to stay out of the hustle and bustle of Shibuya/Shinjuku/Harajuku. The rooms are enormous, especially for Tokyo and to be honest, it was great for a longer stay because you get to enjoy the amenities, even the room service food was excellent. The only thing I missed was the garden, which I did not realize was open until I left the hotel, I wished that it was advertised more in the lobby area so I would remember to check it out. I also wished that the spa was not as overpriced, but then again this is Japan. Other than that, i will definitely come back and stay here when I am in Tokyo.",5,2013/05/17
2,REDACTED,en,4061,"Been to Tokyo 6 times in 2 years and this is the one hotel I keep going back ;-)

Location - Nestled in the Meguro, Ebisu Garden area (pretty much a high-end residential area) - it is easy to reach via the JR rail line (Ebisu Station).Turn right once you exit the railway station and you will see multiple long travelators that moves you towards the hotel area. Exiting the station proper will bring you to a boulevard where several quaint F&B outlets + bakeries are (with great food!)

There's good shopping here and a departmental store (Mitsukoshi). Walking past this boulevard will bring you to the hotel. Total travel time no more than 10 minutes - unless you stop to shop....

On certain weekends, there are even farmers' markets in the boulevard.


Decor / Ambience - The hotel is grand - a classic ornate European decor. Not much intimacy as the lobby is opulent and large - but the service brings back the intimacy of a comfortable luxurious hotel. The hotel is always beautifully decorated during festivals and for me, it always feel good to be back in a familiar environment ;-)

Service - Staff are very polite and service is excellent. The concierge was very helpful in pointing out local events and great places to go - we watched a Sumo Wrestling where Blue Dragon (reigning champion) had his last fight before he retired - all with the help of the concierge. Staff would also offer to help the moment you look a little lost in the lobby.

Room - Very spacious with large shower area. Grand wooden tables. Very comfortable beds. Comes with all the amenities. Housekeeping staff did a great job turning down the room (and cleaning it up after) Toilet Seat comes with a warmer that does you lots of good when you wake in the morning.....especially in winter. ;-)


Restaurants - Again, separate reviews. But these...are a MUST try! Especially Yebisu Teppanyaki (Michelin Starred) and the Chinese restaurant - Ryotenmen.

All-in-all, a great area to relax and enjoy the city. Simply love the hotel and the surrounding Ebisu area.",5,2013/05/15
2,REDACTED,en,4062,"I stayed in The Westin Tokyo for a couple of weeks in April while I was visiting Tokyo for work. I selected The Westin because I'm an SPG member and because it's within walking distance of my company's office in Meguro. Overall, from a business traveler's perspective, it's a perfectly adequate experience. 

Having stayed at many Starwood Hotels both in the US and abroad, this hotel - while very nice to look at - seemed unnecessarily ornate to me. It's a popular spot for weddings, and I can see why, as the lobby and surrounding facilities are quite fancy in appearance, very classic European. I think what you gain in opulent appearance, you lose a bit in terms of comfort and intimacy. 

The location is good if you want some quiet away from Tokyo's crazier spots. I'm not sure I would stay here if I were in full-on tourist mode, as it is a little more remote, but it was good for a business trip. The airport bus from Narita makes a stop here, making it very convenient if you have a lot of luggage - no need to take the train if you have $3000 yen to spend. There's a very large mall - don't worry, it doesn't look like one and you would never know it's there - with many restaurants right across the street (Thai, Japanese, Italian, Brewery, American fast food, Starbucks...) Beyond that you can access all of the many good restaurants that Ebisu has to offer. It's a very pleasant and relatively quick walk to both Meguro and Ebisu Stations, and that pretty much connects you with everything (including a lot of other reasonable food options).

The room was spacious (I had two full beds with a small table, two chairs and a makeup table [a nice touch].) The bathroom was very nice, with a large separate tub and shower, the usual Japanese toilet set up, nice toiletries. The room also came equipped with a DVD player - and a rice cooker! Bring DVDs, friends, because the television options are limited unless you speak Japanese, and if you are suffering from jet lag, you might want something to watch. In room wireless was reliable and, despite the annoying sign up with prices that makes you feel like you are being charged, it's actually free (at least it was with my room.) As with many hotels, they need more outlets by the desk area (no adapters needed if you are traveling from the US). All that said, I'm not sure why but it just never felt entirely comfortable, probably because I was expecting the usual Heavenly Bed (the bed is fine, but it's not the Heavenly Bed you get in the US). It was fine, very nice, but not particularly comfortable. The housekeeping staff did a great job of keeping the room fresh, and they were very quick and friendly.

The fitness center is very nice, but not included unless you are an SPG member, so sign up! Three or so treadmills, elipticals, free weights, some nice weight machines, water available. A nice, if small, gym with a pretty street view. I only missed a pool for lap swimming, but apparently there is a larger health club in the complex across the street that has one and you can access it for something like $20. 

The bar and restaurants are ornate and thus feel a bit less accessible. At the risk of sounding like an ugly American, it's not the type of place you're going to feel comfortable going to the lobby dressed very casually. I spent a lot of time at restaurants across the street in the large mall area, which had a more causal feel (and were decidedly less expensive.) Room service is outrageously expensive, but that is the case in most Tokyo hotels. When I did order room service, it was very good - especially the ramen!

The service is very reliable and friendly; everyone works hard to speak English if you are unable to speak Japanese - but do not expect them to understand everything you say. This can be an issue if you run into more complex logistical problems beyond finding a good restaurant or getting a taxi. I was frustrated by an exchange I had around using US ATM cards* (mine didn't work in any of the surrounding ATM machines, and they kept telling me to go to the 7 Eleven, which also didn't work.) I had a hell of a time explaining over the phone to guest express what a lint roller was.

On using foreign ATM cards: It's important to note that The Westin *does not* have an ATM and does not allow credit card advances or facilitate cash exchanges. I was instructed to go to 7 Eleven in Ebisu, or take US currency to the bank in the mall across the street during the week. This was hugely frustrating, as my card(s) did not work at 7 Eleven, or in any of the ATMs in the mall. I found both their guest express representative and concierge to be somewhat unsympathetic in this situation and not particularly helpful as I don't speak much Japanese. THE GOOD NEWS: There is a JP Post Office in the mall across the street (3rd floor, rear of building) and many JP Post Offices have ATMs that accept most if not all foreign ATM cards. They are open from 8am to 8pm on weekdays and also have weekend hours. The Westin staff would do well to offer this information up front, rather than sending their guests to 7 Eleven, and I found it very odd that I had to figure this out myself; after about an hour of back-and-forth, I returned to my room in frustration and consulted the back of my Time Out Tokyo guide, which provided the tip on the post office. Thank you Time Out!",3,2013/05/10
2,REDACTED,en,4063,"Very conveniently located on the JR rail line in the upscale Ebisu Garden area. An Airport Limo bus stop so also easy to access from the airport. As a platnium member the buffet breakfast was complementary and is not to be missed. Many Japanese items - many different fermented and pickled items, miso, etc. Also a good assortment of fruit and juices, as well as western items and pasteries. The executive lounge had a nice assortment of appetizers in the evening. Very large bathroom and spacious room. Service very attentive.",5,2013/05/08
2,REDACTED,en,4064,"We stayed at the Westin from March 28 to 30 during the first leg of our Japan tour. The room was very spacious and we were given a room facing the Ebisu Garden. I love the bathroom too. It was very spacious and had a separate shower. The interior is on the masculine side but it didn't bother me. Our flight was delayed for more than 2 hours so we missed the last limousine bus from Haneda. However, it was easy to get to the hotel. We took the Keikyu train to Shinagawa station and just took a taxi from there. The taxi fare was very reasonable even with the midnight surcharge. We didn't avail of breakfast because it was quite expensive. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants at the Ebisu Garden and at the Ebisu station. You can get good breakfast at a fraction of the price at the hotel. The check in and check out were a breeze. We didn't encounter any problem at all. Plus the Concierge took care of sending our suitcases to our hotel in Hiroshima. Really superb service.
Overall, it was a very enjoyable stay. If only they offer free wifi in the room. The wifi at the lobby was free but I prefer to do my research of the train schedules, places to visit etc in the comforts of our own room.",5,2013/05/03
2,REDACTED,en,4065,This was my second stay at this property. It is located in a quiet upscale neighborhood with close walking distance of a JR rail station. It is decorated in a very European manner. So if you are looking for a true Japanese experience it may not be for you. The staff is very friendly. speak and understand English and are extremely service oriented. It is a great place to stay.,5,2013/05/02
2,REDACTED,en,4066,"Did not stay at this hotel, but visiting a friend living nearby. The Narita airport limousine bus ends at this hotel, so getting to and from the airport is a breeze. The location of the hotel is right at shopping and an easy walk to offices and the trains. Did visit and drink at The Compass Rose on the 22nd floor. A great view sitting at the bar watching the lights of Tokyo come on and just taking in all that ambience. Nice range of drinks on offer and friendly staff who do have good English language skills.",5,2013/05/01
2,REDACTED,en,4067,"Stayed at this hotel for business. A nice property centrally located. Service was fantastic, staff was very accommodating. Breakfast buffet was packed full of fresh food with many choices. I highly recommend this to anyone traveling on business.",4,2013/04/29
2,REDACTED,en,4068,"I stayed there for three nights,every morning at breakfast the staff kept on nagging me for the vouchers even i gave them at the front desk.The worse experience,on my last day breakfast - in the middle of bfast meeting with client,the inexperience staff kept on approaching me about the bloody bfast voucher and dragged me to the reception just to ensure that my room is included the bfast. Finally they found out I am entitled for bfast.Its really unacceptable and ot ruined my whole day meeting.

Lack of technology in the hotel system,they have to do all manually. I had really bad experience and will not reccomend this hotel if you want to receive lousy services.",2,2013/04/23
2,REDACTED,en,4069,"Stayed at the Westin on my 2nd time in Tokyo, at the end of my trip. Perfect location for a relaxing end of my vacation - it's just outside the hectic teeny bopper areas but you can get to them in minutes on the JR if needed.
The rooms & amenities are luxurious & the staff super friendly - so certainly made for an extra special feel & hotel. Would thoroughly recommend.
Tip - make sure you get a map of the area as soon as you arrive at the hotel & use the basement walkway to get to the station quickly.",5,2013/04/21
2,REDACTED,en,4070,"This hotel is super clean and glamorous, yet the best thing about it is the location. It's an easy walk to the Ebisu JR station, which is quiet by JR standards, yet is on the key city circle Yamanote line. If you have had an overwhelming day of Tokyo sights and sounds it's so nice to come back to the quietness of this hotel and the surrounding Garden Place department store and restaurants. The fitness club in Garden Place is also available free for hotel guests, which is a great club with pool, squash courts, saunas, showers, lockers and a good gym. The buffet breakfast is also great! If you get the executive club rooms then be sure to check out the afternoon teas and happy hour on the club floor. Also take your breakfast on the ground floor as it has far more selection than the club floor. I love this hotel!",5,2013/04/21
2,REDACTED,en,4071,"Great hotel, great value. Our room (two double beds) was large, very clean, felt fresh, had quality furnishings. Very convenient location for tourists who plan to do a lot on the west wide of Tokyo (Ebisu, Shibuya, Shinjuku). Concierge service was excellent and very helpful in making reservations at restaurants. All service personnel were excellent and spoke excellent English. Good gym. For someone used to US and Europe hotel rates, I think this is a great value at $260 / night.",5,2013/04/20
2,REDACTED,en,4072,"Very clean hotel with a very attentive staff. Rooms are impeccably clean, and so is the whole hotel for that matter. The rooms have reliable WiFi at a cost per day. The location is simply perfect - it is quiet and with several local restaurants within 200-300 meters. The Garden Mall is across the street, and so is the subway. I will stay here again.",5,2013/04/16
2,REDACTED,en,4073,"Travel March/April 2013. Family of 4 ( kids: 13 and 7) on holidays. Good location, 10 min. walk from Ebisu station ( Yamanote line takes you to most of the Tokyo must-see-points). Nice shopping mall very nearby. Clean, spacious rooms. Heavenly beds - not so heavenly. The douvet cover must be mix of cotton and polyester ( it felt so!), just the flat sheet which they use under it, is good quality cotton. Club longue privillages were a real incentive. Restaurant was a week point ( we just had breakfasts). Especially on weekend you have to wait to be seated even for 25min. Restaurant is old, dark, old fashioned and definitelly needs a renovation. Chairs' upholstery must be more than 20 years old with threads fraying around. Selection of food pretty limited although tasty and good quality. Pretty inefficient restaurant service, you have to wait for ages to get your hot drinks. Kindness of the staff was a good balance and compensation for limited English.",4,2013/04/14
2,REDACTED,en,4074,"The service of the staff at this hotel is among the best in the city. I have previously stayed at the Conrad, and felt that the staff at the Westin really raises the bar on service.

When waiting for check-in, I was greeted by a staff who served me chilled white tea. Even when I was waiting for the hotel shuttle after check out, I was served tea in the lobby. The staff here is generous and does not dispense service only to the staying guests of this hotel, which is another indication of their commitment to service. A casual request to a staff in the elevator for an extra key-card was taken up as a personal mission, and the same staff delivered the card to my door minutes later. This is a great example of the staff here take ownership of the service that they provide.

The concierge needs some work on printing maps and directions for guests - the concierge had to photocopy a old guidebook just to show me the way to the Meguro river. Concierge at similar level hotels have access to programs specially designed to print out a neat sheet for guests requesting recommendations/direction.

The room is generously sized, and the bathroom was luxurious for Tokyo standard. Access to the pool requires an additional charge, but this is standard in Japan. Beware that the walk to JR Ebisu is around 10 minutes each way on a movable walkway.",5,2013/04/10
2,REDACTED,en,4075,"Truly love this hotel for the quality and cleanliness of the rooms, the utter infallibility and helpfulness of the staff and the awesome location! The easy access to the JR Ebisu station without going outside is a huge boon during one of Tokyo's frequent rainstorms. Unlike other hotels, the concierge staff and business center staff at this hotel are truly useful and worth engaging for any needs you may have. They produce results competently and quickly. While I wasn't ever upgraded as a Platinum, I was always given a good room and my status was recognized.",5,2013/04/09
2,REDACTED,en,4076,The Westin Tokyo was a wonderful hotel. It was in a great location and was a very pretty property. The rooms were well appointed and spacious. The staff is very friendly and very helpful. I had contacted the hotel via email several times before our arrival to help us make the most of our 24 hours in Tokyo. they were very helpful and responsive.We used the concierge to point us in the right direction for things we wanted to see. I would recommend this property and will stay there again if my travels take me back to Tokyo. Also the breakfast buffet was also very nice. The area around the hotel was very quite on the weekend which made it nice for walking around. The front desk was also able to arrange for the limousine bus to take us back to the airport.,5,2013/04/09

The front desk receptionists and the executive lounge staffs are very welcoming and helpful. I did not try the restuarants on offer at the hotel as there arw plenty of good restaurants at the adjacent Yebisu Garden Place. The hotel has 24-hour gym facility.,4,2013/04/04
2,REDACTED,en,4081,"I stayed a night at the Westin Tokyo flight to U.S. got cancelled and I had to wait for the flight the next day. 

Room: Very old. It's tiny (but considered large in Tokyo I guess) and it's so old. The style is so 1980s and I felt like everything I touched might break. For such amazing location and iconic hotel in Tokyo, the room could use some touch-ups. 

Service: Great! AMAZING really :) I was there in September and after trolleying my luggage from the airport in Tokyo's summer, I felt nauseous. While I sat waiting for check-in, a manager on duty presented me with iced water. It was such a thoughtful touch and I was so impressed with how observant and attentive the manager was.

Breakfast: I enjoyed it a lot. Thanks to my companion's SPG Platinum status we had our breakfast on the executive floor. The view was nice and with a great selections of both western and Japanese breakfast. 

Hope they renovate all the rooms soon but will be returning for amazing service!",4,2013/04/01
2,REDACTED,en,4082,"In the 4 nights spent till date, we haven't had a reason to complain. Rooms are large and the hotel is very well located near Ebisu station. Staff is competent and friendly. Haven't been able to savor the restaurant other than breakfast, which is a good spread. The hotel is getting a garden shortly with its own Sakura, waterfall and other flora. Rooms on higher floors have a lovely new of tokyo tower and mt Fuji if its a clear day. Also has a shuttle going into Narita although we used the hotel from Haneda airport to get here which was great too. The minivan was clean, with a friendly driver who kept showing us Sakura along the route.

2,REDACTED,en,4083,"We were very impressed with the quality and service of this luxury hotel. Lovely staff were helpful and attentive to our needs. The small gym is good too, which is unusual in Japan. Whilst a little more expensive than others, it was worth the money and we will return.",5,2013/03/31
2,REDACTED,en,4084,"Conclusion: Excellent Stay. Excellent Property.

This stay: 2 nights. Upgraded to the one bedroom suite on the 9th floor, with seperate living room and bedroom (it's two standard rooms together, but with a kitchen sink, which was useful), which was nice. Of course it's not comparable directly to a new hotel in terms of facilities (small gym, 80s style lobby), but the hotel management should get an A for keeping up the maintenance of this property. Nothing out of place, everything works well, and with a touch of class. I was on personal trip (no business to take care of the eastside this time) and I prefer the westside of Tokyo (Daikanyama, Omotesando, Shibuya, Harajuku, Shinjuku) to walk around and enjoy the weekend anyways, so the location was not an issue, if it wasn't even better, so no issues there. Walking escalator to Ebisu station was convienent but nothing to write home about, I found for westside destinations (Daikanyama, Omotesando, Shibuya, Harajuku, Shinjuku) the taxi fare was reasonable (JPY 800 - 2000)

Pros: Comfortable, reliable, mature and responsive staff & service. Bed and bedding is Westin standard. Skip and hop to the westside Tokyo where it's about lifestyle, rather than business.

Considerations: (i) location is better for westside Tokyo travellers (ii) old style (80s/90s design) compared to the newer properties in Tokyo (Shangri-la, Peninsula, Mandarin Oriental, etc), but as I said, it's has an charm all of its own which I can best describe as classy (which newness or money can't buy) - the other classy hotel I really like is the Imperial Hotel Tokyo.

About me: East asian male, based in Hong Kong, travels for business and pleasure 100-150 nights a year (most Asia), SPG platinum 75",5,2013/03/31
2,REDACTED,en,4085,"Lovely hotel, large rooms by Japanese standards. Expensive though too. We stayed at the club level which included a nice snacks and drink service in the evening and breakfast in the morning. Quiet area of Tokyo, stunning views from the higher floors. We were able to see mt. Fuji. Somewhat long walk from the subway. Otherwise a great hotel and what you would expect in this class.",5,2013/03/31
2,REDACTED,en,4086,"We had a very pleasant stay at the Westin In Shibuya at the end of a long trip in Japan. It is slightly off the beaten track if you want to explore Tokyo primarily on foot. That said, it is well served in terms of public transport. The area surrounding the hotel is nice and you aren't far from the heart of Shibuya which is very lively. 

Throughout our stay we dealt with many of the staff to ask advice on outings, restaurants, locations, extending our stay and more. In every instance the staff went that little bit further to provide what you requested and more. Not only attentive but enterprising and keen for us to really enjoy our stay in Tokyo, not just the hotel.

In comparison to our first few nights in Tokyo at the ANA Intercontinental it was more relaxing due to being away from the hustle and bustle with far superior rooms. It certainly wasn't as convenient for the first time visitor though.

Ps. Don't miss a fabulous Sushi restaurant nearby called Sushi Ouchi. Amazing food and very welcoming atmosphere. A short cab ride from the hotel.",5,2013/03/29
2,REDACTED,en,4087,"I stayed here for 7 consecutive weeks for business. The room was okay, but the bed definitely made a difference, it was very comfy. While the gym was kind of small, they had a deal with this really nice private gym in the area, where you can work out for free, that was great. Ebisu station is just a 10-min walk.",5,2013/03/22
2,REDACTED,en,4088,"Opted to stay here over the Sheraton Meguro which is 2 stops away from Ebisu Station. Stayed Feb 2013 with Wife and Infant - SPG Gold.

We came from the Sheraton Grande Bay (Disneyland) by train and the first thing I would like to warn parents with strollers or luggage + kids - This is a long walk albeit the travelators of Yebisu Skywalk. From the Skywalk please remember to take the under passage at the end of the travelator on the right (Where the information counter is) instead of walking crossing the main road to Westin. This will save you energy and time.

The hotel is like any other Westin nothing much to say here. Was given a room upgrade (corner room) but not on the SPG floor. Even so, the room was clean and spacious - complimentary Wifi for Gold and only 1 bottled water provided per night (if i remember correctly). If you've stayed in a Westin before, you get the same set-up - I just missed the heated toilet seats and butt washer! I am satisfied and have no flaws with hotel, I just want to point out some tips while staying here:

1. There's a grocer at Mitsukoshi on the basement for snacks and drinks
2. ManRyu Ramen near the basement grocer serves good Sapporo Ramen. Expect a queue.
3. Westin is located off the action and a good 20min+ train ride to Tokyo Station.
4. Take the limousine bus back to Narita if you're lugging back more luggage then what when you came. It's 3000Yen per person (if I remember correctly) one way.",4,2013/03/22
2,REDACTED,en,4089,"We tend to stay at 5-star hotels with generous loyalty rewards and for Tokyo, this means either the Park Hyatt or Westin Tokyo. For our latest 2-week family trip the vote was unanimous for the Westin Tokyo. 

We are amazed by reviews that claim that it is out of the way. It sits in a very nice neighborhood very close to the Ebisu train and subway stations, making everything extremely convenient and easy to get to. The same cannot be said for the Park Hyatt which seems to require a taxi to get anywhere. 

We are also surprised by the critical reviews about the styling not being minimalist – seriously? I like comfort when I travel; if I want to sit on a park bench I can go to any one of the many parks throughout Tokyo. The rooms are VERY comfortable and spacious. 

The complimentary Westin Executive Club on the 17th floor is a wonderful place for a solid breakfast before a long day of sightseeing and for evening drinks and hors d'oeuvres before a nice dinner out.

Once again, on this latest trip Mirei Ri was exceptionally helpful in every aspect of our stay to include recommendations for day trips and dining. She represents the epitome of hospitality. Jun Shigeta the reservation manager was always accommodating from helping to adjust our length-of-stay at the last moment while still retaining our early-booking discount, to helping us to secure a wonderful upgraded suite through “Tom” the front desk supervisor. The porters are so gracious and grateful for the smallest tip that it is almost embarrassing. This is the type of personalized service that we just never get so consistently year after year anywhere else across the SPG system or any other hotel chain.

We’ll always come back to this wonderful hotel in Tokyo. There is a reason it is ranked #1 on TripAdvisor!",5,2013/03/18
2,REDACTED,en,4090,"Seriously, there's a reason you're seeing a second review from me here in less than a year. On my way to Subic Bay, I took a rest overnight here for two reasons. First, 14 and 5 hour flight are best broken up with a night between. Second, my alma mater's football team was playing for the National Championship, so I wanted a quiet place to watch the game in peace.

It met all my requirements for that activity. The room was very comfortable, just like last time. The night before, I picked up some snacks and some single malt whiskey for during the game. The hotel subscribed to a channel that played the game (with English audio), so I was able to watch it without any kind of interruption. By the way, we won.

The point to take away from my review is that, even as I spent a lot of time in the room, it was still a very comfortable place. The next time I'm in Tokyo, I'll be here again.",5,2013/03/17

Overall a wonderful stay and wish we could have stayed longer.",5,2013/03/14
2,REDACTED,en,4092,"Recently stayed for four nights. This was my second stay at this property, and both stays were wonderful. 

The staff was friendly and helpful throughout the stay. The room was comfortable and well-equipped. The property was in great condition. The location was convenient to the Ebisu station (mostly indoors walk - but about a 5-10 minute walk depending on your speed - much of that is accelerated by moving walkways). (If coming from Narita, you can get a combination Narita Express and Suica ticket, use that to get to Shibuya and then transfer for 1 stop on the Yamanote line to Ebisu. Much faster than the bus, and you get a Suica card that can be used on the transit system while you are in Tokyo)

Stayed with club access which was nice for snacks and breakfast, as well as a good place to visit with colleagues. 

I enjoyed the breakfast buffet, which had a large selection of western and Japanese items. We occasionally lingered over breakfast for some time, and the staff did not mind. 

We transferred to the Hyatt Regency midway through this trip, and I must say I regret leaving the Westin. Bell staff was very helpful in arranging transfer of our luggage to the Hyatt during the trip.

I hope to return to The Westin Tokyo in the future. Truly an elegant and comfortable place to stay.",5,2013/03/11
2,REDACTED,en,4093,"I hadn't previously stayed in Ebisu, but I will in the future. It's an upscale neighborhood, interesting to walk around and with some good eating choices. A short walk to the train and subway stations. If you want to walk a little further, it's not far to Daikayama with its fancy boutiques and restaurants.

The Westin proved to be a good choice. Definitely an older style hotel, with lots of marble, ornately patterened carpets, gilded mirrors. My room on the 13th floor was spacious, clean and comfortable. Good bathroom - tub and separate shower. Minor complaint - the room safe is not large enough to store a laptop. Quite a good gym on the 4th floor.

Plenty of restaurant choices in the hotel (Japanese, Chinese etc.). The only one I tried was the breakfast buffet place just off the lobby. Good choice of Asian and Western dishes, but very expensive (approx $45 for breakfast buffet).",4,2013/03/02
2,REDACTED,en,4094,"Good location for Ebisu & Shinigawa......5 mins walk to Ebisu station & a 10 min cab ride to Shibuya Station for the Narita Express.
Dont be put off by the slightly dated interior - its a Westin with a twist - incrediblly well maintained & clean hotel with VERY large rooms for Japan. Rooms facing west had a stunning view of Mount Fuji. Allot of great eating options across the road & a Mitsukoshi Department Store.
One area for improvement would be the food - its ok but not as good as the Westin in Kuala Lumpur which is fantastic.",4,2013/03/01
2,REDACTED,en,4095,"Very disappointed with my stay. 
1) Poor service. I had to carry my own suit cases when I was checking in and checking out. The bell staff just did not care, especially the female staff named Hayashi at the check-out counter. She was rude and when I asked her for someone to help with luggage, she just pointed to the door and asked me to go there myself. Another female staff on the phone gave me someone else's message but turned around to accuse me of not providing certain information. (Seriously, what information besides self-identification is necessary to retrieve a message if I am calling from the room?) 
Although I did see a couple of staff looking helpful with Japanese-speaking guests so perhaps this hotel targets the locals. I was surprised given Japan's usually-high service standards but this hotel did not even meet international standards when it comes to dealing with foreign guests. 

2) Poor location 
It is a far walk from the nearest train station. Even though the walkway is covered, it is a wind tunnel and extremely cold at night. Worse, hotel was not prompt in getting taxis on standby. For two consecutive weekday mornings during work hours (between 8-9am), I had to wait for about 15-20minutes in the cold with no cab. I have stayed at and visited various locations in Tokyo and never waited for more than 5 minutes for taxi. In most hotels in Tokyo, the staff would go out to the main road to get the taxis to come in but I did not see that at the Westin. 

Despite the room being very spacious and kept rather clean, the above mentioned points would be more than enough to turn me away from this hotel for a long time to come.",2,2013/03/01
2,REDACTED,en,4096,"As a family we only had a couple of nights before going on to the snow and The Westin made it a great stay. Through their concierge we organised a tour guide and restaurant for lunch. 'Haroumi' was our guide and she really made our stay in Tokyo. She filled us in on so much history, culture and local knowledge that we would never have had access to. The hotel recommended and booked a Teppanyaki restaurant for lunch which was a fantastic experience with Haroumi translating for our chef as he told us all about the dishes he was preparing. Our children, 20 and 18 and my husband and I rated it one of the best meals we've ever had.
The hotel is styled classically, with close to American size bathrooms (this is important in Japan!).
Breakfast buffet was very nice.",5,2013/02/28
2,REDACTED,en,4097,"First of all, you cannot compare the value of a hotel in Tokyo with one in China. Tokyo's land value and wages are highest in Japan, and Asia.

I spent 2 nights in the hotel. The staff were very helpful before I arrived. E-mail correspondence was attended quickly with fluent English. Check-in was very efficient. The staff even gave me a feel as if I was in Europe.

The parking facility was just great. I reserved a parking space during my stay. The auto gate recognized my car's license plate and it let me out and in automatically without inserting a ticket. 

The room was VERY spacious, even in the context of China & USA, not to mention Tokyo, which relaxed me a lot. The decoration was in classic European style. It's warmly-coloured everywhere so it is not like other brands like Le Meridien which gives you cyber feel. 

I tried a bar in the 20-something floor. Tokyo Tower is in your eyes over there. The price is tally with a 5-star hotel but IMO it is worth trying. 

Surrounding area is quiet since Ebisu is not a place for entertainment. But going to and from Ebisu JR station is convenient by skywalk, the escalator network. So you don't have to walk uphill from the station to the hotel. 

It's definitely a value choice if you want to stay luxuriously in Tokyo.",5,2013/02/26
2,REDACTED,en,4098,"We were able to extend our visit to Tokyo and spent the extra night at the Westin. We arrived around noon time and were able to check in right away. The room was clean, comfortable, and quite spacious. The location was a bit of a walk from the metro but it was quite a nice area. The highlight was the staff who were all very friendly... We had an issue with the AC and two gentleman fixed it right away and were also very friendly. When we booked the rates were quite reasonable compared to other comparable hotels and we were delighted to have stayed there.",5,2013/02/25
2,REDACTED,en,4099,"Stayed one night here. Very comfortable, but very expensive. The location is quite out of the way, but being in Meguro let me walk to the very famous tonkatsu restaurant Tonki.

The room was quite nice, but the styling was very old-fashioned and not really to my liking. Trying too hard to be European rather than the more minimalist Japanese style.

Overall, I was satisfied, but not sure I'd necessarily stay here again.",4,2013/02/17
2,REDACTED,en,4100,"The Tokyo Westin is a high quality hotel offering great views over the city. Unfortunately, it is a little far from the 'action' being situated within a very pleasant shopping/dining complex in Ebisu. It is well connected by public transport but just not very central. Staff were helpful and friendly. We were a little dissappointed that we were asked to pay a cover charge for the bar at the top of the hotel. I can understand this for non guests but thought it was a bit over the top when we were paying to stay there. Would stay there again. Oh, one gripe (which actually applies to every bar in Japan) they cant make a cocktail!",4,2013/02/16
2,REDACTED,en,4101,"I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. The hotel is close to the train station but a 30 minute taxi ride to Shinjuku. Although the hotel is far removed from Tokyo, there are plenty of places to eat and shop within a close walk. The beer museum across the street is a neat visit and it is free! 
The hotel itself is dated, but clean. Housekeeping was punctual and did a nice job with the room. The restaurants within the hotel are not very good at all, and should be avoided, as well as the breakfast buffet. There is a sushi restaurant that is over priced (even by Tokyo standards) and the fish was not fresh at all. The Chinese restaurant is also very expensive and the food quality did not match the price paid. A 10 minute walk from the hotel will solve those issues. There is an extra charge is you want to use the swimming pool and internet.
The staff is OK at the hotel, and lack the traditional Japanese customer service. I am returning to Tokyo in two weeks, but will not be returning to the Westin.",3,2013/02/11
2,REDACTED,en,4102,"This was our second stay at the Westin Tokyo. We returned to this hotel during our three-week holiday visit to Tokyo 12/25 - 1/9 because of the super location, many boutiques and stores within walking distance, tens of restaurants and transportation convenience. As the other reviewers have stated, the Ebisu Train Station is across the way from the Yebisu Garden Place (10 minute walk) with several main JR lines running out of there. You can even get to the Train Station from the underground walkway connecting from the Westin. It is so convenient if it is raining or cold out which it was when we were there. There are so many restaurants (different price levels and cuisines) within the Yebisu Garden Place and the surrounding area. Within the Place, there are many shops, a theater, and also one of the locations of Japan's oldest department store, Mitsukoshi. The Place has many office buildings including the headquarters for Sapporo Beer, one of Japan's premium beer companies as well as the Sapporo Beer Station and the Sapporo Beer Museum. The Yebisu Garden Place property was an old brewery years ago. The Hotel itself is like any other Westin Hotel, except the customer service and attentiveness of the staff are outstanding. They also treat their Starwood Points customers with even more care. The front desk staff already knows when you arrive if you are Starwood Member. It's great! You feel really special as soon as you check in! The front desk staff all speak English very well. When we requested for a late check out on our day of departure, it was no problem and no hassle. We needed to use the Business Center and use their Internet. They usually give out free 15 minute passes, but when we needed an extra 15 minutes, it was not an issue. Also, this Hotel is one of the handful of designated stops for the Limousine Bus to and from Narita Airport. You can buy the Limousine Bus tickets at the front desk or Express Desk in the Lobby. The beds are awesome as they are their branded ""Heavenly Beds"". We took the option of an extra USD 80 a day upgrade for access to the Executive Club Lounge. They served breakfast (both western and Japanese) until 9:30am, then snacks and refreshments (including alcohol) all day and into the evening. The view from the Lounge level was beautiful, especially in the evening. You could see the Tokyo skyline with all the lights including the Tokyo Tower and the Tokyo Skytree. It was well worth it as the food and beverage at the Hotel tends to be on the expensive side. As one of the other reviewers noted, we were also not impressed with their buffet. At one lunch, we order from the a la carte menu and it was even more expensive and not even that great. Although, their bakery and desserts are top notch. If you are going to have something to eat at the Hotel, I recommend having a coffee or tea and dessert/cake. We found them to be delicious. There were a few other downsides to the Hotel such as it was not as new as it was when we stayed the first time. I guess that is normal wear and tear for a hotel such as this. Some examples, although, the bathrooms are beautiful, you can still notice they could use a spruce up. The furniture in the room was fine, but it could use an upgrade or a freshen up. I also noticed that some attention to detail in the cleaning of the upholstery could have been better. There weren't any stains or anything gross, but I noticed that the sides between the sofa cushions could have been vacuumed better and the wood polished. The Fitness Center does not have a pool, you have to go to the fitness center in the Yesibu Garden Place to go for a swim. I know I sound to be demanding, but when you pay upwards of $600-700 a night or more, I expect every detail to be taken care of. But, with that said, we would absolutely stay at the Westin Tokyo again next time. It is an awesome location because everyone in Tokyo knows where it is and my friends and family were able to come visit us with ease.",4,2013/02/10
2,REDACTED,en,4103,"This is a beautifully kept, very comfortable hotel in one of the loveliest neighborhoods in Tokyo. The Ebisu station is about a 10 minute easy walk away through an enclosed route with moving walkways. From there it is an easy subway or train ride to the rest of Tokyo including both business and tourist destinations. Right across the street is a high end shopping mall and just beyond is a neighborhood worth exploring for its many restaurants, bars, and shops.

The rooms in this Westin are generously sized and very thoughtfully furnished with comfortable chairs, a padded stand for luggage, both a shower and a good sized bathtub, and much more. The rooms are supplied with Japanese style sleepwear, hair clips, bath salts, and many other amenities you won't find in Westins in the US. Despite all this, it's possible to get a room here for about $220 depending on the exchange rate.

The hotel also houses several nice restaurants. The Terrace on the first floor serves an excellent all you can eat buffet in addition to menu items.

In short, this hotel offers a perfect combination of both Japanese and American style comfort.",5,2013/02/06
2,REDACTED,en,4104,"I've have stayed here on two occasions in the last 18 months while on business. Would not recommend on personal travel given the location and better options available (Grand Hyatt, Conrad, etc.). Very consistent service and quality at the Westin Tokyo. Rooms are large for Tokyo, clean but showing some signs of age/wear. Service was good, not great, and the large buffet was expensive but good. Nice neighborhood, but pretty quiet if you need ""action"". Good area for running and peacefull strolls. Gym was well equipped and clean. I will return when on business.",4,2013/01/29
2,REDACTED,en,4105,"I stayed in this hotel while on a business trip to Tokyo in July-2012. 

The hotel is on a walking distance from nearing railway station. It also has many Indian restaurant in vicinity.

The rooms are very spacious (unlike most other hotels in Tokyo) and staff is very friendly.

just opposite the hotel there is big shopping complex.",5,2013/01/26
2,REDACTED,en,4106,"We have stayed here several times and have always been satisfied with the consistent high quality of the accommodations and service. It is conveniently located on one of the JR Yamanote stations and Hibiya line, which equates to easy access to almost anywhere in Tokyo. Staff are always professional and accommodating of guest needs. It's a treat to stay here!",5,2013/01/20
2,REDACTED,en,4107,"Stayed here back in November after staying at the Grand Hyatt, Roppongi and the Dai-Ichi. This was my 6 visit to Tokyo in the last 18 months and this was by far the best hotel I stayed in.

Plus points
Service, service, service! Absolutely flawless. I mentioned once during a room service order that I have a gluten intolerance and on each subsequent room service request they remembered un prompted and even checked each meal directly with the chef! This is just one of many little details that the staff at the Westin dealt with during my stay.

Lobby and rooms. Lobby is very impressive (especially after the shabby Dai-Ichi) and the standard rooms are huge and very well furnished. Views are superb too. I had a fantastic view of the Tokyo tower.

Value - Compared to other hotelsin Tokyo, this fine hotel provides incredible value, although prices in the cute little bar are somewhat extreme!

Minus Points
Although Ebisu is a nice area, you are far away from any ""real"" Tokyo excitement and atmosphere

That is about it really. Fantastic hotel in my favourite city. I just wish it was situated in a area with a bit more oomph!",5,2013/01/16
2,REDACTED,en,4108,We have been staying in this hotel everytime we visit Tokyo and it has become a place of comfort as well as extreme comfort. The buffet is one of the best we ever had with all the hotels we have stayed and the staff professional and helpful. And they always place us at our favorite room that has a view of the rainbow bridge as well as the Tokyo Tower.,5,2013/01/15
2,REDACTED,en,4109,"A favourite hotel in a fabulous location. Good English spoken here. Top marks for eco-awareness. If you forego maid service (daily towel/linen change) you receive 500 yen voucher per day which can be spent at the F&B outlets in the hotel or converted to loyalty points. The room will be made up every 3 days anyway and every day the rubbish bins will be emptied and refreshments (tea/coffee, complimentary water) restocked. 

As for the location, Ebisu is one of the coolest places in Tokyo and is right on the most useful subway (Hibiya) and JR/rail (Yamanote) lines. In Yebisu Garden Place you can enjoy the delights of the Yebisu Beer Museum, high-end Joel Robuchon restaurant, Mitsukoshi Dept store (be there at opening time and be greeted by bowing salespersons as you enter!) ad much more. Lots of eating places from the basement to the sky! If the weather is inclement you can still get around undercover ….. and there is a pedestrian travelator to Ebisu JR station which is housed in Atre, another shopping mall. On a clear day .... you can see Mt Fuji!",5,2013/01/07
2,REDACTED,en,4110,"Whilst our overall stay at the Westin, Tokyo has been pleasant, I am annoyed that we have effectively been ripped off by a hugely over priced buffet (at the Terrace), serving substandard food. The cost for an adult is 9900JPY which equates to $108AUD. This, by any standard is outrageous for a buffet! If what was presented at this buffet was 1/2 the price, the hotel would still have made a substantial profit! For the price they did charge, there was no fresh seafood apart from a tired looking seafood salad that looked far from fresh, and very little in the way of vegetables, fresh or otherwise. For example, the salad section had lettuce, onion, sprouts & cold cauliflower!! Not a tomato or cucumber to be seen, and a greater variety of dressings than salad ingredients. I mean really, how hard is it? I could go on, but I'm too annoyed. Yes, we didn't have to eat there, but after a long day's sightseeing, we decided to avoid the chilly night & eat in. What a mistake!",4,2013/01/03

Good to see that the hotel is so strong and well built !
As usual the room is spotlessly clean and well maintained.",4,2012/12/30
2,REDACTED,en,4112,"The Tokyo Westin is by far the best Westin hotel I've stayed at. I had an upper floor room and access to the business lounge. I had a fantastic view of Mt Fuji from my room which was a joy to look at. The room's are a good size and the hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. The ground floor bar served good food - I had the best fish and chips I have ever had, and the top floor bar has great views and they do an excellent vodka martini. I had breakfast every day in the business lounge, which also offered free wifi. My only complaint is that I had to pay for wifi in my room. For the daily room rate, which is very expensive, you'd think they would through in free wifi!",4,2012/12/29
2,REDACTED,en,4113,"I stayed in Tokyo for a month, on a business trip, with my stay split between two hotels as rooms were not available for the entire stretch. I was accompanied by two team mates to the trip. We had three separate rooms and I was accompanied by my wife.

I stayed in Westin from 8th July to 22nd July 2012. The stay in the hotel was not something I would remember fondly. I was driven to write this review because I could compare my stay with Cerulean Tower Tokyo hotel in which I stayed from June 22nd to July 8th, right before I shifted to Westin. 

Decent décor , fancy carpeting, smiling faces of the staff , polite good mornings and acknowledgements, clean rooms is something that we all have come to expect from top end hotels. (After all they are charging you for this). You would find that the same is here as well. But being customer-focused demands something more than these mechanical ( read superficial ) aspects. This is what makes you truly feel like a guest in the hotel and not some client who is merely occupying a room.

Apart from many other small things I would like to call out the following incident that would highlight how Westin failed to grab a chance to really impress.

On day of our checkout we packed our bags early and left the room about 1000 hrs. A female attendant came to our room to collect our luggage. Some of the bags were heavy to we helped her out. With luggage done we completed the formalities at the checkout counter and took a stroll at the departmental stores nearby ( Yebisu Garden ). At 11:30 we boarded the bus to Narita and reached the Airport around 1:30 PM. To our horror we figured out that we have missed one bag in the room :(.

Series of events
1. Called the hotel to confirm that the bag is in the room : for whole 3 hours after the checkout the hotel had still not swept the rooms.
2. We had to call 4-5 times and wait for 20 minutes before some one to actually confirm that the bag was indeed in the room
3. Lady on the phone was very prompt in replying that it would cost us 27000 JPY for the bag to be sent via taxi to airport. Consider this : I stayed in the hotel for a total of 15 days and our bill ( for me and my team) came out to be JPY 1,080,000. The hotel failed to extend their support and absorb 27000 yen (2.5% of the total bill) but instead asked me to pay

I did not ask the hotel to send the bag via taxi fearing that bag may arrive late. I later requested the Hotel to ship the bag to me via EMS service to India which cost me (11000 yen + 1000 yen as handling charge from hotel :) )

Why did I expect the hotel to pay in the first place .. Here is why … during my stay in one of the Taj resorts later this year I forgot my driving license in the room itself ( yes I should be more careful). The hotel returned by license to my home address without ever hinting that they are expecting me to bear the cost for my mistake.

Which type hotel would you chose is anyone's guess

Other comparison I can call out

1. Room service speed ( cerulean clear winner with very very impressive response time)
2. Pool and other facility are available within the hotel premises in Cerulean 
3. View from the cerulean was fantastic ( we stayed in the 32nd floor) 

I have made another visit to Tokyo and insisted my travel desk to not book Westin. I stayed in Cerulean and Anna Intercontinental

Westin is indeed , from the look and the tariff a 5 star but need to be more sensitive to delight factor than just the functional aspect. Even in the functional aspect I think they can try to match other hotels.",2,2012/12/29
2,REDACTED,en,4114,"I stayed in The Westin for a full week for a conference. During the week I made some short visits to different sights in Tokyo: The Imperial Gardens, Ginza (""Fifth Avenue"" of Tokyo), Sensoji Temple, Akihabara electronics shopping, Shibuya for dining and shopping (both Sinjuku and Harajuku). Hotel location is great for this, as it's close to Ebisu train station, which is a crossroads for a couple of subway lines.
Hotel itself is good quality business hotel with nice rooms and good service. Breakfast buffet is wonderful with fruit smoothies and other extras you don't get so often. Consierge made a mistake with a restaurant reservation, but they were extremely apologetic about it afterwards.
Right next door to hotel is a shopping mall, not huge, but very elegant. They have Starbucks, if that is important for you. :-) You can take a limousine bus from Narita airport to hotel and back, which is convenient and inexpensive, but bus schedule needs to match your schedule; they do not run always so frequently.
Over all, I was satisfied with my stay a The Westin. And Tokyo is a lovely place: where else can you find a city of 10-20 million people that is so polite, clean and safe?",4,2012/12/27
2,REDACTED,en,4115,"I started here in late November. The hotel itself is in a good location, not too far from the station. It is located close to many shops and places to eat.

Ebisu the area is named after Yebisu beer and not vice versa). This complex houses a Mitsukoshi department store, the Sapporo Beer museum, several other shops and a selection of cafes and restaurants. Ebisu station on the Yamanote line (the overground loop line around Tokyo) and also on the Hibiya subway line is within walking distance if you find the travelator from YGP. The hotel itself is smart and comfortable though not quite luxurious as you would expect from a Westin and the service is very good, as you would expect in Japan.",4,2012/12/15
2,REDACTED,en,4117,"I have stayed at the Westin twice, both times on business for a few days each. I enjoyed the stay both times. Staff are freindly and all seen to speak English, the hotel has a spacious upmarket feel in all common areas.

Rooms are surprisingly spacious for Tokyo and well equipped including a large Bathroom. All in all I found nothing to dislike about the Westin and would happily recommend it.",5,2012/12/12
2,REDACTED,en,4118,"If you want a hotel in the ""heart"" of activity then this hotel is not for you. While easily accessible on from the Ebisu station (or Meguro for that matter), what I like best about this hotel is that it is in a gentle setting; a breath of fresh air in this vibrant city. I have stayed here 8 or 10 times, most recently in November 2012 and always enjoy my stay. The rooms are immaculately clean (and you can open the window to feel the outside and enjoy fresh air while sleeping. 
The food is very good but there are many excellent restaurants in the local area as well. 
The fitness center is small but meets basic needs. 
As in all Japanese hotels I have been in the staff is very helpful and considerate.

2,REDACTED,en,4120,"I recently stayed at the Westin Tokyo for 5 consecutive nights, and then for 1 more final night before flying out of Narita and I must say I loved everything about the hotel. I considered staying here a couple years ago on a prior trip but was scared away by some friends who told me it's in a boring/quiet area, away from anything touristy and fun. That's not entirely accurate, and the location was one of the things I ended up enjoying the most. Yes, it's outside any bustling tourist areas like Shibuya or Shinjuku, but that's actually a POSITIVE thing in my opinion, and it's so ridiculously easy to get anywhere in Japan via transit that the location shouldn't even garner a second thought.

As others have noted it's at the far end of a plaza/mall which, initially, seemed to me pretty desolate and lackluster. Upon arriving from Shinagawa Station we walked above ground, and by that route you only see a few quiet shops, especially at night. However like most everything in Tokyo there are several sprawling underground levels to the plaza so there really are quite a number of stores, and it's a pleasantly quiet experience compared to the malls and plazas adjoined to most of the major train and subway stations. Note that it's also possible to stay completely inside on the journey from Shinagawa Station to the hotel; just turn right and descend the escalator at the end of the ""skywalk"" instead of crossing the street. That will take you to a lower level of the plaza which has an entrance to the basement level of the hotel - very handy for rainy days. Note also the walk is pretty far whichever route you take - the hotel website says 7 minutes but that's optimistic even for a fast walker like me. It's closer to 10-15 minutes, which isn't a problem for everyone but should be a consideration for anyone who is perhaps older and not as mobile as they'd like to be.

The hotel itself was great, the staff was friendly, rooms were spacious and comfortable, A/C worked well (yes, I'm the type who runs the A/C in winter!), and most notable it's exceptionally quiet. I'm pretty sure the hotel was completely booked most of the nights we stayed and I never heard a single sound from any of the neighboring rooms, nor from traffic in the hall.

I ate at the restaurant only once and it was mediocre (the lobby ""deli restaurant""), and we also had lounge access which was just OK for breakfast, but not outstanding. I booked a room with lounge access because that was the only room available, but despite the relatively few food offerings I probably would book again. It's nice to have a place to chill out at the end of the day to use wifi, have a complimentary few glasses of wine, etc.

Overall I really enjoyed my stay and would absolutely recommend and stay again.",5,2012/11/29
2,REDACTED,en,4121,We stayed at the Westin for five nights and were pleased throughout. Service was friendly and efficient.

breakfast was very good, nice mix of western and asian (extra fee for breakfast).
location is good and Ebisu station is a great travel hub, lots of restaurants close to the station, which is about a 10 min walk from the hotel.

There are quite a few places in Ebisu to eat at and non are far (not more that a 5-15 minute walk). It is close to the JR train station and easy to get to anywhere from here. My convention was at the Tokyo Big Sight and it cost about $40 USD each way to get there on taxi. Perfect hotel, I would use it again.",5,2012/11/08
2,REDACTED,en,4126,"No hotel can be all things to all people. But to score a 5, a hotel should know what it's target is, and should hit it bullseye. The Westin Tokyo does that. 

I'm a frequent visitor to Tokyo, and even that experience does not make Tokyo an easy place for a non-Japanese speaker. There are other nice western-flavored hotels in Tokyo, the Westin certainly isn't the only one (and it is not the lushest of them). 

But here's what the Westin has going for it:

1. Value: The Westin, by Tokyo standards, is a deal. Obviously rates vary, but I've often paid more at comparable hotels for less.

2. Rooms: lovely. Not over the top or modern-slick in any way, but all the right comforts, including multiplug electric. (Don't come expecting stark / clean Japanese design style-- that's not the Westin's style).

3. Here's the big one: EXCELLENT CONCIERGE. When you're a gaijin (foreigner) in Tokyo, you need help finding things and getting around. I can honestly say that in all my travels, I have never encountered a concierge desk that so consistently exceeded my expectations. Example: every restaurant I booked, they prepared a package for me containing Japanese language map and directions (for a taxi driver, if I was to take a taxi), and English language map and directions (for me, using the subway). Sure, most hotels would provide this information if you ASKED for it, but every request I made of the Westin's concierge people was met with similar forethought-- (handing a Tokyo taxi driver English map and directions is about as useful as handing me a Japanese subway map, and they did not want to take chances). It's just a small example, but so emblematic of everything they did for me during the week.

ONE NOTE ABOUT THE POOL: It's not in the hotel, but in an adjacent health club. It's fine for a serious lap swimmer, but it's not very convenient, it's run with a rules-heavy-hand (ie bathing caps, one-way swim lanes, etc. etc. etc.), and it would be a definite downer if you were traveling with kids expecting a cooling dip in the pool. I can't say they are prohibited, but they would surely stretch the limited sense of humor of the pool's overseers.

All in all, this recent visit made me slightly regretful that for many years, I've wandered from five star hotel to five star hotel in Tokyo, liking them all but loving none of them. . . I could just have stayed at the Westin.",5,2012/10/27
2,REDACTED,en,4127,"It was a unique experience during our 4 nights in Tokyo. Elegant, the marbel pieces in the flor the Piano in the Middle is gorgeos and better if you have the chance to hear the lady that plays the Piano.

There are a lot of things to do in Tokyo so we recomend you to go with the Concierge to choose the best option; they arranged for us the ""Nikko Tour"" that was absolutely impresive.

It is close to the Ebisu Station so you can use the subway to go anywhere; we almost visit the most important places in Tokyo using just the subway to save some time otherwise you maght be stuck in the middle of the traffic.",5,2012/10/26
2,REDACTED,en,4128,"Service was tremendously attentive, the view from our room was amazing and the hotel was immaculately clean and nicely decorated.There was plenty of restaurants within walking distance and a main subway stop very close by. The concierge was courteous and was always there to lend a helping hand.",5,2012/10/25
2,REDACTED,en,4129,"I've stayed here a couple times on business and it's always been a great experience. The staff are always unerringly polite and helpful. The rooms are a good size (very large for Tokyo), although perhaps a little old-fashioned furniture-wise. i didn't eat here in the evening (the area has many great small restaurants), but they have a good buffet for breakfast. They don't have a pool actually in the hotel, but, as a SPG member, one can use the good quality one in the spa/gym in the adjoining shopping complex, which you can get to via an underground tunnel, without going outside - absolutely fine in my book.
The hotel is pretty well located, given it's in Ebisu Garden City, a large shopping complex, with a good range of restaurants both high and low end (there's many more good choices within 10 mins) and a large Mitsukoshi department store. Transport is easy enough, being close to Ebisu station, which can take you easily to most places, and only one stop (or a short taxi race) to Shibuya, which also connects to everything. It's easiest access is from Hameda airport (for train change at Shinagawa for Ebisu) , but you can get the train to Narita from Shinagawa. There are also relatively cheap airport buses, but the times didn't happen to work for me.
Yes, this hotel does seem expensive by Western standards, but actually it's pretty reasonable for Tokyo, especially given the size of the rooms. I'll be aiming to stay here again next time I visit.",5,2012/10/16
2,REDACTED,en,4130,The hotel is located in the one of the nicest parts of Tokyo. Very conveniently located near the Ebisu Station (great access to the rest of Tokyo) and across from the Beer Garden and a Mitsukoshi department store. Mitsukoshi has a great food court downstairs. We have two complaints about this hotel. It has a very overpriced international calling rate. A 5 min. phone call to another Asian country cost us $60 U.S. dollars! We stayed at the hotel during the summer at over 100 deg F temp with high humidity. Initially we thought the AC was broken. The hotel apparently regulates its air conditioning to conserve energy. Don't expect to chill out in your room. Ask for a fan! Will likely stay at this hotel again (we are SPG members) but definitely will not stay here during the summer months.,4,2012/10/15
2,REDACTED,en,4131,I stayed in Tokyo for the IMF/WBG annual meetings and chose the Westin given its a Starwood hotel even if the location is a bit off. The neighborhood is not unpleasant and there is a mall close by but this is not very central. The decor is really not to my taste (fake classical ) but the rooms are large and very comfortable. Service was good and I had a pleasant stay. Price was very high but this was a busy week for the hospitality industry.,4,2012/10/15
2,REDACTED,en,4132,"We had a very comfortable 3-night stay in an executive corner room at the Westin. The room and the bathroom were large for Tokyo; the room had a small sitting area with a sofa and plenty of space for luggage. The decor was pleasing albeit somewhat staid. What impressed me the most was housekeeping's attention to detail. For the duration of our stay they never once let the tissue box or bathroom tissue roll run below half full so there was no risk we would ever be out. I know this might sound like a minor, silly detail but I was suitably impressed, though I did wonder and worry if they just threw out those half full rolls and boxes! They also very nicely rearranged things on the bathroom counter to make things more ergonomic for us. All the staff we encountered were exceedingly polite and friendly. We love the hospitality in Japan, which is why we keep returning.

The hotel is about a 10-minute walk from the Ebisu station but the connecting sky walk with the moving walkways makes it an efficient trip. The 2 main train lines at Ebisu Station are the JR Yamanote line and the Hibisu subway line which were sufficient for accessing the rest of Tokyo. If you are jetlagged and craving a full breakfast, the Hibiya line brings you directly to Tsukiji where a delicious sushi breakfast can be had as early as 5 or 6 am in the morning.

Overall a great property and we will definitely return.",5,2012/10/12
2,REDACTED,en,4133,"This hotel was beautiful, clean and very spacious! We loved our stay here. The service was amazing and the hotel was beautiful! Come with plenty of extra cash though cause a burger at lunch alone was $40, a cup of tea, $17!",5,2012/10/11
2,REDACTED,en,4134,The hotel is really nice and very posh. The location is 8 minutes from Ennius station but nothing really else to do in that area. The rooms were nice and clean but don't take the suit !! It is big but so outdated it's unbelievable! They have a fax machine and a type cassette! In the suit!! No iPad or iPhone docking station or anything I'm used to in suits!give it a pass and take a normal room!,5,2012/10/06

- Large rooms (especially for Tokyo)
- Reasonable rates (again, relative)
- Decent breakfast spread (avoid the pricey Champagne)

Cons:
- Small, crowded gym (but at least it's free, unlike the Sheraton)
- 10-minute walk from Ebisu JR/subway
- Often a wait for a table at breakfast
- Very, very expensive laundry service",5,2012/10/06
2,REDACTED,en,4136,"The Westin in Tokyo is a western haven in the eastern cosmopolis that is Tokyo. A true 5 star hotel, with world class services. The hotel is in Ebisu, a trending residential neighborhood, and is adjacent to Yebisu Gardens, an urban mall-development with shopping, restaurants and Starbucks. It is about 12 minutes to walk to Ebisu train station, which is your JR Rail and Tokyo Metro access point to the rest of the city. My only minor nit pick is that the air conditioning in the rooms struggles to keep up with the sub-tropical humidity of late summer, but I find that to be common across Japan.",5,2012/09/24
2,REDACTED,en,4137,"Although it is expected that room rates in Tokyo are higher then elsewhere around the globe, for the rate paid I would have expected a more elegant room, with impeccable service and more than average amenities. The room was standard Westin but most annoying was the hotel putting profit first by charging a fee for wifi service of $20 PER DEVICE. With an iPhone, iPad, and laptop $60 a day is ridiculous! Morning of checkout tried to contact the front desk for 30 minutes without any answer. Even called room service, the business center and as a last resort the ""emergency"" emergency number with no answer! When I finally got through to the front desk, was told they had seen my call but were to busy with other calls to pickup. Good thing there was no emergency! Pretty shocking that in a hotel of this size that says it provides superior service lacks enough staff to perform the basic service of answering the phone. With the many other excellent hotel choices in Tokyo, this will be the last stay at this Westin for myself and my business associates.",4,2012/09/21
2,REDACTED,en,4138,"I have been to Tokyo on business a couple time and always look forward to staying at this Westin. The service is incredible, food is delicious, and the rooms are deluxe to say the least. 

The breakfast buffet is a highlight - fresh fruit, omelettes made to order, and many other selections (Eastern and Western food).

Great location - about 5 minute walk from train station, and 15 minute taxi ride to Shibuya-ku.

Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2012/09/21
2,REDACTED,en,4139,"First extended visit to Tokyo and I picked Westin to get SPG points. It's a very good hotel...service was excellent, concierge very helpful getting reservations to busy restaurants. The staff knew my name after first day. I stayed on executive floor and didn't have city-facing room (a must) for first two days but was moved to city view room for last three days, which was much better. Executive floor about $50 more a day but has good breakfast and excellent evening appetizers/drinks. I rented a bicycle from the hotel each morning to ride through a nearby park (Yoyogi) and door staff carefully explained safest route to avoid car traffic and educate me about bike etiquette in Japan.

Location is not great....five subway stops from Ginza and Harajuku, and about two hours from Narita on the airport bus, which is slow but a greatt deal at 3,000 yen (about $38). Across from hotel is the Mitsukoshi Center, which has the BEST gourmet food court in its basement. Center also has a Starbuck's (although never got wifi to work there, unlike US or Europe, where it connects automatically when you are nearby) and Photography Museum, which was terrific. JR (Japan Railway) and other subway stops are at least 10 minutes away and system is confusing at first, but people were very helpful. I bought a day pass each day for about $10 which was definitely worth it. 

I saw almost everything I wanted to see in Tokyo in five days, but daytrips to Mt Fuji were booked and require a 12 hour commitment, much of it on bus and in traffic, so I missed that. Also, late August/early September was humid and often rainy...I will go back at a different time of the year. The parks in Tokyo are beautiful...Ueno especially, but also Imperial Gardens, Yoyogi, Rikugien, and others. Small graveyards near temples dot the city and the juxtaposition of the graves with the skyscrapers surrounding them is fascinating.

All in all, a great trip and very positive experience at the hotel...if only it were located more centrally!

2,REDACTED,en,4140,"The hotel caters well for business travelers and very easy to reach using the Airport Express Limousine Bus service (around $50AUD) one way vs a $350 private car). The hotel rooms are of good quality with marble bathrooms (a little dated but well maintained). The toilet was the most interesting with a choice of a heated seat, music and different flushing / water options! Very Japan. The club lounge was great for breakfast and offers free wi-fi and also drinks after 5.00pm. The hotel is adjoined to the train station and also a big shopping centre with plenty of dining options. Service was very good, check in/out smooth and staff prompt with good english.",4,2012/09/16
2,REDACTED,en,4141,"Nice amenities, club level is nice but breakfast and happy hour food is pathetic. Gym is tiny. Lovely entrance and lobby. Classical music in afternoon. Staff is very good and service oriented. English is no problem. Location is great.",4,2012/09/06
2,REDACTED,en,4142,"This past August, my wife, baby and I landed at Narita Airport and took the Japanese Limobus to the Westin (took about 2 hrs with traffic but very comfortable seating). Check in was smooth and the lobby impressed us a lot. However, the front desk wasn't able to upgrade us to a club room (I am an SPG Gold), though for the discounted rate I was paying (22,125 JPY/night = $280 USD/night refundable rate booked 2 months in advance), I'm sure they weren't really trying all that hard to upgrade me. I did have a 9 month old baby with me and they were kind enough to have a baby crib already in my room along with a ""Westin Kids"" goody bag (toys, electrical outlet covers, etc.

Room - Beautiful King bedroom on the 17th floor overlooking the city. The room was very quiet and given the business-oriented clients, it was a relaxing environment. They have us the Green Option to get 500 SPG points / night if we skipped housekeeping, so we took that offer for 1 night and had housekeeping come the following night.

Gold Amenity - I got the 250 SPG points and took the free internet option (saving myself about $20/day). You just sign on as if you're paying for it, but they will not charge you on the bill.

Concierge - We had a few requests and they came up a bit short. First, we asked them if the sushi restaurant Daiwa in the fish market took credit cards and she initially told us yes. But when I asked if she were sure, she then took time to actually check and found out they did not. Additionally, I inquired if they could help arrange a sumo wrestling practice (given that sumo is only immediately available during the tournaments), but they told us it was not available. I'm still not sure that's correct as I've read several accounts of people being able to go to see the unadvertised training / practice sessions.

Location - as people have said before, it's a bit of a walk to the metro stations. If you want the JR line (connecting to Shibuya, Harajuku, Shinjuku), then it's about 10 minute walk from the hotel (including 5 minutes inside the station). If you want the Tokyo Metro Hibya line (connecting Roppongi, Ginza), then it's an additional 5 minutes through the station to the other side where you encounter all the restaurants in downtown Ebisu.

Metro notes: For those that don't know, there's 2 separate metro lines (run by different companies). You can use 1 single metro card (which includes a 500 JPY card deposit) that card works on both the JR Lines as well as the Tokyo Metro lines as well as buses and convenience stores. You swipe when you enter, then swipe when you exit and it charges the card based on the distance you traveled. 

Hotel food - we didn't eat at the hotel, instead electing to eat in Ebisu (great fatty ramen place about 3 minutes past the subway station). However, the breakfast buffet was pretty highly recommended though I hate paying $30-40 USD/person for eggs and pancakes.

Check out - went very smooth. We purchased the Limosine bus tickets from the hotel and they just included it on the bill. Note: for the hotel room, they add another ~15% for service charges and consumption taxes.",5,2012/09/05
2,REDACTED,en,4143,"We booked this hotel for business, as the hotel is close to the office I will be working at. We arrived on 8/28 and stayed in room 1503. Due to the poor treatment, we will be cutting our reservation short and will be checking into a new hotel who treats their international guest with the respect. We are also SPG members, but that didn't seem to matter to them.

To start, when we arrived the Bellmen ignored us. Keep in mind, we were a late arrival (we informed the hotel weeks before our arrival), but NO other guest were in site. The bellman just looked down at is desk and blatantly ignored us. Tired after the long flight, we grabbed our 6 bags of luggage and proceeded to carry them in ourselves. We checked into the hotel, and again the front desk clerk never offered to help with our bags. When we got to the 15th floor, it smelled something horrible.... almost like they just spayed for bugs. Turn down service wasn't done and lights were off, making us search in the dark for a light switch. After the lights were on we noticed several carpet stains and one of the curtains were broke with the handle just laying on the floor. 

Second major issue i have is the internet service. They charge $25 dollars per day PER DEVICE! Between my wife and I, we have 3 devices that we need internet service for business.... that $75 extra per day!

TV here is not nearly as good as most hotels in its class. They only have a few English channels, no movie channels, and the TV quality is of one I would expect at a best western. Also, how the room is setup, you cant view the TV from the bed or the couch; it faces the window..... Why in the world would you setup a room like this?

Concierge wasn't particularly helpful. I have a free day that i wanted to look at a tour of Tokyo or go to Mt Fuji. When i inquired about this, the concierge simply pointed to one brochure on her desk, then proceeded to look down at her desk as if that was all the help she was going to give. I looked over the brochure, but wanted to inquire about other things to do around the hotel area. We were told that they were busy and would call us back in our rooms

The next day, I was walking around the hotel and noticed they had a cigar bar. As a cigar aficionado who only gets to smoke cubano cigars when on international trips, i was excited to say the least. After lighting my cigar, the attendant came over and quickly shoo'd us out, asking us to go to the bar area. Not sure what we did wrong, we quietly left and headed to the bar area she asked us to go to. When arriving at the bar area, the waitress told us we were not allowed in due to ""dress code"". I am wearing Nautica short khakis, a Nautica button down shirt, clean shoes and properly groomed. My wife was wearing a skirt, blouse and high heels. After being asked to leave the cigar bar and the regular bar, we ended up going outside feeling insulted. There were 4 other gentlemen in the cigar bar, and plenty of other people in the bar that were far less dressed than us. We couldn't help feeling insulted, as none of the Japanese patrons were treated this way. 

We were always very courteous and respectful. We did nothing to warrant this type of treatment! We hadn't had time to say a word in the cigar bar before being shoo'd away, and never allowed in the normal bar. I cant understand why we were treated this way, other than we are American. We have traveled all over the world, staying at all types of 3-5 star hotels. We have NEVER been treated this way! 

After having enough, my wife politely asked to speak with the hotel manager. She respectfully explained all the issues, and informed him that we felt severely insulted. The manager was apologetic and offered free breakfast in their restaurant; but we felt we would receive the same treatment that we had already experienced in the other areas of the hotel. 

There are some nice things about the Hotel. The beds are very comfortable, the view was good, bathroom was nice, lobby was beautiful, and the location was decent for our working area of Tokyo. There is a small shopping area next to it and close to the subway station.

Unfortunately, the positives don't out weigh the poor service and horrible experience we received. I cant in good conscious recommend this hotel to American guest. We will be removing this hotel from our companies ""recommended hotel list"" for our employees, and will not return to this hotel again.",1,2012/08/29
2,REDACTED,en,4144,I stayed with my wife and son for five days. Airport limousine shuttle service available for 3000 yen and for Japan standard it is quite reasonable.

2,REDACTED,en,4145,"Not all Westins are created equal, and many international Westin's are fancier than many of their U.S. counterparts. The Westin Tokyo is no exception, and has the look and feel of a five star hotel. The lobby is impressive, and the rooms are beautifully decorated. As a platinum Starwood, I was upgraded to a junior suite on the concierge floor (floor 18 I think). Their concierge lounge was great for breakfast and evening drinks/appetizers. The hotel concierge was very helpful, and they were great at giving us directions (the bellman even typed our restaurant address into the GPS of the cab driver). It was a snap getting to the hotel and back to Narita via the Friendly Limousine Bus, although its too bad that the Westin is the last stop of the five or so hotels serviced on that route. The hotel was also conveniently located near the Ebisu train station (a five minute walk). I would definitely stay at this hotel again when in Tokyo.",5,2012/08/12

Approx 20min by taxi from Ginza or the Fishmarket. and 10min from the night life area. 

if you can, book an executive room , this gives you access to the executive lounge on the 17th floor. I have seen and used many such lounges in dozens of other hotels, but this one really deserves the name EXECUTIVE lounge. fantastic breakfast (free), drinks all day, and very friendly and helpful staff. they booked all my restaurant reservations and transfers.",4,2012/07/11
2,REDACTED,en,4152,"The Westin Tokyo is just a 10 minute walk to the Ebisu train station. Yes it's a bit of a journey, but it's on the skywalk which is covered and there are people movers to help speed things up.

Room- we were on the club level so we had a sparkling huge room with an amazing view of the Tokyo tower. Bathrooms were good- we got a kick out of the toilet/bidet. I like that it makes swishing sounds when you first sit down. Very nice when you have to share a room... The Japanese never disappoint- beds were comfy and the room was very clean.

Location- in a business/residential area. It's not loud or filled with tourists walking around. There are some restaurants nearby. If you want nightlife interaction, walk down to the Ebisu station where there are some bars and restaurants that stay open late (we found places open at 1am on a Tuesday night). Shibuya is the next station over or you can take a taxi (about $20 USD w/traffic). If you can, utilize the trains- it's easy and efficient but only run until about 12:30am. Just learn the difference between the JR line and Tokyo metro.
Since we were out late the trains were closed then the skywalk was too...we had to walk on the street back to the hotel. Not a problem for 2 girls- we felt totally safe by ourselves. 
The hotel is connected to an indoor mall so it is very convenient. One of my fave places was the little market (like Family Mart, can't remember the name) for snacks. I loved the hand rolls and they were less the $2 USD each. Perfect to grab on the way to the train station.

Staff- was friendly. Concierge is very helpful with directions. There is a map for anything you need with door to door instructions.

Wifi- we just used the free wifi in the lobby. Connection was good. 

Getting there--From Narita Airport- take the train/Narita Express. It's a little intimidating but easy to do! It's about $35 1 way- if you can buy the JR Rail Pass. You must buy this before entering the country (totally worth it!). It's about a 1 1/2 hour ride total. If you are paying by credit card (AMEX) you need to go to the window to pay- I could not use the machine.
Get off on Shibuya and then go to the Yamanote Line (green). The trains are frequent so it's about a 5 minute wait. Ride to Ebisu (it's a short ride--I think it might be 1-2 stops from there). Find signs to the skywalk. You'll walk for about 10 minutes. There will be many signs for the Westin and Yebisu Garden Place. If you get lost then go to the information desk at the train station for directions! Don't wing it...a lot of the staff do speak English and will help you. 

Cost- we had a deal through a family member that works for Starwood. I saw that our room was about $375 USD. For the amount of space and amenities I feel that this is a fair cost to stay at the Westin. I stayed 1 night in Shibuya at a budget motel for $150 (through expedia, regular cost was $220/night) and it was a closet. Our room in westin fit 3 people comfortably. I would come back again.",5,2012/07/07
2,REDACTED,en,4153,"I stayed at the Westin for the last leg of my honeymoon. The hotel itself is quite grand. The lobby is very large with crazy high ceilings. I thought that the service was excellent all around and the rooms itself were quite large. I have absolutely no complaints about the hotel. The rooms are clean, the hotel was very well kept and everyone was very helpful. Only bad thing is that the hotel is so far from the metro. Most of the walking is covered. From the hotel, you have to walk through the Ebisu Garden (which is quite lovely actually) and from there, once you enter the station, you have to take maybe 4-5 moving walk ways before you end up at the JR Yamanote line. If you want the Hibisu line, it's even further away. To get to the JR, I would say it took us about 7-10 minutes. Only upside is that the walk is almost entirely covered so if it's raining, it's not too big a deal. Other than that, hotel is awesome.",5,2012/06/27
2,REDACTED,en,4154,"I stay relatively frequently at the Westin Tokyo on business trips, and this is my second review of the hotel - which I'm doing because this time, my wife was able to join me and I wanted to comment more from the perspective of a ""couple"".

In a nutshell, while this is an excellent business hotel, it was an even better place to spend some time with the spouse. First off, we were greeted by name during check in (thank you, Ms. Mirei Ri, for remembering me) and, as SPG members, upgraded to a corner room on a higher floor. Though weather makes it unpredictable, when the sky is blue, you get a great view from any side.

Then, there are the concierges - who are just terrific. Ms. Matsuura, Ms. Numakura, and Ms. Konishi really spent their time and effort on each and every one of our requests, getting us great tables at popular restaurants and making spot-on suggestions for our outings. When my wife told them that she wanted to take a cooking class at the ABC Cooking Studio in Tokyo Midtown, they not only made all the arrangements for her, but went out of their way to get her an apron (actually two - so she could choose, and they ironed them first) to use during the class. And all done with a smile and genuine interest in how we enjoyed whatever they had arranged for us.

One can and should expect a pretty high level of service across the board in Japan, but we really appreciate those little things that, to our mind, help make a stay at the Westin Tokyo a memorable experience.",5,2012/06/22
2,REDACTED,en,4155,"My colleague found out I was going to spend the night in Tokyo, and he implored me to stay here. I have to buy him a beer, because his recommendation was on point. The public areas of the hotel were beautifully furnished, and the service was exemplary.

The room was very comfortable, and although I only had a few hours to spend there, I had a wonderful time. Make no mistake, it's quite expensive. But if you're staying in Tokyo, you can't go wrong staying here.",5,2012/06/20
2,REDACTED,en,4156,"Ok, the Westin is expensive, very expensive. But it is a lovely hotel.

This was my first trip to Tokyo and I stayed at this hotel since it is close to my office. The rooms are of a good size, especially for Tokyo. Although I didn't have the breakfast buffet, the buffet spread was quite wide. 

The staff is very helpful especially the concierge who helped me with directions to the train station and some of the attractions.

The Westin is in the Ebisu suburb which is quite upmarket and very quiet. The Ebisu station is a 10 min walk from the hotel. The hotel is about 30 mins from Haneda airport.
There is a Starbucks right across from the hotel and a couple of restaurants as well. A really nice Korean barbecue restaurants awaits on the top floor of the mall opposite to the hotel.

All in all a great hotel for a business trip, but too expensive for a personal stay!",5,2012/06/10

2,REDACTED,en,4158,Very friendly hotel within easy walking distance to the subway and a host of restaurants nearby. Rooms are large by Japanese standards and decorated in a very western style – there is nothing that really signifies you are in Tokyo in the furnishings. One of my pet hates in hotel rooms is the lack of storage. Our room had a great wardrobe but was seriously lacking with draw space – imagine a safe being located right in the middle of one of 3 drawers making it useless for storage. We had stayed there previously and chose a club room again. I didn’t think the standards was anywhere near as high as previously and I can name a host of other hotels with better club evening cocktail facilities. We chose to eat breakfast from the ground floor buffet – nothing very special. Probably would look at another hotel if we ever travel to Tokyo again.,4,2012/06/04

The place is quiet, so it's ideal for a business lunch. There are surely more upscale restaurant, but if you happen to be in the vicinity, you may want to try this place. You cannot smoke in the restaurant, but at the same floor just outside the room before the cashier are some bar stool where you may puff as you like. Good value for you money.",4,2012/05/31

Ebisu station is literally 5 minutes walk away from the hotel. So no worries if you want to move around Tokyo via train.
The design of the room was a bit tired, and actually the first time i see an 'old fashioned' Westin. What it lacked in interior design, it more than made up with its excellent service. From the door men to the housekeeping maid, these are the people that made my stay memorable.
Great stuffs.",5,2012/05/28
2,REDACTED,en,4161,"We enjoyed our stay at the Westin Tokyo. The rooms are very large by Japanese standards, and feel like a typical Western style hotel. It's easy to get here from the airport as the airport bus will drop you off right in front. You also have easy access to the train station to go around the rest of Tokyo. Overall, I'd recommend this hotel.",4,2012/05/27
2,REDACTED,en,4162,"I expecated more from a Westin. This property is in need of a restoration. The lobby was great. The location was great, but the guest rooms were very dated and worn feeling. I expect the Westin brand to have a crisp, modern, clean feel. This fell short.",3,2012/05/25
2,REDACTED,en,4163,"The rooms were a bit outdated, but appear well maintained. Nice bathroom though. We had a room on a higher floor, which had very nice views over Tokyo, including Tokyo Tower. The concierge was very helpful in helping to plan our days out.

The location is quite good, as you have a shopping mall just across the road, with a number of eating options. Ebisu station is about a 10 min walk from the hotel, and it is just a short subway ride away to many key areas of Tokyo (the JR Yamanote line seemed to provide a direct link to almost everywhere we wanted to go).

If you take the airport limousine bus from Narita, note that this is the last hotel on the bus route (we stopped at about 4 or 5 hotels before reaching the Westin).",4,2012/05/23

2,REDACTED,en,4166,"Just another very average-nothing special-overpriced older Westin in a large city. For a three-night SPG award stay, we were pre-upgraded to probably the best possible non-suite room, the view facing corner room on the floor of the executive lounge. Yes, the rooms are larger than many of the new modern hotels and it seems the hotel has been maintained well though the bathroom definitely had the 1980s/ early 90s decor. The breakfast buffet (way subpar when compared to the Taipei Le Meridien where we stopped next) and executive lounge offerings (way subpar when contrasted with the Seoul Westin Chosun that we came from) were nothing to rave about; with lots of dining options a short walk away, we did not try any other F&B outlets on property. The staffs were accommodating and polite. The SPG Platinum amenity we selected was a novelty item, a mini, USB-plug-in keyboard vacuum.",3,2012/05/09
2,REDACTED,en,4167,"Stayed five days during private trip to Tokyo. Never before been to Tokyo and therefore didn’t know what to expect from location, now I can say that Ebisu and nearby Daikanyama are very cool areas for both shopping and having drinks in the evening. Not so crowded and loud as overrated Roppongi and Ginza but with great restaurants, bars and some serious shopping (specially Daikanyama). 
Now back to the hotel. It is old Europe style of hotel with perfect service and food. I noticed few comments on style of the hotel, many of Westin hotels are more conservative style hotels but this type in addition is very popular in Japan as everything coming from Europe and USA. Rooms are very specious for Japanese standards, clean and for sure not outdated. I have been on 11th, non smoking floor, and room was spotless, really nothing to say negative. I stayed in many modern, new and progressive hotels that needed refurbishment only few years after opening. On top of room price they include a lot of taxes incl 10% service charge which increase overall price (wasn’t aware of that). Concierge Masako was very helpful with very good reco for sushi bar, one of nicest concierge I encountered around world. I was there during golden week and both lobby bar and breakfast were overcrowded, you have to apply for waiting list for lobby bar in the afternoon, obviously very popular, not sure is it always like that or just due to holidays. Traditionally you pay for internet and there is no discount for more days which is only thing I regret, wireless in the lobby is for free though.
Both metro and JR stations are 10 min from the hotel and you can use moving escalators to speed your walking, good thing is that from the hotel you go directly via underground passage to the station, very usefully if it is raining which I experienced.
Yebisu garden place in front of the hotel is nice combination of shopping and some restaurants incl few breakfast options as Westin breakfast if you don’t have it in your rate is more then 30 EUR. 
I used limousine bus from airport to the hotel and it took hour and half to get to the hotel. Found it very convenient as transfer to and from airport. I took return ticket where you get 2 days metro pass (pls note that in Tokyo you have two metro operators, one is private with four lines and this pass is not valid for private one).
Overall very good experience and would stay there again.",5,2012/05/06
2,REDACTED,en,4168,"We had never been to Tokyo before so took a stab at this hotel by using our SPG points for free nights. We knew nothing about the neighborhood so let me start from scratch. If you are staying here, fly into Haneda which is only a 30 minute taxi ride away ($USD 90) but still much easier than getting to the hotel from Narita which is 2 hours + drive away. The hotel is gorgeous, we loved the marble and the columns and it feels very European. The check in staff and the concierge staff were some of the best we encountered on our three week Asian tour. The room was lovely and we had a great view of the Tokyo Tower out of the window. Room service on our final day was fantastic; a young man delivered a club sandwich and fries to my room;, took off his shoes before entering the room, bowed, brought in the food, bowed, went to the door, turned around, bowed again and then put his shoes on and left! The service and courteousness of all the Japanese people we encountered in Tokyo helped us to fall in love with the city. The room had a great shower, and a heated toilet seat with built in bidet which is intimidating at first but once you use it, you will love it! After the primitive holes in the ground we encountered in China, all the toilets in Tokyo were amazing! The hotel is right across the street from a mall with nice restaurants and a Starbucks, great for breakfast as the hotel breakfast is very expensive. The train station is right there and you have access to both the JR and the subway so convenient, and so easy to use. It's close to Rappongi (one stop on the train away) for night life and on the same line as the Ginza district which is great especially at night. The only negative is that the downstairs bar permitted smoking, which meant we did not use it. Highly recommended!",5,2012/04/30
2,REDACTED,en,4169,"I recently stayed at the Westin Tokyo as a solo female guest and loved every minute of it. In total I stayed for 7 nights and after spending each day walking around Tokyo it was always a delight to come 'home' to the Westin. The staff were friendly and helpful and in particular the house-keeping staff serviced my room beautifully. If you are a woman staying at the Westin on your own make a note to ask about the 'women only' floor on level five. It was lovely and quiet and security was never an issue. I often relaxed in the lobby and took advantage of the free wi-fi - the lobby staff always made me feel welcome to lounge around at my own will. The location is excellent, within easy walking distance to Ebisu station. I often went to the fantastic food hall in the Mitsukoshi department store across the road from the hotel - the takeaway salads are the best I have had in a long time. The supermarket is also very well stocked for those familiar items you want to take back to your hotel room. Mitsukoshi itself was a great place to purchase quality gifts to take home. There is also a great wine shop called Wine and Party - worth a visit. I am already missing Tokyo and plan on visiting again - I will certainly be staying at the Westin Tokyo.",5,2012/04/28
2,REDACTED,en,4170,"The hotel is beautiful, and the personnel is top notch. However, I fail to comprehend its price. 

During a recent stay, I stayed at The Westin instead of Sheraton Miyako. Having to visit our subsidiary nearby in tow with my daughter, it was more convenient. 

The hotel has been around for about 20 years, and it shows. They do a good job of keeping it up, but areas such as the guest room bathroom is showing its age. (pink tiles anyone?)

The immediate area is a nice break away from the tight spaces typically found in Tokyo, but the access to Garden Place takes you ten minutes from Ebisu station via moving side walk

Overall, the stay was above average, but I can't recommend it at over $400/night. From now on, I'll be staying at Sheraton, which is only about 1/2 mile away.",3,2012/04/24
2,REDACTED,en,4171,"We stayed at the Westin Tokyo for two nights on a short trip to Tokyo. After staying at the Sheraton on our last trip, which we found to be merely adequate with a poor location, we decided we would give the Westin a try. Although we found the Westin expensive at 26,000 yen, it was still cheaper than the Hilton Tokyo. 

As a SPG Platinum member, we were upgraded to the executive floor (unfortunately no suites were available) and provided access to the executive lounge. Our room was larger than expected and featured a superb view of the city. The accommodations were pleasant, bed was comfortable and housekeeping staff did a wonderful job.

The executive lounge was very good, but not great. The evening drinks and appetizers ran from 5:30 - 7:30 pm and featured wine, beer, and cocktails plus some appetizers. I found the appetizers to be somewhat disappointing considering the fact that I've stayed at other hotels in Japan where the lounge will rotate the food options, but they don't seem to here. The smoked salmon was very good and the soups (I really enjoyed the pumpkin soup) were excellent. They also featured a selection of cheeses, salad, and small plates of shrimp. It was nice that you could serve yourself beer, wine or mixed drinks (some lounges require you to order it from the servers) and although the selections were limited, I never had an issue with them running out of anything. The staff in the lounge was also very friendly and helpful. Finally, the breakfast was also very good featuring delicious fruit (the melon was outstanding) a few hot items, cereal, and a selection of pastries. They have an excellent coffee machine that brews a strong cup of coffee. I must add that the lounge is rather large and I never had a problem finding a seat.

Aside from the lounge we spent a bit of time in the bar downstairs, which is an awesome vintage, 1950's style bar with high ceilings and vintage furniture. Just a lovely space, and one where you can relax in for hours. I also stopped in at their cigar room (yes they do have one!) which features an expansive selection of cigars, almost all cuban, with surprisingly reasonable prices for Tokyo. The staff there was also very friendly and there are a few chairs inside where you can enjoy your cigar and order cocktails if you with.

The only negatives of my experience were at the concierege desk. On several occasions I was told incorrect information and/or steered to a decision that was not the best one to make. First, we wanted to have lunch at Joel Robuchon's restaurant La Table across the street. I did not bring a jacket on the trip, but we knew the restaurant was the casual version, so we asked the concierge if it was formal dress. She stated, ""yes, La Table is a formal French restaurant and you must wear a jacket."" After hearing this we decided against going there. However, just to check we stopped in at the restaurant itself and the hostess said the restaurant was casual and we did not need a jacket. On another occasion, we asked the staff how to get to the Hilton Tokyo using the train. The concierge said that taking the train was not recommended and we would have to take the Yamanote Line and get off at the Shinjuku stop and walk over 20 min though huge crowds to get to the hotel. In stead we ended up taking a 3,000 yen taxi, which we preferred not to do. What she didn't tell us was that you can take the Tokyo Metro Line with one connection that takes you to Nishi-Shinjuku and the station is actually connected to the Hilton! We were very displeased by not being told this information.

I must add that we spoke to a different person a day earlier, who was much more knowledgeable and gave us some great restaurant recommendations in the Ebisu area. We tried both of her rame restaurant recommendations (Kohmen and Ippudo) and both were fantastic. 

In any case, we had a very comfortable stay at the hotel, but we were very displeased by the information received at the concierge desk.",4,2012/04/23
2,REDACTED,en,4172,"The Tokyo Westin, which I have been spending my time at while in Tokyo for over 17 years now, is located in the most quintessential bloc imaginable. The hotel itself is a luxury hotel, very high standards, and my most memorable breakfast there was not the completely adequate breakfast Continental buffet, but the Muesli (Swiss cereal with milk) for room service. The room service came with a white tablecloth and a vase of a beautiful pink flower. But the location. The Tokyo Westin is located in Ebisu Garden, which is essentially a commercial district. There is a Mizuho bank, a big 5-floor department store (Mitsukoshi), a drug store, several top class bakeries, and next to the bank, most recently, is a place that serves 8 kinds of highly eccentric soft serve ice cream, including yuzu and black sesame seed. Ebisu Garden is adjacent to the train station, and you must pass through six or so flat escalator-walkways to get from the train station to the Ebisu Garden. There are many clothes stores, though the prices are not particularly cheap, which is seeming in such a place, including Armani Exchange and others. The service within the hotel is superb, there are maps for the train system, various parts of the city, restaurant guides, et cetera. There is laundry service available. The bathrooms are enormous, and comes with a digital scale. The view is incredible, picturesque Tokyo, even with the illuminated red Tokyo Tower in many rooms. The TV has a music option, with Easy Listening, J-Pop, Classical, and more. And of course you can watch Japanese news. Most highly advised that you check this place out for yourself, Ebisu Garden Place is a thriving gem!",5,2012/04/23
2,REDACTED,en,4173,"This is certainly a very nice hotel. Clean, kept up well, all the amenities. However, it's neo-classical fascade, (green marble, beige granite, and fake columns) cover up the fact that this is a very 80's building. Located in a quiet area, which for Tokyo can be a nice break. Yet, for tourists, there is almost nothing of interest in walking distance, and the train station is a solid 8 minute walk. If you have reason to be in that part of town for business or an event, this is a fine place to stay. If not, look for something else.",4,2012/04/22
2,REDACTED,en,4174,"A 4 night business trip stay was very quiet and peaceful but I was glad i was only in the room from late evening to 9am each day. The lobby is an indication of the 1980's or possibly even 70's style decoration. Very old-fashioned 'opulence'. I nicknamed it the 'vintage hotel'. Rooms are spacious, which is a welcome change in Tokyo, but feel so outdated. The quaint little vanity unit with 3 panel make up mirror and stool was like something from a childhood doll house. 

The bed is super comfy, and the rooms are very quiet. Mine had a view of Tokyo Tower, others have a Mt Fuji view - only useful when the weather is exceptionally clear (about 25% of the time, I'm told).

The location is very convenient. Aside from being across the street from my office, it is right near the train station and just 2 stops from Shibuya, has a good Mitsukoshi food basement for snacks, and a food good restaurants in the neighbourhood. Bamboo Grassy, about 200m away, was fantastic for teppanyaki.

If you find this review helpful, please give it a helpful vote. thanks!",3,2012/04/20
2,REDACTED,en,4175,"The lobby is super fancy in an old school, stayed opulence kind of way. This theme carries on throughout. 

Upon arrival I was not recognized as an SPG member, nor was I offered the customary upgrade. I left the check in feeling that I had been overlooked. I had to ask for my points option and even had to inquire as to the location of the elevators. Given the process took 10+ minutes, you would think I would be well-armed with information at that point. 

The executive level spread is really nice. The bar is stocked with lovely wine, beer and champagne choices from Australia, Chile and Japan. 

The room was a big disappointment. Instead of feeling like I was experiencing the best of Japan, I was staying in a room exactly like I stayed in a few months ago in New Jersey in a run down Westin outside of Princeton. 

I'll go back to Cerulean Towers. For the money, the experience is much more modern, more Japanese and ultimately cooler!",3,2012/04/16
2,REDACTED,en,4176,"A decent area - pretty low key area in Ebisu. Good business hotel, but pricey. Rooms are very spacious and nice amenities and food was outstanding, but there are some better options in Tokyo.",3,2012/04/09
2,REDACTED,en,4177,"I stayed in the Westin Tokyo with a friend who was on a business trip in late March, early April 2012 (caveat: I did not pay the bill). 

The hotel is beautiful and sparkling clean, with very nice towels, sheets, bathrobes (even a traditional Japanese robe option) and great bathroom amenities. The room and bathroom were extremely spacious, with plenty of room for two people to move around, get ready, etc. A coffee maker and kettle are provided in the room.

Every lady I interacted with at the concierge desk was immensely helpful, with restaurant recommendations, directions, maps, tour reservations, and airport bus reservations. All of the other staff were also incredibly professional, friendly, and courteous.

We had room service one night, a Japanese noodle soup and also an onion soup and both were delicious (expensive too, but that's Tokyo).

The location of the Westin Tokyo is good, though not in a buzzy part of Ebisu. You’ll need to walk to the other side of the metro to find a more lively scene. The Westin is very close to both the Ebisu Metro and JR lines though, and there's no shortage of taxis out front at every hour of the day and night (I had to catch one at 4:30 am with no reservation, and it was no problem). There are plenty of restaurants and food options located just across the street. Try the St Germain bakery on the other side of the plaza, they have a delicious green tea muffin stuffed with red bean paste, as well as many other excellent pastry items. The lower floor of the department store which has the typical Japanese department store array of delicious cuisines and also a supermarket with everything you might need. 

This Westin was also one of the quietest hotels I've ever stayed in. I normally travel with ear plugs because sleeping in a new place can be disruptive, but I didn't even have to use them here because it was so tranquil.

I highly recommend a stay here if it is within your budget.",4,2012/04/06
2,REDACTED,en,4178,"I stayed here for three days, for a Westin it was very nice but the hotel is listed as a category 6 and I don't think it is. The people were very nice but the concierge was usually under staffed I seemed to frequently have a communication problem with my request but the worst was the morning breakfast. The food was kept in a warmer tray wrapped in saran wrap and was just warm when placed out. The only good part about the morning breakfast was the fresh squeezed orange juice. I stayed at a W in Hong Kong just before and that is a category 6 hotel, someone from the Westin Tokyo should go to the W in Hong Kong and see how its done. Everything form the service level to the dry cleaning and how it is left in your room. I am a fan of SPG properties but I will do my best to try for someplace better in the future.",4,2012/03/08

2,REDACTED,en,4180,"Seven nights in a fantastic hotel within minutes of a variety of hot spots. What can I say, for me The Westin Tokyo had it all.

Rooms - large, very comfortable and well serviced. The beds, heavenly of course, were absolutely fantastic.

Food - I ate at the hotel several times and the meals were fresh, vibrant and very enjoyable.

Service - impeccable. Maps, assistance, recommendations. It was all there and for me, a virgin to Tokyo, it was greatly appreciated.

Gym - not large, but it worked. Very few free weights, however machines, water, fresh air, a decent viiew and I was able to do what I wanted. The pool is in the neighboring building, I never got over there, not a major inconvenience.

Value - ok its 5star in tokyo, get your wallet out the cash is going to hit the fan. At $20 a coffee you have to be prepared to spend money BUT the place does delivery. And thats important.

Location - Ebisu. I was worried that the area was not close enough to everything. I could not have been more wrong. Shibuya, Shinjuku, Harrajuku, Roppongi - all very close by train and by taxi between 15-30 a trip. However, the shock to my system was this. Ebisu is awesome. There is a tonne of great stuff in there.

Recommendations - Ippudo (Ramen), Buri (Sake), Matsuie (Sushi), Sappora Brewery (Beer), Yebisu Toweer (Views), Bambu Grassy (Tepinyaki). - amazing each and every one.

Best - Hotel nailed it for me. Was modern, service orientated, ultra comfortable

Service is excellent (but then again, even 7 Eleven stores have great service in Japan), the rooms are comfortable and elegant and the lobby and restaurants scream ""luxury.""

It's about a 10 minute walk from the subway station to the hotel - good or bad, depending on your stamina. Be warned that during a heatwave during the Summer or the bitter cold of Winter every minute does add up.

While Tokyo has experienced a boom in high-class hotels in recent years (Mandarin Oriental, Ritz Carlton, The Peninsula, etc.), the Westin is a tad cheaper than the newcomers (still not inexpensive, however, and the strong yen is partly to blame) and is really the only choice if you're looking for top-class lodging in the Ebisu area.",4,2012/02/12
2,REDACTED,en,4184,"I am staying roughly about 6 weeks a year at this propertly. And over the years since 2005 not much has changes.

A generous 462 sqft or 42 sqm, this is a room size you do not find a lot in tokyo. In the mean time due to my regular stays as well as being a platinum spg i get quite often upgrade to a suite. The suite is lovely not too big just the right size and i love the bathroom.

Beside of that i have access to the Westin Executive Club which is spacious and well managed. I struggle still a bit with the food offerings which are in my opinion not much. Breakfast is adequate but nothing out of the ordinary. The restaurants at the Hotel in particular Victors and Yebisu are of high standard but very expensive.",5,2012/02/11

2,REDACTED,en,4186,"This Westin did not disappoint. Excellent rooms, comfy bed, stylish bathrooms with separate shower stall and good size tub. My room had a fantastic view of Mount Fuji. 
Location is ok - 5 min walk from Ebisu station, which is not a major hub - good because it's less confusing for beginners in Japan, but getting to many places requires a connection. It is on the circle JR line though, so it is reasonably convenient. 
Everything inside the hotel is very expensive - the breakfast buffet will run over $36 unless you prepay for the whole week, and bar drinks start from about $15 - but this is typical for Tokyo hotels. 
Very good gym, machines with built in TVs, the weights area is a bit small.

The only disappoinment for me was that the hotel has very old-style design - marble inlay mosaic flowers, golden doorknobs, claw-foot chairs etc. Most Westins I stayed at have been real modern, clean lines and minimalistic - so this was a bit of a letdown for me personally. It does not take away from comfort of the hotel though. Great place to stay overall.",5,2012/01/23

The pastry selection was huge and they were every bit as good as any I have had in France. I would go back for the food alone.

The beds were nice and comfortable. In lieu of robes there was a night time kimono for each guest.

Room service (food and maid service) was outstanding. Breakfast was included with our rooms and it was a wonderful mixture of Japanese, Chinese, European, and American food choices. The concierge was quite helpful and was quite capable with his English speech. The hotel is across the street from an exceptional shopping mall/experience.

The executive floor guests are free to use the executive lounge, which is the BIG plus. We enjoyed afternoon coffee with pretty good sweets. 
If you stay during the weekend, you can eat full buffet-breakfast at the Terrace (Western style buffet) or Mai (Japanese style buffet) on Sundays.

But the rooms, despite being clean, are very dated and do not match the prices any more! Window blinds are old style, the beds are not heavenly any more, the bathrooms and their pink ceramic tiles are so sad, etc etc
On top of that, food and beverages keep insanely increasing every year. 20 euros for a salmon plater consisting of ONE slice of salmon????

On top of this, as a Starwood platinum member, I NEVER got any kind of recognition! Never a room upgrade, never a small extra amenity on arrival, Nothing!
I am staying there at the moment and have another booking for next weekend that I am going to cancel immediately and head to the Peninsula.

Stay away from this hotel, they do not care at all about your business.",2,2011/12/03
2,REDACTED,en,4192,"We spent 6 nights at the Westin a couple of weeks ago. My husband was there for business and I was tagging along. The location is good for getting around to various places. The walk to the Ebisu Metro station is quite some distance (~9 minutes) with the JR being much closer (~5 min). Being on the Yamanote line you can get to pretty much anywhere with ease.

Our room on the executive floor was very spacious albeit a little tired. The place was spotlessly clean as one would come to expect of any top end hotel in Japan. The happy hour at the executive lounge is a great perk for paying a little extra as there is a large selection of spirits/beers/wines and canapes (between 5pm and 7pm from memory). The staff are attentive and very helpful. You can rent a bike for either 2000 yen for 3 hours or 3000 yen for a whole day if you are up to exploring the city on wheels.

There is a Mitsukoshi department store across the road and an underground food court, but other than that, you need to walk and explore a little to get more eating options. The area is not that lively at night, so other than those couple of minor things, this was a pretty good stay.",4,2011/12/01
2,REDACTED,en,4193,"We were visiting Tokyo on a family trip and this was the perfect location! The hotel staff even allowed us to check in a few hours early which was great considering we had just gotten off 18 hours on a plane. 

They are located in Ebisu Gardens which offers great restaurants and is convienantly located near the JR Line which made getting around a piece of cake. 

We had a room on the 16th floor and a room on the 9th floor (we split our trip up to go to Disneyland) Both rooms were on the corner and were very spacious. The bathroom was clean and very large. We absolutely loved our views which gave us a glimpse of downtown. 

The staff was above and beyond. Even though they couldn't speak fluent English they always tried to accomodate my requests and if they couldn't they would find someone who could. 

I loved this place and if I could afford a flight back to Tokyo, I would go back in a heartbeat!",5,2011/11/29
2,REDACTED,en,4194,The Westin was decorated for Xmas - and I mean decorated - I counted 10 xmas trees in the foyer alone ! It is well situated close to the train station and subway lines - so easy to get around. A good breakfast buffet included. Room was spacious for japan. Room is very quiet and a good bathroom.,5,2011/11/25

Staff is very nice and understanding; they take care of your comfort.",5,2011/11/24
2,REDACTED,en,4196,"An excellent hotel all round and especially for the business traveller.

The staff were very helpful and a good command of English - nothing was too much trouble. 

The food from the in room dining was very high quality although the breakfast at the Executive Lounge was very poor with regards level of choice and qaulity - something for the hotel to definately review.",4,2011/11/24
2,REDACTED,en,4197,"This is a great hotel from which to visit all of the sights in Tokyo. It is a short walk to both the subway and the train stations. The rooms are large and spacious and in fact, one of the two rooms we reserved was upgraded to a nice suite. 

If you look at some of the reviews here you will see that the management responds to postings and advises folks to contact them for special arrangements prior to visiting - and that is exactly what I did. I corresponded via email with Mirei well in advance and received the highest quality service - she arranged every little detail for us.

One word of warning – Japan is short on electricity thanks to the nuclear power plants being shut down. Tokyo is very hot and humid and there is limited air conditioning outside of your hotel room, so go during the cooler seasons. We went during the first week of September and it was still like living in a swamp.",5,2011/11/13
2,REDACTED,en,4198,"There are already over 300 reviews here, so I'll try to highlight some of the points not often mentioned by others.

The GOOD:
- This is a very clean, modern, and well decorated Westin property
- The room is very spacious by Tokyo standards
- Convenient access to the JR Train stop (Ebisu) via covered walkways (10 min walk). This means it is entirely possible to arrive here from Narita airport without stepping outdoors (Narita Express to Shinagawa, transfer to JR to Ebisu station, then walk to hotel)
- Fast elevators
- Quiet rooms (i.e., good sound insulation)

One thing to be aware of is this hotel does not make you feel like you're in Japan. There's little to the decor that is Japanese. Even the toilets do not have the spray/bidet feature. If you're looking for a Japanese-style property, you'll be disappointed. If that's not important to you, this is a fine hotel to stay in while you visit Tokyo.",5,2011/11/08
2,REDACTED,en,4199,"I stayed at the Westin Tokyo for a week in August 2011. The hotel was very well done and was very spacious. The rooms looked nice with well done furnishings with spacious closet and bathrooms. 

The best thing for a non japanese speaking person is the fact that most of the hotel staff was conversant in English and could help you with directions and places to visit etc. I found it a bit tough to talk to the receptionist at my previous hotel.. so this was a life saver for me.. 

Also, they were considerate enough to customize dishes to make it palatable to a vegetarian. 

The gym and other facilities inside the property were also first class.
The one small dampener was the fact that the in-hotel kitchen shut down by midnight because of the power saving initiatives done by the Japanese government post the nuclear meltdown.. hence if you end up working late in office, it is best to get some grub from outside before coming back to the hotel... I survived on green salad for a couple of days we worked late.

I would definitely come back and stay at Westin, the next time i am in Tokyo! ..",5,2011/11/06
2,REDACTED,en,4200,"I've stayed at this hotel many times. Consequently, travel to and from the airport by train or airport coach is easy, as is negotiating the subway system once in the hotel. The ambience is sedate and the rooms are well appointed. I have always had a room with access to the Club Lounge - a real bonus. 
No question. The hotel is one reason I look forward to travelling to Tokyo",4,2011/11/05
2,REDACTED,en,4201,I stayed at this hotel for just one night. It was very fancy inside and very clean. The room was very nice and the bathroom was very large and clean with a stand up shower and a sitting tub.,5,2011/10/24
2,REDACTED,en,4202,"I came here with my wife for a special occasion and appreciate the gift in the room sent by the GM. This really made our day. Not to mention that the staff was really accommodating. We were having a bit of a bad day since we took the wrong turn off the JR train station and we ended up on the street side. We literally walked 30 minutes around the block with luggage and finally found the hotel. I did not make that mistake again. Everyone here was friendly and spoke English very well. Though I did not receive a suite upgrade for my SPG status, the room was still very large compared to my last hotel stay in Japan. Overall, I would recommend this place and the location is very good if you plan to do some site seeing.",5,2011/10/21
2,REDACTED,en,4203,"I stayed at the Westin Tokyo for three nights at the end of a business trip to Asia. I chose the hotel based on its membership in the Starwood Progam and based on positive reviews.

The room was very nice at this hotel, with all of the amenities that one would expect from a 5-star hotel. I thought the room was a good size, and the bathroom was especially nice, in spite of the fact that Japanese hotel rooms are often very small. The room was very quiet and had a great view of the city.

The service at the hotel was wonderful - every request was fulfilled and the staff exhibited the high degree of professionalism that the Japanese are known for. 

The location of the hotel was very good as well. Initially I was skeptical as the location looked a bit out of the way, but it's across the street from a shopping mall with lots of restaurant and shopping choices, and it's a 5-minute walk from Ebisu station. There, you can easily take the subway or JR Yamanote line to any of the key sights in Tokyo. In general, Tokyo is such a sprawling city that there is no ""perfect"" location, but that said, this location was great for all of the places I wanted to visit (Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ginza, etc.). The airport limousine bus stops at the hotel, but beware that the hotel is the last stop coming from the airport, and the first stop going to the airport, meaning that you'll be riding all over Tokyo for an hour before finally getting on the highway to the airport.

I didn't try any of the restaurants at the Hotel, but I did use the club lounge quite frequently. There was a good selection of drinks, breakfast, and snacks throughout the day.

This is an expensive hotel, but the high quality standards, great service, and excellent location made it worth it for me.",5,2011/10/17
2,REDACTED,en,4204,Stayed here for the last few nights of our honeymoon after a lovely stay at the Park Hyatt. Very nice hotel; we particularly enjoyed the massive Christmas tree in the lobby. We were given a fantastic suite upgrade and club access on arrival. Great location in a very nice suburb of Tokyo with good transport links. We visited the nearby art gallery and shopping area (5 mins walk) and had a couple of meals in one of the abundant nearby restaurants. All in all a great stay and would recommend.,5,2011/10/15
2,REDACTED,en,4205,"After staying at the Grand Hyatt Tokyo, this hotel was a bit of a let-down.

My room was nice, but the general hotel felt old and dated (and the design is rooted in some almost-Chinese flavor of an Asian theme). The bathroom was definitely older than every other hotel I've stayed in within Japan - conspicuously missing was a bidet. Heavenly Bed was standard fare, if a bit firm.

For my work, there was a bit of an issue - my Japanese-sourced Wi-MAX access point didn't work at all in my room, which was odd considering I was right in the middle of a business center within a major city. It could be the hotel design causing interference.

The location is okay - the walk to the train is a bit of a hike (the hotel is about halfway between the Meguro and Ebisu stations). The area is nice, but restaurants are expensive as they are targeted to expats and (Western) business travelers.",4,2011/09/30
2,REDACTED,en,4206,"The staff really goes above and beyond. Even if at first glance the location is not that central, it's an ideal base for exploring Tokyo with NR and metro lines conveniently passing through the train station just a a couple block away. Great for business or vacation, for anyone who would like to see everything but still get a good night's sleep away from the hustle-bustle of Shibuya and Roppongi .... all while being just a quick ride away from their action.",5,2011/09/24
2,REDACTED,en,4207,"Minuses were
- seriously considered leaving after one night but for the fact I was there with a group...would not go here again
- out of the way location, with the Ebisu subway line (itself out of the way from most attractions and main subway lines) a ten minute walk from the hotel...only occasional buses to and from airport, which meant I ended up taking 2.5 hours to get there due to taking airport bus to Roppongi and taxi from there to hotel
- upon checking in, took the desk literally ten minutes to process me with no apparent issues...longest checkin in recent memory ...then got a smoky room despite nonsmoking requested
- hotel restaurant served really poor food and overpriced even for Japan...served very greasy small piece of fish and chips for $40, with lackadaisical service despite the restaurant being empty on a Saturday night

2,REDACTED,en,4208,"We love the Westin in Tokyo! I've stayed here several times in the last ten years- with my family- and we have never been disappointed. The location is superb: Ebisu is a little way out of central Tokyo, but that is a good thing: the area is peaceful, spacious and elegant. Ebisu is on the JR Yamanote line- free for Japan Rail Pass holders- and a great station for getting to just about anywhere. There is a very nice Mitsukoshi department store just by the hotel, with a very good food hall. There's a lovely 'Party and Wine' store for excellent wine and deli, and a French bakery for superb cakes and pastries. At Zoff in the station, you can get spectacles made in less than an hour.
The breakfasts at the Westin are legendary: if you stay in an Executive level room, breakfast is free, with the option of eating in the Executive Club Lounge, or in the restaurant on the first floor. The Lounge is peaceful, but the choice is better in the restaurant. There is so much choice- western, Japanese and Chinese options- a staggering choice of food, and it is all of an excellent quality. 
Executive level rooms are good value, because of the advantages of the Executive Lounge, offering an inclusive breakfast, soft drinks and tea or coffee all day, as well as drinks and food from 5.30, with free internet.
The staff are lovely- very polite and friendly, and the rooms are luxurious and spacious, with excellent bathrooms.
I've tried other hotels in Tokyo, but return again and again to the Westin, because it feels like a home from home",5,2011/09/08
2,REDACTED,en,4209,"Choosing a hotel in Tokyo for my 15 day business trio was very tricky. Service, value, comfort and conveience were all prerequisites and thankfully I found a Westin in Tokyo. I am staying in an executive suite with all of the benefits of the wonderful Yebisu club and executive club. My room is fantastic, clean and very comfortable for my 2 week stay. 

The service and room service has been excellent thus far and most of the staff speak English well enough to easily communicate. The breakfast is easily a $30 breakfast in Tokyo, and is complimentary for the executive club. 

The hotel does get busy on the weekends, but it is never overcrowded. As far as luxury goes, you can't beat this hotel in this price range. I was amazed to find the hotel at such a bargain (I searched their hotel offers on their web page and landed this hotel for leas per night than most 3 star hotels. 

The restaurants are varied, Yebisu, although good was drastically and disappointingly overpriced, probably by double. I'd go to La table by Joel rubechon twice for the same price. Ryutenmon and Victors have lived up to their Michelin ratings (and great value since it is Restaraunt week in Tokyo (for the entire month!). Mai is ok, there is definitely better sushi for less (think Asahi sushi in Ebisu towers across the street). 

Overall, excellent hotel and better value. I just hope I can score the same rate next time I come back. 

The hotel is reasonably close to the JR line and Hibya line. Reasonable for city folks, unreasonable for suburbanites not used to walking.",5,2011/08/22
2,REDACTED,en,4210,"Stayed at the Westin Tokyo a few times, but the negative points such as general attitude, nickel and diming for everything (including coffee in room, fitness centre etc) never stops.

The restaurants are good, but price wise not good value.",2,2011/08/18
2,REDACTED,en,4211,"This is one of the busy hotel we had stayed, probably because of the Christmas season. The hotel locates in a very good location. You could visit Ebisu museum by walking distance. We were there during the Christmas time, and we have to wait 90 mins in line for breakfast, can't you believe it???? My first ever experience to be in line very long for breakfast. Breakfast is lovely and wonderful and worth. Recommend to avoid the season if you plan to stay here.",4,2011/08/14

2,REDACTED,en,4213,"Spent a long weekend in Tokyo for a celebration weekend. Decided to stay at the Westin in Ebisu. 
The property is a 10 minute walk from the nearest metro - easy and pleasant.
The property it self is what you would expect of a Westin. Very friendly staff. very warm and welcoming. I would certainly recommend this property to anyone wanting a comfortable and relaxing environment in a city of majesty. 
Rooms are very well appointed - bathrooms were spacious and nicely finished.
I really must reiterate - The staff in this property are just so warm and friendly - from the moment I arrived - warm friendly smiles, and genuine service.
I will stay with Westin again. Well done!",5,2011/08/05
2,REDACTED,en,4214,"Very good hotel in quiet location in Ebisu. Ebisu station is a pleasant 2 min walk and connect into Tokyo subway system. 

Hotel is comfortable and restaurants serve good food. Hotel bars are little lacking in atmosphere but Yebisu beer station is just across the road and there are many small eateries nearby.",4,2011/07/28
2,REDACTED,en,4215,"I am a frequent visitor to Tokyo on business, and I have been staying at the Westin Hotel in Ebisu every three or four months now for the past two years, most recently this past week. Good service is a given at most hotels in Japan, where competition is brutal and people can expect to be treated well, but the level of gracious service that I have been receiving at the Westin is so outstanding, I feel compelled to write this review to make sure others know of this gem of a hotel.

First, the staff is friendly, warm, helpful and bilingual. They will remember you quickly and help is never more than a question away. In particular, I have used the Concierge Desk very extensively and their 'service with a smile' attitude just shines through. On this trip, I bombarded Ms. Matsuura from the Concierge Desk with multiple restaurant reservation requests, and she always came through with impressive table locations or private rooms. Given that most people in the center of Tokyo eat out often, having a reservation at a popular spot is a necessity. I commend Ms. Matsuura to her management as an exemplary representative of the hotel, and hope that they will recognize her (and her colleagues) for the great job that they do.

Second, the rooms are spacious, clean and lavishly furnished. I sometimes work from my hotel room, and many Japanese hotel rooms can become a bit claustrophobic, which is not an issue at all at the Westin.

Third, the location is, for me, very convenient. It is a supportable walk (using the enclosed people-mover walkway) to both the Yamanote Line train and the Hibya Line subway. I also enjoy the many restaurants, bars, and shops in the area between the hotel and the station. In particular, we love a small Italian pizzeria called Da Pasquale, a block's walk from the hotel.

In sum, it's a happy coincidence that my company's Tokyo office is in Ebisu, as that has allowed me to get to know the wonderful service and impressive facilities at the Westin.

2,REDACTED,en,4219,"This is our family's favorite hotel in Tokyo simply based on our all pleasurable stays in the past. Thisntime, it was even more special. My family and I checked in one day before the big earthquake. This is probably our 8 or 9th time staying here so everything was usual until the earthquake hit. We have a 5 year old and a 15 month old and we were in their elevator going up to our floor and the elevator suddenly got shaky, stopped momentarily and moved again. It stopped and it's door was opened on the next floor, and first we thought the elevator was broken. We all rushed out with our kids and realized the whole building was shaking and swinging, the elevators were banging loudly... I'm from California and somewhat used to earthquake and first thought it wasn't a big deal. But it didn't take me too long to realize this one is big. There was a small table in front of the elevators so we rushed our kids underneath and within seconds, I see hotel staffs assigned on each floor to assist anyone who needs help. When it finally got calm down, we were assisted with three staffs to walk down and out of the building safely. They definitely knew what to do and prepared for any emergencies. Everyone was out, including all staffs with their indoor uniform on and it was quite windy and chilly at that time but everyone was doing their job with smile on their face taking very good care of each and every guests there. Safety inspection took about an hour or more and staffs took all available chairs, blankets, sheets and even towels out making sure guests are being taken care of. They started serving hot teas, distributing bottled water... I was also so impressed how calm and orderly Japanese guests were.
When guests were allowed back into the lobby, it became late afternoon and they started serving hor d'oeurvres and pastries making sure guests comfortable. They realized many shops and restaurants in the area are closed, and they started serving all guests at their buffet restaurant around the clock on the house! They were even apologetic for food quality not at their top shape due to it's ""emergency"". Food was fine. Very good.
Every single one of the staffs took so good care of each guests, we felt safe even with 2 little kids traveling with us. We left Tokyo 3 days after the earthquake, and we had a very good stay and enjoyed the neighborhood just as we always had.

I believe their assistant manager was in charge of dealing with this incident right after the earthquake and he was very professional and showed great leadership. My wife wanted to send a thank you letter but can't remember his name. Tall Japanese guy with short, almost shaved hair. Well, thank you and thank you everyone at Westin Tokyo making us feel at home every time we visit.",5,2011/03/30

2,REDACTED,en,4221,"I have been once earlier in Tokyo staying that time in the Hilton Tokyo hotel as a Hilton D member.
My stay in that hotel was one of the best ever so I was again going to stay in that fabulous hotel. Because I pay my hotel bills by myself as a leisure traveller the price of the stay does matter and I looked also for other hotels. At he time I was travelling I found The Westin Tokyo cheaper although I calculated what to get as a Hilton D member compared to Starwood Basic member. So I found some hints in here Tripadvisor how somebody has uppgraded her room at a very reasonable price. So I asked at the reception how much the uppgrade would be and it was much more expensive than I supposed it to be. When I got my room I was very happy that I did not pay more for uppgrade because my room was really wonderful and luxurious. Because there was shopping center very near to hotel I arranged my own executive lounge by shopping very nice and fresh food from Mitsukoshi. I even get information about the Sushi varities from always friendly japanese people who were customers in that store without asking. Thank you again because the food was excellent!
To me it took one day to recover of the flight from Finland to Tokyo but after that I was ready to use the train and metro system of Tokyo. But it In Ebisu the distance to stations from the hotel was quite reasonable because I like to walk around in foreign cities.
So before this stay my best hotel experience was Hilton Tokyo at the Executive Floor.Now I can say that The Westin hotel experience was equal fabulous even though I was staying at the Starwood Preferred Guest floor. My brother has the Platinium card of Starwood and although I have been i many Starwood hotels with him I naturally get no points in order to get a higher Starwood card. Actually the distance between these hotels is not so big as I thought before my trip.
So what did this hotel so excellent? Of course my room but also the staff who worked very nicely staying at the background. They were all the time available but not intrusive.
I think that the Westin Tokyo did everything that hotel can in order to make my visit so comfortable. Thank you again!
So if you have to choose between these two hotels I'm very convinced that both are so excellent that if you will get a good deal and the location is good for you so do not have to look no further.",5,2011/02/25
2,REDACTED,en,4222,"The Westin Tokyo is one of the better Starwood hotels that I've stayed at. I travel pretty frequently and have stayed at numerous Starwood hotels and I have to say that the service provided here was second to none. It probably didn't hurt that I was a Platinum member.

Even prior to my arrival, the staff helped me with several requests I had in regards to the room. I was traveling with 3 other guests so 2 rooms were booked during our stay. The hotel and staff helped us by getting us 2 rooms adjacent to each other. With one being a suite and the rooms connected, it felt like a large 2 bedroom apartment and was extremely comfortable for the 4 of us.

Our trip to Tokyo was relatively short so we wanted to try and cram as much into 3 days as possible. The concierge helped us with our selections of restaurants, entertainment, shopping, etc. B/c we were out most of the day, most of our time at the hotel was spent eating breakfast and sleeping. The breakfast there is fantastic. As a platinum member, you have a choice to eat at the starwood preferred lounge or at the restaurant on the main level. Although there was a bit of a mixup with the hotel not recognizing my status during our first breakfast (had to speak with like 3 different staff members), they cleared it up and we didn't have any issues the rest of our stay. As I mentioned previously, the rooms were excellent and getting the rest we needed each night, to prepare for the long days that followed, was a non issue b/c the beds were so comfortable. We were in Tokyo for only 3 days but we saw so much that I think we really got a good feel of what Tokyo had to offer.

When I go back to Tokyo, I will definitely be staying at the Westin Tokyo",5,2011/02/23

2,REDACTED,en,4224,"I cannot stress it enough - the service on this hotel was amazing! I've travelled to many places in the past 2 years and have not had equivalent full hotel service as I've had at the Westin Tokyo. You will not that I did not score the highest mark for Location, but it's still in a pretty good spot. It takes about 2 hours via Airport Limousine Bus from Narita to the hotel. It is a 10 min walk to Ebisu station for either the JR Line or the Subway. Even on a cold February day it was an easy walk. 

As for service, I had contacted Mirei prior to my trip and she ensured everything was perfectly setup. She not only forwarded me plenty of information, she also arranged a tour for me and contacted the concierge on my behalf for other questions. And, to top it all off, when i arrived there was a welcome packet full of information, maps, guides, and anything else that one could need. This was well over the top from any of my hotel experiences in the past year, including many TripAdvisor top rated hotel. 

if you are going to Tokyo I can highly recommend the Westin Tokyo. The service all around was top notch and Mirei really topped it all off. I hope to return to both Tokyo and the Westin soon.",5,2011/02/13
2,REDACTED,en,4225,"Stayed in a club room for 12 nights. Room was hard to book as the internet engine was being funny. They did make restaurant reservations for us over email in advance however, and this was most useful.

Was very nicely decorated with poilte, freindly, helpful staff and large rooms. Also had an excellent view from level 20. Found the hotel a bit expensive, however, as even in the club rooms internet was 900 yen (half price...) and they did not waive the (3000JPY) cover charge for guests for the band on the one night we wanted to visit the Compass Rose bar on the top floor. Not sure if there was a charge on other nights but the bar was nowhere near full. Just a little thing.

They have a 1 Michelin Star Chinese restaurant and a few other bars and restaurants around the place. Didn't eat at any of them unfortunately, so i'm unsure what they were like. Chateau Joel Robuchon over the road was amazing, however.

Breakfast was nice with a huge selection in the lobby restaurant. Would have been pricey if it wasn't included in the rate though, as it was 3800JPY pp from memory. Never had the club breakfast, and the nibbles at night time would not have been a sufficient replacement for dinner like they can be at some hotels. The selection also was very similar each night so got old very fast. A bit more variety would have been nice. The drinks are self pour with the standard selection of house spirits and some wines. Internet is free and wireless in the club. It was also very quiet during the week then packed on weekends for (I think) local weddings.

Service at the club was good but we never asked them to do anything very taxing. The concierge was excellent, booking us restaurants and having the local map with subway directions written on sent to our rooms while we were out each day. Could not fault the staff, especially the concierges.

The location is excellent. Yebisu Garden Place doesn't have the whole 'big city' feel to it that other areas may have, so you don't step out onto a roaring road surrounded by skyscrapers. The nearest and most convenient station is Ebisu and you can get there entirely undercover if needed, with moving walkway about half the distance, ~10 min walk. There's plenty of nearby restaurants for all budgets and tastes from convenience stores to 3 Michelin Star kitchens. Ebisu station is on the Yamanote line, the main circle around Tokyo, and also the Hibiya subway line which cuts southwest to north eastish.

The surrounding area is rather pleasant to walk through too. All in all, absolutely loved the location and the service but would probably not go for a club room again as I couldn't justify the extra money for the benefits. Will definately be back to Tokyo and it's about 70-30 (in favour) as to whether we stay at the Westin again.",4,2011/02/11
2,REDACTED,en,4226,"We went up to Tokyo on short notice. I try to stay at Starwood properties when possible. I am a Platinum member in the SPG program. This Westin is the benchmark that you can judge all others with. 
The room was very ""elegant"" , perhaps decorated more in a Ritz Carlton style and less of the Westin worldwide ""clean and modern"" style that I am used to. They use lots of pink and green marble all over, and shiny brass with dark wood. The place oozes ""refinement"" and sets the stage for the experience. 
Room was great. They have a business lounge on the 17th floor that we used for 5 hours , all the while drinking coffee and French bubbly water for free until the free cocktail hour that started at 5:30...I wanted to rent a business room but they were all full. The lounge turned out to be a much better choice. 
For dinner we went to the Australian fair buffet on the first floor. It seems like every month they have a featured country for the buffet and February of 2011 was Australian. We had a feast for considering how much we ate and the quality of the food was a very fair price. 
It was a nice hotel and I would recommend it to anyone. We paid about 25,000 yen. 
Footnote. I forgot my computer's AC adaptor in the room when I checked out. With one call to the front desk they sent it to me, free of charge. I have left things in my room all over the world but this is the first time that 1. They found what I ""Lost"". 2. They sent it to me free of charge. I can say nothing negative about the Westin Tokyo. 
I like this place and you will too.

2,REDACTED,en,4227,Stayed here twice abd thoroughly enjoyed it both times. Well-located within an easy walking distance of Ebisu Station; lots of great restaurants (all price ranges) & bars nearby; and first class Westin service and amenities. Hotel breakfast also a sumptuous spread. We'll stay here every time we visit Tokyo.,5,2011/01/24
2,REDACTED,en,4228,"My Husband is a loyal Starwood guest and was thrilled to find a great rate at the Westin for our recent honeymoon to Japan (and then Hawaii where we didn't stay on a Starwood property - to his dismay). We spent 4 nights at the Westin in Tokyo, traveled to Osaka and Kyoto for a few nights - and then returned to the Westin. My main complaint about this hotel is that it is too Western. I would have preferred a more Japanese experience - especially a heated Japanese toilet seat (weird to say here - but true). I was VERY disappointed to discover a regular low-tech toilet in our bathroom. The hotel is a bit dated - but the location was great and the staff could not have been nicer. When we returned from our field trip to Kyoto we felt like we were coming home!",4,2011/01/11
2,REDACTED,en,4229,"I have been traveling to Tokyo for over 30 years and feel this is the best hotel. The hotel itself is great and has large rooms, not something typical in Tokyo. The staff was great and very helpful. Food was great, breakfast buffet was large and had a real variety. Everything was very fast and efficient. Something business travelers really need.",5,2010/12/31
2,REDACTED,en,4230,"This must be my 7 or 8th time at this wonderful hotel in great neighborhood. Rooms are very large especially the ones on SPG Preferred floors. Although the decor and 'feel' is not really my style, I always go back to this hotel for several reasons. - Large standard rooms, great laid back neighborhood but very easy commute to shibuya, roppongi, shinjuku..., top notch service but just enough so it's not intrusive which I really appreciate. List can go on, but after all, I feel home when I am at this hotel.",5,2010/12/21
2,REDACTED,en,4231,"Yes the rooms are fantastic but the rest is pure disappointment. As a platinum guest I get a gift for being a loyal member. At this hotel one of the choices, printed on a very nice card, was a 5 usd food credit. With that I can buy PART of a coke from the minibar. Not a full coke mind you. 
Staff is so polite but behind all the smiles is sheer arrogance and a very unhelpful group. If you speak to a manager they do help but who wants to have to do that? Not me. Location stinks you are not near anything. No ATM in the hotel but they are happy to exchange your money at rates that will blow your mind. The bed and pillows are not heavenly 
Many better choices with great staff not here.",1,2010/12/16
2,REDACTED,en,4232,"Second time at this hotel, and it's better than what I remembered. Great location, with a train station very near, and shopping mall across the street. It's in a much quieter area of Tokyo, so you are not surrounded by glaring neon lights 24/7. Definitely will stay there next time I'm in town!",5,2010/12/02
2,REDACTED,en,4233,"My last stay at the Westin Ebisu Garden Place was more than 10 years ago. At that time, it was one of the better options in Tokyo and was well worth the premium versus other properties in the city.

I stayed there again in November and very little has changed at the property in the last 10 years. The design of the lobby and rooms is the same. The service remains good and the overall experience is exceptional for a Westin. 

The rooms feel a bit more like a very traditional Ritz Carlton (i.e., your grandmother / grandfather’s vision of luxury – lace, marble, and a bit of a French boudoir feel). The lobby is over the top marble and baroque statuary. Not my style but good quality and a very popular place for wedding photos. A noticeable improvement in the last 10 years is the upgrade to the lobby restaurant and buffet – which is underrated and a nice find.

The one thing that has changed in the last 10 years is that Tokyo now has far more luxury hotel options. A good rate at these properties (Mandarin, Peninsula, Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton) isn’t that much more than the 30,000 JPY+ rate often charged at the Westin. 

Best things about the property:

- high quality rooms and service, much better than the “typical” Westin
- great location in Ebisu. Near Shibuya / Harajuku but a quieter area with great restaurant choices
- large rooms (much larger than the Cerulean Tower which is a close competitor in terms of price point and location)
- excellent in-house dining facilities

Opportunities for improvement:

- pricing level sometimes too close to the new 5-star luxury properties which makes the Westin a non-competitive choice
- disappointing spa treatments. Masseuses are a little too dainty for the job. Although the bathing facilities are nice, the treatment areas are uninspiring",4,2010/11/30
2,REDACTED,en,4234,"Located across from Ebisu Garden, a large shopping complex with lots of restaurant choices, grocery store and subway, the Westin Tokyo is ideally suited for sightseeing. In addition to the extremely polite Japanese society, the service at the hotel was out standing. Only wish the hotel would dis-allow smoking in the hall-ways of rooms that are suppose to be non-smoking.

Our guest room was spot less, well appointed and was excellently maintained. Our room was on the 7th floor facing Ebisu Garden, and had view of Mount Fuji at day break and sun set. Quite spectacular.

The restaurant for breakfast had excellent choices and the staff were very attentive.",5,2010/11/28
2,REDACTED,en,4235,"We stayed at the Westin Tokyo on SPG Points, so given that fact, it was a great value! The neighborhood (which is quite upscale) will feel familiar to expats (there's a McDonald's, a pub, etc.) but that was fine for us for the initial few days of our trip which is when we stayed - gave us the chance to get to know the Toyko layout from a point of familiarity. The proximity to the subway is superb (after a 16 hour flight, we were happy to take the train/subway to Meguro and walk through the shopping mall to the Westin - easy to navigate even in super jetlagged state) and we loved walking to nearby Ebisu for dinner - lots of younger, casual and more local restaurants around that area. Perfectly clean, spacious room with great view of Tokyo from our high floor. For those familiar with Westin properties in the United States and their muted, modern style, be aware that the Westin Tokyo is not that aesthetic - think more gilt details, oriental rugs, etc.! It's certainly not very Japanese (hey, it is a Westin after all) but I thought a great value, especially given that, again, we stayed on SPG points (and from what I recall it was quite a reasonable points-per-night). If you stay there, make sure to try Ippudo, it's The Best! We have one here in NYC, but I think it's the only one in the U.S.",4,2010/11/15
2,REDACTED,en,4236,"I spent 3 nights here. The room is so spacious with area to watch TV, sleep, work, and if you want to do yoga, you probably can too. Not that i did though. :)

TV is very big i think it's 42"" but not a lot of english speaking channel. if you have laptop filled with movie, might be worth it to bring your own HDMI cable to watch from the big screen.

Bathroom is impressive because it is so big. with bathtub and shower area separated. I did soaked in the tub after long day of walking in tokyo. But the con for bahtroom is ""NO Fancy Toilet""

Internet is offered for free for Gold Member. So it was very useful for me. 

Location is not great. Off Ebisu station for about 10 minutes walk. The walk is nice though, not out on the street kinda walk. it has walk way and things to see along the way. 

Love the 7-11 on the way from Ebisu to hotel. I stopped there for milk and fruit juice before returning to hotel at night.",4,2010/11/04
2,REDACTED,en,4237,"Like many Starwood guests, we were choosing between the Sheraton and the Westin for our four night visit in Tokyo. We chose the Westin even with the premium of additional Starpoints, and never regretted it. The hotel is really in a league of its own. The location is good, with nearby restaurants and fairly easy subway access. Our stay was during the midst of Typhoon Chaba, so the rain complicated getting around a bit, but no complaints on the location. The rooms were standard size but typical Westin elegant. As a platinum we were upgraded to a high floor city view, and the view was simply breathtaking, looking over miles of city lights with a prominent landmark of the Tokyo Tower. Complimentary breakfast was included for Platinums with Japanese or American food, cook to order stations, and a broad selection of choices. Coffee was pressed personally for each guest, the restaurant was roomy, comfortable and the service impeccable. We had great support from the concierge, who was not only helpful but really went out of her way to understand our travel goals in Tokyo and proactively advised on some great suggestions. We had some issues with noise in the adjacent room on two of the four nights. On the second night, the manager got personally involved, made ammends for our inconvenience and was truly apologetic that we had experienced any discomfort at all. It was an annoying situation but handled so professionally. If you stay at the Westin, you can check your big luggage to the Westin Kyoto for instance, or to the Narita airport, for a very nominal fee (less than $20 per bag), making travel on the bullet train much simpler and easier. The bullet trains only accomodate carry on size bags, not full size suitcases. Compared to the other hotels on my Japanese trip, the Westin Tokyo set the standard for excellence in service on all levels. If you can justify the extra Starpoints, they are points well spent.",5,2010/11/04
2,REDACTED,en,4238,"If you're a fan of big hotels you'll like the Westin in Tokyo. I think I was out off as soon as I walked through the doors - admittedly after a long and indirect flying route - to be confronted with a Christmas Wonderland! It was the 1st November and I probably sound like Scrooge, but I was all a bit much.

The location is good, a little out of the high rise craziness and on the Yamanote Line (a must for a tourist), but i found myself having to leave at least 45mins before each meeting downtown which takes a while to reach by taxi. I ordered room service on my first night, the French onion soup is good and the service was fast and friendly.

For a big hotel I was frustrated by the need to dial reception to get online, the same old Westin toiletries grate on me a little and there was only one English tv channel. The hair dryer was one of this silly little travel versions (it baffles me that hotels provide travel hairdryers, if that was going to be helpful, I would invest in my own!)",3,2010/11/01
2,REDACTED,en,4239,"This is a great business hotel. It is very well located in Tokyo. You can easily get there on the JR line or the subway. There are many good restaurants located within walking distance, as well as great shopping. I had a killer view of tokyo from a corner room - ask for one if they have it.

Terrific room service too.",5,2010/10/18
2,REDACTED,en,4240,"We stayed here for 15 nights in September through to October. My husband was on business in Tokyo & organised a conference at the hotel. Everything was great, the staff were very helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble. The rooms are large compared with most hotels & ours was always spotlessly clean. The location is very good, with a couple of streets of cafes & bars just round the corner, a shopping centre over the road & the train station a short walk away.
I highly recommend this hotel to business or leisure travellers.",5,2010/10/17
2,REDACTED,en,4241,"I booked a stay at Westin Tokyo for 6 nights, at 20,000 Starwood points per night. This is a Catagory 6 hotel, so the expectation is very high and I was pleasantly surprised that the service is beyond excellent. I am a Starwood Platinum member and travel quite a bit for leisure, so I have other good properties to compare with, including St Regis Beijing and Shanghai. 

Though TripAdvisor, I found Mirei Ri at Westin and contact her prior to my arrival. I highly recommend that you connect with Mirei, as she is an invaluable resource and she will make your stay perfect. I can give you her email, if you send me a message.

Pre-Arrival:
I contacted Mirei, in hopes of getting an upgrade to a suite. Unfortunately, the hotel was booked, so was not able to get a suite, but I was able to get an excellent room with a great view of the city and Tokyo Tower on the Executive Club floor (17th floor). I also requested a special US DVD player and empty mini-bar, both requests were filled. Mirei also provided much info on transportation, shopping, local attractions, which was VERY helpful!

Airport Transfer:
The Airport Limousine bus counter is located just outside of Narita Terminal 1 baggage claim and I am sure they have one at Terminal 2 as well. The cost is 3,000 Y and go to stop 13 at the curb after you purchase your ticket. Takes 1 hour and goes to the front door at Westin, departs at 25 min past the hour. Orange and white bus...can't miss it. www.limousinebus.co.jp

Check In:
For the Executive Club, you can go directly up to the 17th floor and there is a separate desk there to check you in. The check in was very welcoming, as I got to meet Mirei and the general manager of the hotel, Andreas Trauttmansdorff...That is really VIP treatment!

Guest Room:
Although it was not the suite that I hoped for, the room was very nice and I loved that it was located so close to the Executive Club Lounge. The view was awesome and the room had the standard Japanese DVD and the special US DVD player with small flat panel TV, also available are On Demand movies. There is also a DVD store right next door, if you want to rent and a movie theater across the street at Yebisu Garden Place, (no English movies when I was there).

In the room is a desk, loveseat, Westin Heavenly Bed. The bathroom has separate tub and shower, robe, slippers and the best Bvlgari toiletries...heavenly! Two in room safes, including one for laptop with outlet for recharging. You will love the heated toilet seat. 

The mini-bar was emptied, so I could put soda and snacks inside and there was coffee maker (with coffee)+ hot water dispenser (with tea), 1 free bottle water per day. The air conditioning in the room was the BEST! It was unbearably hot in Tokyo in early Sept ( the room was my oasis at the end of the day). There were no suites available and other Platinum members I met, were also not able to get these larger rooms, probably because this property doesn't have that many. 

Mirei also had chocolate mints waiting for me in the room and I had requested more, they were so yummy! Mirei (with special help from the IT staff) got my iPhone connected to the Wifi in the room! Daily newspaper is provided. Platinum members get the room internet with no charge, otherwise, I think there is a small fee.

I also got extra hangers (always need those) and electrical adapter. 

Executive Club Floor:
Breakfast is included with the Executive Club floor rooms and for Platinum guests. The choice is the buffet breakfast at The Terrace Restaurant on the first floor (normally 3600 Y) and you will be tempted by the large selection, including pastries, toast, bagel, fresh squezzed orange and grapefruit juice, fruit, yogurt, cereal, eggs, sausage, bacon, pancakes, salad, pasta, fish, japanese breakfast ( pickled vegetables, miso, rice) and much more. The restaurant is very crowded on the weekends. 

The other option is the relaxing breakfast in the Exec Club Lounge with all the basic options. Room service is also available and the Continental Breakfast is about 3000 Y.

During the day, the Executive lounge features beverages and pastries and Happy Hour from 5:30 - 7:30 pm with drinks, snacks and yummy hor d'oeurves. Also, it is a gathering space and I met other guests. 

Restaurants:
There are many restaurant options at the hotel, although I did not eat at any of them, including on the 22nd floor Victors (Continental), Yebisu (Teppanyahi), Compass Rose (lounge) 2nd floor Ryutenmon (Chinese), Mai (Japanese), 1st floor, The Bar, Lounge and Terrace. 

Across the street at Yebisu Garden Place, they have many restaurants, and on the top floor of the office building and in the ground floor of the Mitsukoshi department store, there is a fantastic food hall and gourmet grocery store (not to be missed). At the Ebisu subway station, there are so many budget, but gourmet food options.

Transportation and Location:
I found that the hotel location was ideal, it was a short walk (even in the heat) to the Ebisu subway station, where you could get anywhere in Tokyo. The Skywalk is just past the Yebisu Garden Place (across the street from Westin, which features the famous Joel Robuchon restaurant). Taxis are readily available at the hotel also (800 Y just to hop in).

The metro station is a little confusing, as there are 2 metro lines running (JR Yamanote Line and Hibiya Subway). It is a major hub, so it is very easy to get to your destination from here. You can get( for a 500 Y deposit) a reloadable Pasmo subway card that will remain in your wallet and you just wave it over the turnstile and also can be used at convenience stores and restaurants. 

Hotel Amenities:
The free Westin WORKOUT is located on the 4th floor next to the Le Spa Parisien. You can use the spa facilities with a Day Pass with I think is about 3500 Y. The Swedish 60 min massage is 16,800 Y and in room massage is also available with a 20% discount during certain hours. There is also Westin Kids Club and Business Center. I believe they have arrangements for nearby pool use, if you desire. There is no ATM, but one located at the metro station or in the office bldg at Yebisu.

Tokyo:
I had booked a one day sightseeing tour on the web via Viator, prior to arrival and Mirei helped me confirm the pick up at the hotel. The bus tour included the main sights of Tokyo, Meiji Shinto Shrine, Imperial Palace Garden (tons of mosquitos here), Asakusa temple, lunch, bay cruise near Rainbow Bridge and waterfront Aqua City shopping mall. Book online ahead of time and it is less than when you book with hotel concierge. 

Mirei also helped me with information on the Tsukiji Fish Market, which I 
recommend. You dont have to go to the Fish Auction at 4:30 am and the fish market is a fun, unique experience and there are many casual places to grab fresh sushi. 

The best shopping experience is at the new Marunouchi district. You casually stroll the tree and art lined street Nakadori with the high end stores, like Hermes. At one end of the street is the gorgeous Peninsula Hotel and the other is, the not to be missed Shin-Marunouchi Building (several floors also filled shops and restaurants). The Tokyo National Museum in Ueno Park is nice and there are other museums here to visit. 

My local friend took me to Roppongi area for dinner at Gonpachi, which is a lively place with locals and visitors alike. They have many Japanese ""tapas style small dishes"" here to share and very affordable!

Definitely would highly recommend the Westin Tokyo and recommend the Executive Club Floor rooms, which offer numerous amenities. The outstanding service can't be beat and anything you need will be taken care of. It was so nice of Mirei to see me off in my taxi and made me sad to say goodbye! I also received very nice emails from both Mirei and the general manager after my departure!

2,REDACTED,en,4242,"Have stayed in great hotels world wide. This one rates at the top. We were dusty and carrying only back packs, having shipped our luggage ahead to the Westin some days previously (great system by the way). The staff did not miss a beat despite our appearance - throughout our stay all hotel staff were super polite, helpful and accommodating. We upgraded to club and enjoyed a fabulous room with fine inlaid wood furnishings, an exquisite bath, lots of toiletries, nice yakutas and slippers ect, great linens and a view that at night felt like an infinity pool of lights: there were floor to ceiling windows looking toward the downtown of Tokyo. The club floor offered nice happy hour snacks and drinks plus a very good breakfast of mixed Japanese and westerns treats. The buffet was equally available to us (included with room) on the main floor. It was vast! Don't go there on Sunday though unless you book ahead - it is a fancy and popular place for family brunch. The hotel offers access to a fitness center in the mall which can be reached from the lower level of the hotel so you don't need to go outside.

The hotel is located in a quieter area of Tokyo which frankly is rather a relief from much of the city density. Still, it is well served with indoor/outdoor shopping center attached, great restaurants around and a skywalk moving sidewalk to the Ebisu Subway Station. The station is on a the main JR line that circles Tokyo, so it is easy to get to - look for the East Gate sign when you get off the train. As you approach that exit you will see the skywalk. Looking straight ahead, you can see the Westin sign as you reach the very end of the skywalk: hotel is situated on the far side of the mall. We did discover that you can walk inside through the mall if it is raining. Stay to the right when leaving the skywalk and head down a level. Then you can walk through to the far side of the mall and via a sort of tunnel at the end, straight into the lower level of the hotel. The hotel web is quiet poor for directions unless you are driving - but we found it easily enough at the end. 

Importantly, we discovered that the tall office towers on one side of that pretty shopping mall had two full floors at the top for restaurants. Some had almost theatre style seating that allowed a superb view for everyone. There must have been 20 +restaurants up there - all different. and ranging from pub style to very expensive. You take the elevators inside the tower lobby",5,2010/08/09
2,REDACTED,en,4243,"My husband and I stayed here for a week in July.A beautiful hotel but not centrally located.The hotel is a 10-15 minute walk to the subway.With taxis being so expensive in Tokyo,subways are the way to travel.The rooms are very adequate similar to Hampton Inn rooms,very dark lighting and hallways did not seem to be air conditioned..It was very hot during our stay and there is no swimming pool...service was very good and breakfast was excellent .This hotel is in a quieter area.If you do not mind travelling 20-30 minutes to get to the centre of things and don't want a swimming pool,this hotel is ideal.",4,2010/07/27
2,REDACTED,en,4244,"This the very best Westin hotel I have been to, being a grade above the rest of the chain.

The rooms are spacious and luxuriously furnished, with very high quality throughout.

The hotel's location is not the most convenient, being a 7+ minutes walk from Ebisu station using covered moving walkways. It is also near the end of its airport limousine route. However the area is pleasant, upscale, and has many eateries with character, a nice contrast with hotels located in business districts.

I found service at this hotel to be exceptional, with capable, eager, gracious, and genuine staff going out of their way to fulfill even little requests. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2010/07/27
2,REDACTED,en,4245,"Location was great! All kinds of neat little restaurants nearby. Ebisu garden place accross the street was a nice place to walk around. Check out the large supermarket there on the bottom level of the department store. It was great! You can take the escalator down one floor from the Westin lobby, and there's a tunnel under the street that takes you right to it. 
The staff at The Westin Tokyo are top notch! The housekeeping staff did a great job. Rooms were very clean. Beds were comfortable. 
The (orange) airport bus going to Narita Airport stops right in front of the hotel and runs all day. It's only about $35 each way. 

We enjoyed our stay very much.",5,2010/06/15
2,REDACTED,en,4246,"My fiance and I stayed here for one week. We have stayed at several starwood properties around the world, but our experience at the Westin Tokyo was absolutely one of our favorites. Knowing that we had an upcoming wedding, Mirei Ri along with the staff greeted us with champagne and a congratulatory note along with a helpful packet of information about the city and hotel. 

As a platinum member, we were upgraded to an executive floor room and then a suite. Both rooms were wonderful. While we agree with other reviews that the decor is more reminiscent of the Sheraton brand, this in no way compromises the overall feel of a very clean, modern, luxurious, inviting and calming space. The Westin amenities and touches were still prevalent and of course the heavenly bed was very plush and comfortable. 

All of the facilities including the gym, executive lounge, breakfast buffet at the Terrace restaurant and at Mai were outstanding. All of the staff were extremely patient and helpful and answered any questions we had. Additionally, several staff members remembered our names and greeted us throughout the hotel. For example, after seeing us wait at Mai for breakfast, one staff ran into us later on that day and asked us how our breakfast was. It was details like this that truly separated this hotel with other ones. 

The location of the hotel along with the surrounding area would perfect for any type of trip--- family vacation, business, romantic getaway, etc. The Yebisu Garden Place across the street offers great restaurants, shopping and even a beer museum! Atre at the Ebisu JR station is also a great place to buy nicely packaged souvenirs and gifts. Otherwise, you can get to any of the popular Tokyo areas (Shibuya, Harajuku Shinjuku, Ueno, Tokyo, Asakusa, Ginza, Tsukiji, etc.) within a short train ride. 

I travel frequently for work and have stayed at many hotels in Asia and around the world for extended periods. However, the Westin Tokyo will always remain a personal favorite and I can't wait to come back on my next trip to Tokyo.",5,2010/06/07
2,REDACTED,en,4247,"Loved the hotel which is well located near the Shibuya area.
The front desk staff were really welcoming and helpful. The only complaints I would have is that I found the lighting in the room inadequate and quite dark, this is personal decor taste as it was a slightly older hotel. You also had to pay to use the spa heat facilities which in other hotels are free of charge to hotel guests. Treatments are quite pricy but thats the going rate in all Tokyo hotels. As a keen runner they provide a pleasant running map which was very enjoyable early morning. The best part about the stay was the breakfast buffet, it was incredible with amazing selection and choice, great bread station - really well done to the F&B team there.
I would definitely recommend this hotel!!",5,2010/05/30

I was there for a business trip and was given a very nice big room.
The bed was so comfortable and the toilet was so big too!

I was very comfortable staying there for ten days didn't want to go home.",5,2010/05/30
2,REDACTED,en,4249,"Fellow travelers to Tokyo,

My wife and I stayed at the Westin Tokyo for our honeymoon and could not have been happier. First off Mirei Ri personally helped plan our stay and answered our transporation questions from Narita to the Westin. The limousine bus Mirei Ri recommended stops right outside the hotel and takes about 1h 45minutes from Narita terminal 2.

Once inside the hotel you are treated to a very elegant lobby and a friendly and professional check in. We were escorted to our room by Ms. Tomita who was friendly and answered all our questions. The beautiful room we had faced east and had an incredible view of the Tokyo tower and the Roppongi area. The room was immaculately clean and comfortable. The impeccable bathroom had a large walk in shower as well as a tub. The bed was heavenly as promised, and the room had blackout curtains for sleeping in darkness.

If you stay at the Westin we highly recommend the Executive Lounge on the 17th floor. The views are incredible and you have a long list of benefits including: free wireless, happy hour drinks, breakfast in the morning and the room is tended to at all times should you have any questions. 

Another incredible feature of the Westin is the personal attention you receive. We needed a map printed to get to a location at 4am to visit the fish market, and Mr. Jun Shigeta (Westin Host) not only printed out the map for us, but also hand delivered it to us while we were in the lounge. Furthermore the staff are very knowledgeable about the local area and speak excellent English.

The Westin is located in Ebisu right near the Garden Place which has loads of shops and the Mitsukoshi department store. If you are a fan of gourmet food make sure to go to the Mitsukoshi food garden area in the bottom floor. It is incredible. The Ebisu train station is about 800 meters from the door of the Westin to the entrance of the station. There is a moving walkway most of the way to the station so at most you walk about 100 meters. From the Ebisu station you are one stop to Shibuya, 2 stops to Harajuku, and 2 stops to Roppongi. The location is great.

If you are headed to Tokyo this is the place to stay. A big thanks to Ms. Ri, Mr. Shigeta, Ms. Tomita,and Mr. Trauttsmansdorff for making our stay incredible.",5,2010/05/29
2,REDACTED,en,4250,I regularly travel on business in Asia Pacific and when in Japan I look forward to returning to The Westin Tokyo. Every aspect of this hotel is first class. With easy access to all business areas of the city it is also a great area of Tokyo to walk around of an evening to wind down and discover a fascinating array of local bars and restaurants. The stay makes you feel special.,5,2010/05/21
2,REDACTED,en,4251,"We stayed one night at The Westin Tokyo and It was rather disappointing. We had stayed at this hotel before and I was hoping that this stay would be better. 
Its an old looking hotel, much more in theme with the Sheraton branch of Starwood hotels. Very classic ornate. 
The room we were upgraded to was a non-smoking as we had requested but the room still smelled of smoke and there were cigarette butts on the windowsill... The bathroom was all a bit dated with none of the new/modern fixtures you would expect in this standard of hotel.
The Club lounge was completely full but at least we got in - on our last stay there wasn't room !! They really should know how many guests there are in 'Club' rooms and how many more have access and maybe offer drinks tokens to make the bars look busy as an alternative to the lounge. At the tables either side of us were couples idling over tea and fruit juice..... 
The staff on both check in and check out were very friendly and service was just as you would expect in a 5* hotel.

All in all whilst it is a nice hotel the trip just convinced me that next time I'll continue to stay at the ANA Intercontinental.",3,2010/05/20
2,REDACTED,en,4252,"We stayed at the Westin for 4 nights and it was our most enjoyable stay of any Westin property we've ever stayed at. The hotel itself was very grand and modern. Much larger than I expected. Great location and a convenient walk to the nearby JR and subway stations. The Yebisu Garden Place is right next door and provides easy access to restaurants, small shops, and a department store. Around the JR / subway stations are some smaller side streets that had some great local restaurants (Ippudo ramen is walkable and highly recommended).

We booked two rooms on the executive floor - the rooms were very
spacious and had great views of Ebisu. The Heavenly beds were quite
good and comfortable as usual.

One of the perks of the executive floor is the lounge and this lounge
was one of the better lounges in Japan - if not the best. Large space
with abundant seating. Lots of helpful staff to answer any questions
and provide prompt service during cocktail hour. The food served
during cocktail hour was tasty and varied from day to day. The lounge
was normally very quiet and provided a welcome place to relax after
spending busy days in Tokyo.

We regularly ate the buffet breakfast in the Terrace restaurant. Great selection of food - traditional Japanese dishes, Western selections, and French pastries. Everything tasted good and very fresh. We all really enjoyed the croissants and Japanese poached eggs are so rich and creamy. 

The staff went out of their way to ensure our stay was enjoyable. Helpful maps and local guide books were placed in the room before we arrived. Mirei (you'll notice her responses on these reviews) personally greeted us and spent a good amount of time arranging
various details during our stay. She brought us a wonderful cake to help celebrate a birthday. Every staff member - the reservation staff, front desk, concierge, food staff, lounge staff, etc were very courteous and paid a great deal of attention to every detail.

I highly recommend the Westin Tokyo and will be staying here whenever I'm in Tokyo. It's rare to find a hotel that provides such a welcoming atmosphere for foreign visitors, but now that I've found it - I'm not going anywhere else.

To the staff of the Westin Tokyo and especially Mirei - Thanks for making our stay such a wonderful experience.",5,2010/05/08
2,REDACTED,en,4253,"We stayed at the Westin Tokyo for a couple of nights in March and ended with mixed feelings about this hotel. 

First, as someone else mentioned, this is not your typical Westin. I m not too sure to which group this property belonged before becoming the Westin, but the interior is very glitzy with dark red marble, goldish decorations and everything that made a top hotel back in the eighties. So far all the Westins I stayed were more on the modern, contemporary side so it was kind of a shock. 
But despite the interior being very eighties, it is still quite well maintained, and everything is still clean and fine. 
We had a corner room so space was ample which is very rare in the capital city. 
Again, the interior of the rooms were fine and clean but just felt like coming from another age, like some great old Sheraton decades ago. 

Anyway as for location, well, again, it will depend on your liking. It sure is in a very quiet place, which is again very rare in Tokyo, with its pros and cons. 
Pros: well after a long day, it s nice to be in a quiet and relaxed atmosphere away from the constant bustling of the city. 
Cons: well if you are looking for some entertainment, or even restaurants you have no choice but to either take the train or the cab to Shibuya or Shinjuku. There is really nothing within walking distance and the little mall attached to the train station is kind of lame with nothing much inside. 

As for service, again, I noticed that it was very different depending on the staff, which is very unlike Japan where service is usually very good in the whole hotel. 
As for us, we found the service at the reception to be very cold. It was professionnal and fast but we didnt feel welcomed at all. Not a smile, not a welcome, straight to business. That s in stark constrast with the motto of the Westin and everything written on their fancy brochures and sites. 
But some other staff were more friendly, greeting us with a smile every time, and looking eager to help or assist us. 

Overall we ended with mixed feelings. While it was nice to be away from the noise, it was troublesome not to have any restaurants within the area. Again, rooms were spacious and clean but the design really felt outdated. Last, while the staff at the front desk was very cold, others were very friendly and nice to talk to. Last, rates are still reasonable compared to the size and quality of the rooms.",3,2010/04/29
2,REDACTED,en,4254,"I would highly recommend this hotel for its service and amenities.

SERVICE: 
- I emailed the concierge 4 weeks before my trip to plan restaurant reservations for me (I don't speak Japanese and thought this may be difficult, plus we are talking about the Michelin capital of the world here). Even thought I hadn't arrived yet, they communicated with my by email and delighted to help. An itinerary and map was all done and ready for when I arrived.
- the staff were helpful, efficient and very, very polite. Given that tipping is not customary in Japan, it was just all part of the service.

HOTEL AMENITIES
- Rooms were big bright, and in a bustling city like Tokyo, calm and quiet, whith new falt screen tvs and cd/dvd players, and ceiling to floor windows and great views. And yes, they do have those Japanese toilet seats which are warmed, and wash you!
- Gym is big and well equipped. I have stayed in alot of hotels for business and this gym was twice as large as say the W's in Times Square New York.
- I am an SPG member and they have a dedicated checking desk, and floor, and lounge. Lounge had great views and it was nice to sit there and enjoy their drinks while working out the plan for the evening.
- breakfast was included and this was a good selection of Japanese and western food, which was all good quality

LOCATION
- ok, this may divide some people, as it is in Ebisu and about a 4-5minute walk to the subway/train:
I liked this alot; it was quieter, only 1 stop to Harajuku, a couple more to Shibuya (think Times Square) and walking from the hotel to the station, you go through a very nice shopping centre which restaurants, shops and a big supermarket (get your water and sake from here, while eating some of the free samples they thrust at you). It is quiet and easy to get to. If you compare to say Hyatt where I went, a freeway runs near it, and a couple of 7 Eleven type stores nearby, and then that's it!
DOWNSIDE: if you want to use the Airport Limosuine Bus, it is not very frequent. We arrived nad had to wait an hour for the next bus, which visited Westin as the final stop....two hours later! Bit of a downer having travelled on an 11 hour flight from London. 

I would single out the concierge team as really going way out to help you, providing maps, checking subway and train times etc. They were simply fantastic, comparable to the rest of the staff who keep this hotel running so well and so efficiently. 

I would stay here again when I return to Tokyo.",5,2010/04/14
2,REDACTED,en,4255,"My wife and two of our boys (aged 19 and 12) and myself stayed 5 nights at the Westin over Easter from March 31-April 5. We reserved two executive rooms that were located on the 19th floor and we had access to the club room (extremely helpful and pleasant staff always present) on the 17th floor. The hotel can be highly recommended. Having lived earlier in Tokyo near Shibuya we decided to find a hotel conveniently close and Westin fit the bill perfectly. The location is very good even though the trip to and from Ebisu station started to get a bit tiring after a few days. Getting around on the JR and metro is, however, a breeze from Ebisu.

Our rooms were very spacious with very nice views of Tokyo Tower. Rooms were maintained very nicely with tea/coffee and water available in the room. Breakfast could be taken either in the club lounge or just off the lobby. The buffet here was much more extensive than the lounge. We did not otherwise eat at the hotel and prices seemed very high. The cocktail hour was very pleasant with nice snacks offered each day.

I can strongly recommend this hotel. The location is very good and being only a few minutes from Shibuya was well appreciated by our sons who loved the area. Also the Ebisu neighbourhood is very interesting with some excellent and reasonably priced restaurants.

We used the Airport Limousine Bus to/from Narita direct to the hotel and it was very convenient.",5,2010/04/11
2,REDACTED,en,4256,"We traveled with a group of 11 people and had a wonderful stay. The concierge service was wonderful. In a city where people are so busy and english is not the spoken language you must have a good consierge, its worth the money.
The food was delicious, we had breakfast every day. Ebisu is a nice walk away from Harajuku and Shibuya or a 3 minute ride on the train. Our housekeepers were amazing!!! I'm a very messy person when I travel and they went beyond the call of their duty by even arranging my mess to orderly situatied on the table or counter or where ever it was. Front desk and managers were quite helpful. We had sooooo much bags from all the shopping that we did and the bell men were very helpful with holding our bags and keeping them in order to ensure a speedy departure. We even got to meet one of the top executives of the hotel and he was so warm and welcoming to us as guest and even became friends with us. No swimming pool or spa and we had to pay daily for internet, but it's Japan. The concierge directed us to a great spa and we purchased 500 yen cards for the few minutes of internet we needed. We love Japan and the people who have bad reviews just do not understand the culture.",5,2010/04/03
2,REDACTED,en,4257,"We stayed at The Westin for 7 nights and thought it was wonderful. It's 5 star all the way, very big rooms, extremely well maintained and friendly staff. They provided bottled water in the room each day which was appreciated. We took our computer and my only complaint would be the cost of using WIFI in the room however Tokyo does not have a lot of internet cafes so it would be difficult to try and find a cheaper option.
It has a great well equipped gym with treadmills, stepper, cross trainer, weight machines, fit balls, dumbells etc. And the bonus is it has a lovely view and was very quiet and clean.
It's a little bit of a walk to the station (7-10mins) but it is an enjoyable walk and there are moving walkways besides I'd rather be away from the station than right on top of it. 
The wonderful thing about this hotel is the location. Ebisu is a wonderful European style village with lots of greats shops, bars and restaurants. We enjoyed walking around at night and trying lots of different bars, everywhere offered a different experience. After a busy day seeing the sights it is lovely to come back to the Westin in a quieter area. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2010/03/27
2,REDACTED,en,4258,"Great stay in Meguro, a cool neighborhood, just a short walk from subway trains. The suite was very well furnished in a classic Japanese style. The cabinets in particular are a marvel of bidet technology. Don't laugh, you'll see...
The executive lounge had wondeful views and a great light fare buffet. The top floor bar is a great place to have a drink at night. The morning buffet is excellent. I tried the traditional Japanese breakfast, quite interesting...
Excellent service, we were treated light royalty. The gym is well equipped.
Great hotel, would recommend for business or splurging in Tokyo.",5,2010/03/24
2,REDACTED,en,4259,"My wife and I live in Yokohama, and have visited the Westin Hotel periodically (several times per year) over the past 9-years both for staying overnight, and principally for dinners. The location is very difficult to get to, and requires several train/subway changes regardless of where in Tokyo you are coming from. The rooms are okay sized for Japan's typical ketchy/stingy accommodations, but hugely overpriced. Although the economy is always bad in Japan, and thus, customers should be 'king', the Westin (as most Japan hotels do) make the customers feel that we should be grateful for them allowing us into their restaurant. We have observed the constant increase in prices, particularly for the Dinner Buffets in last 2-years, and the constant downward slide in Customer Service. The Westin charges an outrageously (and foolishly) high $80/meal for Buffet-type food that is only slightly above average taste. Most other Hotel Buffets in Tokyo are only charging $35-$55/meal. They charge high prices for by-the-glass wine, and then underpour tiny amounts to conserve their profits. Although Terrace Restaurant has warm-bread service at the tables, they do not announce it to any of the customers, and instead just wait for the customers to complain about no bread before they consider to bring it to table or not. The Wait-Staff are rude and must be hunted-down every time we needed plates cleared or water filled. At the door to restaurant it is nearly impossible to get 'walk-up' entry into restaurant (they set-aside vast majority for reservations that never show up) and attempt to force timed-service on everyone with their restrictive seating times. They then coerce you to leave if you have extended beyond what they consider your time-slot. This makes the customer feel that they are just feeding cattle on a schedule instead of serving their customers. They usually coerce phone-in customers to delay schedule for after 8:30pm (when no reasonable person is still dining), and then if you do agree to eat that late...one finds many of the buffet items empty-plates (we had to scold the cooks for standing around without filling them). Ever since they rennovated the Terrace Restaurant (a look that turned out worse than before), the prices have sky-rocketed as they try to price-gouge the customers to recover the building expenses. Although Weston's lobby is visually one of the prettiest in Tokyo, Foreign Travellers should avoid this Westin Hotel if they want anything like Value-4-Money. Customers leave this hotel feeling cheated and abused. The rooms are too small for price charged, and they attempt to charge you for everything added (e.g. they even make you pay for tea/coffee in the rooms, and charge by-the-person so one must pay twice the cost for husband/wife staying). This is indicative of all Japanese Hotels, and is one of the clear reasons that international travelers only come to Japan when forced to (e.g. business trip).",2,2010/03/15
2,REDACTED,en,4260,"Beautiful, gilded luxury hotel. Not a typical Westin, has far more black marble, gold, and wood paneling than usual. Lobby is large and airy, has a very nice sunken lounge area, a restaurant, gift shop, and business lounge. Biz center computer usage is approx $10 for 45 mins. Only had a quick breakfast in The Terrace, the lobby restaurant, which was fine, and except for the coffee (approx $8), fairly priced. Had roomservice once for dinner which came quick and was delicious. Think the pricing was on the higher side but not too absurd.

Guestrooms are large and afford nice views of surrounding Ebisu. Bathrooms are huge as well, very luxurious and come with a huge amount of amenities, toothbrush, toothpaste, shaver, shaving cream, in addition to the standard shampoo, body wash, etc... Heavenly bed was solid, but not exceptional.

A bottled water was provided free each day, which was a nice touch.

Hotel is located in Ebisu Garden Place. a mixed-use complex with shops, restaurants, apartments and office buildings that wouldn't look out of place in Dallas. Regardless, it's a very upscale neighborhood of Tokyo and is proximate to Ebisu station which is serviced by the JR Yamanote line and the Tokyo metro (subway). Station is about a 10-12 min walk from the hotel, partly through an a long enclosed skywalk. 

Location for visiting Tokyo is very good, but you'll need to take the JR or the subway just a few stops to avoid very long walks. 

We used the concierge a few times and other than just once giving us horrible directions to a nearby restaurant, was otherwise uniformly fantastic. All the service staff in the hotel were fantastic. 

All in all, beautiful hotel and wonderful experience.",5,2010/03/08
2,REDACTED,en,4261,"This was a very clean and conservatively decorated hotel. Highlights included an awesome display by the bartender who chiseled a gem of ice for my drink (there is a device from Japan that makes spheres for Scotch and this was close), a great view, and the Heavenly bed.",5,2010/02/26
2,REDACTED,en,4262,"My friend and I stayed here last year and we were both unhappy with it. He booked it before he came to Japan because he belongs to the Starwoods Hotel group and gets executive club privileges. That really did not seem to matter at the Westin Tokyo. He was treated poorly by the staff at the desk on our 2nd day there. They were really rude and after 5 days there, it seemed like a pattern for certain staff members. They were nice to me when I spoke Japanese but not so nice when having to speak in English to tourists. My friend is a friendly person and talked to many people in many places so it was not like he was a rude guy asking for bad service. The concierge people were not that great either. 

The room was fine, nothing special. The bathroom was very nice and clean. The first floor restaurant was not good at all unless you like all-you-can-eat restaurants with so-so food. That was a surprise to see in a supposedly 5-star hotel. 

The location is pretty bad too. It is a long walk to get to the trains/subways. Or you can take a long taxi ride to get to where the action is. EBISU is a BORING area to stay in. If you want to be isolated from the best spots then stay here. I have stayed in better hotels in Tokyo and I have been in better ones where other guests from home have stayed. 

It was not a great experience at this Westin Hotel. I am a huge fan of the Westin in Kyoto and always make my friends and family stay there so it was disappointing to have such a bad time at the one in Tokyo. 

There are better places...",2,2010/02/02
2,REDACTED,en,4263,"We stayed at the Westin for 8 nights and it well exceeded our expectations. Check in went off without a hitch and all the hotel facilities were explained to us by the friendly concierge members, all who speak excellent english. The room was spacious and modern, which came as a relief coming off a less than impressive stay at a different starwood hotel. The bed (heavenly bed) was all it was made out to be, the TV had a few more english channels than usual and the room was appointed with a lounge and desk. Arranging restaurant reservations and clearing up a few itinerary-related things as well as routes to different destinations was made easy by the concierge. There are also a few helpful booklets around the hotel with suggested itineraries, useful maps etc. 

We were a little disappointed by the fact that the gym, pool and internet facilties were not available to guests without an extra fee since other less expensive hotels had these provided for free (especially internet). I can understand that since the pool is off property (and belongs to an Ebisu lifestyle/fitness club) that it is unrealistic to provide it to guests for free; however, over $10 per usage of the gym and exorbitant charges for internet at a hotel that I imagine caters to many business people is pretty poor. Internet in the business centre is 1000y/45min, laptop rental is around 2000y/day + fees for using the wifi in your room.

During our stay we had breakfast at the Terrace most days, which offers a la carte, and continental or full buffet meals (at around ~1800/3600 yen each respectively) - it was a bit more than we were used to paying but the buffet was pretty extensive so it was worth a try - it's also worth mentioning we found the service was top notch each day. We had dinner in two of the other restaurants on offer - Victor's, the french restaurant, and Ryutenmon, the chinese restaurant - and ordered set meals at each which came at around 13k-14k yen per person (starting at around 10k). Victor's was a little disappointing in terms of value for money and we felt that the portion sizes and quality of the dishes were worth about half of what we paid. However, we were quite happy to pay what we did at Ryutenmon and the set course was truly memorable - highlights including the pork belly, crab and shark fin soup and Japanese beef. I think the fact that this place was packed on an ordinary Thursday night speaks for itself. 

The area is fantastic, with the large Ebisu garden/shopping area just across the street as well as Joel Robouchon's Tokyo restaurant, if you're a fan. Ebisu itself is somewhere in the middle of everything, and the JR station is only a few stops from Shibuya, Shinjuku and Harajuku. At the end of the day it's great to retire to a quieter part of town and get away from it all. Overall we were extremely satisfied with our stay, and if we ever returned to Tokyo would definately stay again.",5,2010/01/23
2,REDACTED,en,4264,"I think everyone reading this knows what to expect when you stay at The Westin - the rooms are fabulous, you have all the creature comforts you'd expect, world-class dining and excellent customer service. I won't dwell on those because The Westin Tokyo lives up to or surpasses every single one of those assumptions.

The location of the hotel is fantastic - about a 10 minute walk from Ebisu Station via a lovely walk through Ebisu Garden Place (where the Sapporo factory is). There is a Starbucks, McDonalds (if you're into that kind of thing) and wine market two minutes from the hotel, very convenient.

The concierge service was outstanding and went above and beyond our expectations in terms of making bookings for us, answering questions, clearly mapping out locations for us and making sure our cab driver was 110% clear on where we needed to go. None of the cab drivers speak English, so this was very important, although you can almost avoid them completely by utilizing the fantastic subway/metro and nearby Ebisu Station.

We stayed over Christmas and paid approx. $250 USD/night which is admittedly a bit steep but not for Tokyo, the most expensive city in the world. In my mind, having a reliable concierge service to help you get where you need to go in a country where no one speaks your language is worth the extra dough. Plus, on the rare occasion we would take a taxi, all of the drivers knew exactly where ""Westin"" was right away without any confusion or awkward moments.

The only downside I can think of is the $18 USD/day charge for use of internet in the room. Not sure if there is a similar charge to use the business center, might be worth looking into because the $18 was kind of a slap in the face when you're already paying a decently high rate to stay there.",4,2009/12/28
2,REDACTED,en,4265,"My best friend and I stayed at this gorgeous property for 5 nights and experienced great hotel staff, beautiful rooms, and amenities. Check-in after a 13 hour flight was painless and efficient. We were given a beautiful and enormous room (450 sq feet) room looking out onto Tokyo Tower with an immense bathroom with an amazing shower and bath tub. The porter accidentally broke the handle on my friends bag and five minutes later we got a call asking if they could fix the bag. We declined because it was falling apart anyway but even the thought is what counted. Every time we called for something, it was promptly brought up to us with a smile and a thank you from one of the hotels international staff members. We were given great advice from the hotel's concierge about where to go and when and what to avoid. All of the meals we had were memorable that the hotel recommended. Not only was this hotel a great value, luxury, and friendly; it has excellent access to the subway system. The hotel designers should really get a big pat on the back for having the hotel connected to the passage way to the subway system. It could not have been easier to get to on a cold day in Tokyo. When I go back to Tokyo this will be my hotel of choice.",5,2009/12/14
2,REDACTED,en,4266,"I just came back from my trip to Tokyo, during which I stayed in Westin. This hotel is located across from Ebisu Garden Place and Tokyo photography museum, which deserves to be tourist attractions in their own right. 

In order to take subway (taxi is quite expensive in Tokyo), you will have to cross this giant mall featuring mid to upscale stores. You can use Ebisu station where both JR and Tokyo Metro lines are. Shibuya, Harajuku and other major Tokyo attraction is a few stations away. I was at first concerned this location is a bit off from the different centers of the city where all the actions take place, but in retrospect, I am sure I made a good decision to stay here because it is a very quite and safe area to stay in without hustle bustle of the city. 

There is a Joel Robuchon bakery and restaurant right across from the hotel, which is another reason why I loved to stay in Westin. The Ebisu Garden Place mall also features glass tower and Mitsukoshi deparment store. This convenient location came in handy on our last day, when there isn't enough time to go to downtown. So, my suggestion is to save the mall for the partial day when you arrive or leave. 

Another important thing to mention in terms of location is Airport Limousine to and from Narita Airport. Since we had huge suitcases, this was really convenient feature. You can just hop on and you are at the airport. FYI, the fare was 3000 yen per person. 

The room was very clean and professionally kept. The room was spacious (unusual for Tokyo), and in addition to quite spacious bathroom sink where you could perform your beauty regimen, there is a vanity where you could sit and do your thing. 

I have no bad thing to comment for this hotel. Service was great, food was nice and everything else was very satisfactory. I believe this is great place for kids, so I am going to use this hotel again for the family renunion next year.",5,2009/12/11
2,REDACTED,en,4267,"I am very excited about our first trip to Japan. It is a transit to Canada but we decided to stop over at Tokyo for 10 days instead of a direct flight of 23hours to Vancouver from KL. 

Been planning for this trip since August 09 and read a lot of review about hotels in Tokyo. I decided to stay in Westin Tokyo was because of the reply from the Management of Westin Tokyo in Trip Advisor. They really take effort to response to the reviewers in Trip Advisor, i am very impressed, eventhough i have yet to stay in the hotel (i booked from 20th to 23rd Dec), but i can imagine how excellent it can be.

I've yet to see another hotel who reply to the reviewers in Trip advisor, this really show how serious Westin Tokyo cares about their customers. Because of this, i also booked Westin hotel in Vancouver for our entire stay there.

Really excited and looking forward to stay in both Westin Tokyo and Westin Vancouver to celebration our Wedding anniversary as well as son's birthday.

2,REDACTED,en,4268,"My parents are about to check out of the Westin Tokyo after a two-week stay; after spending a lot of time with them there myself, our overall impression is one of disappointment at the level of customer service. There are two problems which the Westin needs to address:
1) Poor front desk service / communication ability
2) Inability of guests staying at the hotel (and paying a rather significant price for their rooms) to get a reservation at in-house restaurants.

After numerous encounters, our experience was that the front desk staff generally lacked the ability to communicate in English. It was frustrating for my non-Japanese speaking parents to not be able to be understood and have their needs met, especially after having spent time in this Westin and many other Starwood properties over the years. They got the impression that the front desk staff were not interested in them or their needs - their focus seemed to be on efficiency over quality. 

Perhaps the biggest issue they faced was the inability to get a table at the hotel restaurants. The Westin is a popular destination for diners in Tokyo, and the restaurants are generally fully booked in the evenings. For an elderly couple who cannot easily go elsewhere, this was extremely frustrating. Why the Westin does not reserve several tables for hotel guests is no mystery - they want to fill up their tables on a first-come first-served basis - but is inconvenient for people staying there who don't want to (or can't) go elsewhere.

We did manage to visit most of the restaurants despite the above problem; unfortunately the experience was not always up to our expectations:
- The Lounge: The only restaurant with an open table at the time; food was terrible
- Ryutenmon: overall excellent service, food and ambience. Very difficult to get a reservation here.
- Mai: Great service, food was very good
- The Terrace: crowded, ok service (some servers cannot communicate in English), made several mistakes on our bill. However, food is good and served quickly
- Victor's: The only restaurant with an open table at the time; overpriced, food was disappointing (the night my parents went, the menu was limited to ""Hungarian, Bohemian, Austrian Esterhazy"" items such as sausages, cabbage and wiener schnitzel, which was certainly not what they expected or wanted). However, it offers a spectacular view of Tokyo to distract you from the mediocrity of the cuisine.

On the positive side:
Room was fine - spacious, clean, and with good amenities.
Concierge was friendly and helpful
Porters were helpful and frequently asked if we needed anything

To summarize, this Westin property does not offer the level of service which one might expect of a property with the kind of reputation it enjoys. However, if you speak Japanese and are happy to eat elsewhere, you will probably be satisfied.",3,2009/11/29
2,REDACTED,en,4269,"As a regular traveller particularly in Asia I have never stayed in a Westin Hotel before and this maybe because I know little about the brand and have never considered them to be a luxury hotel group. I can say this was my first experience of the brand and most likely my last. 

On arrival, it was very much a sign here and swipe credit card affair, no explanation about the hotel its facillities or any information offered, quite unwelcoming. 

The lobby was very nicely decorated with Christmas decorations. 

The room was spacious as was the bathroom and I have to say extremely clean and I am very particular in regards to cleanliness so the hotel must have an excellent housekeeper. When I looked at the hotel website prior to arrival it mentioned ""Heavenly Beds"" so I assumed they would be rather like the wonderful beds that you get in Shangri La's or Four Seasons, alas they were not and looked as though they were quite a few years old and in need of replacement. The furnishings in the room were well maintained but old and very dated. I was most disappointed at arriving back late after dinner to find that there had not been a turn down service. When I called Reception about this I was told that I should have requested it. Again on the hotel website it mentions turn down service. At rack rate I would have expected it to be automatic.

I called down a couple of times to ask for fresh milk for my early morning tea as I don't like the dried milk in the room and the first response was yes but you have to pay for it, not certainly let me arrange that for you.

I found it quite irratating that when I went for coffee or afternoon tea in the lounge that all the window seats had been reserved so I was not able to sit in them, I would have had my coffee or afternoon tea and left yet still the window seats were vacant.

It was very much pot luck as to what the service was like in the restuarant. If the staff understood English you would get what you ordered if not you didn't. Overall very poor service in the Restaurant. We were going to book dinner but decided against it and went to the Oak Door which was excellent!

I got the impression that if you looked as though you were there on business you got very good service, if you looked like a tourist no one could be bothered.

The service I got in other hotels in Japan was outstanding and the staff so friendly and helpfull. Overall disappointing and on my next visit I will stay in an alternative hotel.",3,2009/11/22
2,REDACTED,en,4270,"Just got back from a 2-night stay at the Westin Tokyo. When you hear ""Westin,"" certain things come to mind--comfortable (but not necessarily luxurious) room, upmarket hotel, good service. All of these, and more, were true about the Westin Tokyo.

We were in a room on the 13th floor with a spectacular view of Tokyo Tower and the skyscrapers of Tokyo. It was gorgeous! In all fairness though, unless you're on a lower floor, the view from any room in the hotel is going to be pretty good. Our room was pretty-well sized and was comparable in size to the standard Westin. However, by Tokyo standards, our standard room was huge. Lots of room to move around--plenty of closet and drawer space. It came with a desk and chair, a lounging chair and a sitting table with a mirror. The bathroom was pretty well-sized too, except the shower did make me feel a little claustrophobic as the all-glass enclosure was a bit cramped. Bathroom also has a high-tech toilet/bidet, too.

We had two twin beds. Warning: the twin beds are not Heavenly beds. They were still pillow-top mattresses and were still comfortable though.

Service was top-notch. The man at check-in was not overtly warm, but that seems typical of Tokyo. Very professional and efficient. Concierge was very helpful with recommendations, but beware of the cultural differences between the West and Japan. It seemed the Japanese never wanted to contradict you--so, if you asked the concierge if XYZ was a good restaurant, you would receive a response that XYZ was a satisfactory restaurant. However, probing further would elicit more detailed answers and probably a better recommendation for a restaurant. 

Our price, including tax, was about $300 a night. For what we got, and the quality of the hotel, we were not displeased. Our rate also included free in-room Internet, too. Don't get coffee at the hotel restaurant--it was $5 for a plain cup of coffee. Instead, walk to Starbuck's across the street in Yebisu Palace Gardens. 

A couple of minor nit-picks about the Westin Tokyo though. First, this hotel is over-the-top decorated in European-style flair. There is black and red marble everywhere, from the floors to the stairs to the molding around the elevators. That struck me as kind of odd for Tokyo. I felt like I was in a hotel in Paris. I guess I expected a more traditional Japanese design. 

Second, the Westin Tokyo is a tad bit far from mass transit options. Getting to the Metro station involved a hike across a street, through Yebisu Palace Gardens (a mall with Mitsukoshi Department Store, Starbucks and McDonalds!), across another street, through a rather-humid-and-hot window-lined corridor on 5 or 6 long moving walkways, through the Arte mall, and down a long escalator. The first day--no problem. By the third day, we started dreading the long hike. All in all, it takes about 10 minutes. But, once you get to the Metro, the Ebisu station is relatively convenient to get you to all the top attractions in Tokyo with one or two connections.

A couple of tips we picked up for Tokyo. First, when you land at Narita, go downstairs to the basement of your terminal and look for the Travel Service Center. Buy a Narita Express/Suica card. This gets you a one-way Narita Express ticket into Tokyo along with a Suica card (which is used for Metro and JR Railways). It was about $32. It's a much better deal than just buying a Narita Express ticket (about $35 alone) and then buying Metro passes in Tokyo. Plus, the Suica card (which comes with about $15 in prepaid Metro tickets) lets you touch the card to the Metro fare gets and you pass right through.

Second, when you go to Tsukiji Fish Market (everyone goes there to see the fish and eat sushi!), everyone says to go to Sushi Dai or Sushi Daiwa. Both are located in Building 6. When we were there this past weekend, each had a 3-hour wait. With our limited time, we did not have 3 hours to spare to wait for sushi. There's another little non-descript, hole-in-the-wall place in the next building over. It's called Ben-Tomi Sushi. Third restaurant from the end. The only way you'll see it is by looking at the ground for a red-colored mat with Ben-Tomi Sushi written on it. Here's the rub--it serves the same fresh, amazing sushi everyone else serves. But, it's a lot more expensive. We each had about 7 pieces of sushi (tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail, scallop). It was $65 in total. If you're short on time, want great sushi, and are willing to pay more, head over to Ben-Tomi Sushi.",4,2009/11/11
2,REDACTED,en,4271,"We came to Tokyo for a long weekend so we wanted a comfortable place with reliable service - the Westin met our expectations. The decor was not to our taste but by Japanese standards, it can be considered luxury. There is a fantastic restaurant close to the hotel, famous for it's pork katsu. I think concierge will know the name. The walk to Ebisu station is still about 10mins (not as close as I was expecting) so allow for extra time but the metro/train was very easy to use. We highly, highly recommend taking a private tour of the fish markets (at 4am) - run by a local guy who used to work at the markets with impeccable English (you can google tsukiji nakamura and it will bring up his website). He also takes you to an incredible sushi place at the markets for breakfast, after the tour, if you want. Again, highly recommended. The hotel is also conveniently located very close to the 3 star Michelin Robouchon restaurant (which was handy for our very long lazy lunch). If you want a hotel with an active nightlife, then this is not the place. For a more tranquil, peaceful stay, then book the Westin.",4,2009/11/07
2,REDACTED,en,4272,"My husband and I traveled to Tokyo to visit our son who is studying at the Kanda University in Makuhari. Although our son speaks Japanese, we don't, so we wanted to stay at a hotel where the language wouldn't be a problem and the Westin was a perfect choice.

We took the Airport Limousine Bus from Narita to the hotel-- very convenient! The ticket counter is located directly across from you as you exit customs, so even if you are exhausted (we were!) and don't speak Japanese, you can find it easily. Cost is approximately $30 per person and the ride is about an hour and a half. Make sure you purchase your return tickets in advance at the hotel-- they'll even let you add it to your hotel bill. :-)

You can access the JR Ebisu train station on the Yamanote line by connecting corridors from the Westin (level B1) through the Yebisu Garden Place (upscale mall/business towers). Signs are clearly posted and there are moving walkways to speed you through. You can also access the Hibiya line of the metro/subway-- again, follow the signs.

Our room was lovely-- quite large. King-size bed, ladies vanity, business desk, dresser with flat screen tv and dvd player, sitting area (small loveseat, coffee table, and an armchair), and a bar area including coffee and tea service. A nice touch was the complimentary bottled water-- some hotels charge $5 for a bottle of water. Geez!

The hotel staff did an excellent job: the maid service was perfect, the front desk was efficient, and the concierge was very helpful-- particularly in recommending places for dinner. Our favorite was Bikkuri for sushi (we ate there three times!). The sushi was fabulous, and the prices were extremely reasonable. It's also located very near the Ebisu train station, just a quick walk from the hotel.

All in all, we had a wonderful experience at the Westin and I highly recommend it.",5,2009/10/26
2,REDACTED,en,4273,"I was a little nervous about my first trip to Japan because I do not speak the language so I picked a western chain. I am so glad I picked the Westin Tokyo! The hotel was elegant and immaculate. Every hotel staff person knew fantastic English and the concierge desk was phenomenal. They had the best maps, better than any of my 3 tour books. They gave us great directions, phoned in restaurant reservations for us, etc. Whenever in doubt, that concierge desk always was there to help. We paid an extra $30 US a night to be on concierge level, but it was so worth it because we got free internet, free cocktail hour every night and free breakfast buffet every morning (you could choose to eat in Executive club or in lobby restaurant). We ate in pretty lobby restaurant where by 2nd day, they remembered I was decaf and my husband liked regular coffee. When you would leave in the morning and come back tired at night, every and I mean every employee would smile and say hello. This was very warm and comforting to me being so far away from home. The location was awesome, just one train stop from Shibuya and two stops from Shinjinku. I liked that we were close to the action, but that our hotel was in a very quiet area. It was a nice retreat after dealing with Tokyo hustle and bustle all day sightseeing. Glad that it was so peaceful around our hotel. If the prices stay around where they are now, I will almost certainly stay at this hotel when I return.",5,2009/10/23
2,REDACTED,en,4274,"My husband and I just returned from a long weekend in Tokyo. We stayed at the Westin Tokyo hotel and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Being frequent travellers and SPG members, we have seen our fair share of Westins and this one is beautiful. The lobby is lovely, the staff fantastic. The rooms were well appointed, we were upgraded to a ""view room,"" and while still very nice, you could see that in a few more years the bathrooms will need to be redone. The style is Japanese ornate, not Japenese chic. 
We had access to the club lounge which was one of the best we have seen and would highly recommend upgrading to it. Full hot american and japanese breakfast, and appetizers and drinks throughout the day and evening. The hotel had many restaurants, one which is 1 Michlen star rated and quite delicious.

The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful. We used the conceirge everyday and ended up with some great restaurant, museum, and sightseeing recommendations.

The area around the hotel is very nice, however it is about a 10 minute walk to the JR line and 15 to the Tokyo Subway. The walk is not too bad as you use the people movers most of the time, however doing it a few times a day can get quick tiring especially after sightseeing. On the flip side, it is nice to come back to a ""quiet"" area after being in the hustle and bustle all day.
The local restaurants around the hotel were amazing. Great sushi, soba noodles, and ramen. 
The only negative would be the cost of drinks in the bar, they are very expensive, over 2100 Yen for a glass of wine... Still worth it once as the presentation is beautiful.",4,2009/09/26
2,REDACTED,en,4275,"The Westin Tokyo is an excellent hotel. The rooms were large and comfortable and had every amenity needed. The lobby is elegant and the staff is friendly. You can take the elevator to the ground floor and you have entered Ebisu Garden Place. Ebisu Garden Place has several good restaurants and plenty of shopping. Be sure to visit the Yebisu Beer Museum. It is free and you can buy a beer sampler at the end.

The TV in the hotel included five channels that were at least partially broadcast in English. Watching the Japanese channels was fun also. The hotel also had English newspapers available each day. They were only a few pages and covered the headlines.

You can easily walk to the Ebisu rail/subway station from the hotel. The entire walk is covered and most of the journey includes moving sidewalks. From the airport I would recommend taking the Airport Limosine, which is Orange large nice clean city-style bus. The cost was about $30, which is about the same as the subway. The easy part about the limosine is they put the luggage underneath.

My only complaint has to do with tax and tips. In Japan tax and tips is included in the price of everything. However, this does not apply at the Westin Tokyo. When we checked out they added a 10% gratuity service charge and some taxes. This added another $40 a night to our $245 room charge. We also skipped using the internet since the hotel was going to add a hefty daily charge for its use. The internet should be free in ALL luxury hotels.

Overall we had a great time and felt we made and very good hotel choice.",4,2009/09/19
2,REDACTED,en,4276,"After a stay at the Westin in Jan of this year, I've decided to go back on my next business trip in October (third time at this hotel)

While the hotel is slightly away from our office, it's a nice retreat to come back to, and certainly helps make a relaxing weekend. I'll post a review while I'm there.",5,2009/09/15
2,REDACTED,en,4277,"Stayed 4 nites with family. While the design of the hotel is not my preferred style, it kind of grew on me over the days. A few general comments are that the hotel is very well maintained. 

Location: I actually prefer this location. While there is a short walk to the metro and the JR Rail, it is all covered and you can use a moving walkway. The area around the hotel is a very calm and upscale residential area which was a very nice way to end the day. Yet it is still convenient to travel around. May be different if you are in Tokyo for business.

Rooms: Are large by Tokyo standards. We had a standard corner room on the executive club floor. King heavenly bed, which is very firm by NA standards. Excellent bathroom, reasonable layout. Very efficient housekeeping. Only thing I noticed is that the carpet appears to be a bit older in the rooms. The condition of the hotel is such that I could not really tell if the hotel was recently renovated or was just very well maintained.

Service: The level of service was excellent throughout. For part of our stay over the weekend, the hotel was completely full, but the level of service was still great.

Food: Can only comment on the breakfast at the terrace restaurant. It was very high quality and varied. The croissants were some of the best ever. We did consider dinner at the japanese restaurant one day, but never made it back to the hotel in time (and the prices were high, even by Tokyo standards).

Club Lounge: Decent sized room but given the number of executive club floors, i could see that the lounge could get very busy during the mornings. While I did not have breakfast at the club lounge, the quality of food offering was very good. Free wifi at the lounge.

Fitness Centre: Small but well equipped gym. All the cardio equipment is new and very well maintained. You can obtained discounted access to the nearby Ebisu Club if you wanted a larger rec facility with pool. Gym is 24 hours.

Recommendations: Absolutely, I love the hustle and bustle of Tokyo, but it was a real nice treat to retire to a very quiet area. I will almost certainly stay at this hotel when I return so long as the rates are reasonable (by Tokyo standards).",5,2009/09/09
2,REDACTED,en,4278,"This hotel is located in Ebisu, a few subways stops from Shinjuku, a beautifully landscaped area built around the headquarters of Sapporo breweries. The Ebisu subway/train station is attached to a high end shopping mall and there is a skywalk that will take you to the Ebisu gardens and the Westin hotel.

I have stayed at many Westin hotels, but I received the best service ever at this location. While waiting to check in, I was offered iced white tea. The staff were courteous and helpful and the rooms were extremely spacious, even by American standards. The bathroom was huge, and for the ladies, they had a dressing table with a lighted make up mirror in the main area of the room, which was a nice touch. I looked forward to coming back to relax at hotel each night after a long day of sightseeing. 

I did not eat at the hotel, as there were many options in the shopping mall across the street. There were great bakeries, japanese delis, grocery stores and many restaurants. On rainy days, you can take the underground walkway from the hotel through to the mall and subway/train station.

The hotel is a little pricey, but definitely worth the splurge.",5,2009/09/07
2,REDACTED,en,4279,"The hotel has an old world style with lots of dark wood and gold. The room was awesome with a full business desk equipped with everything we could possibly need. The selling point for me was the vanity desk. :) It's conveniently located in a mall that connects to the subway station. And it also provides an airport shuttle, which when we inquired about the night before, the concierge neglected to inform us that we needed to reserve & buy tickets in advance. I felt like the hotel dropped the ball a bit there. But the agent at the check-in desk was very helpful when we checked out and helped us to buy tickets.",5,2009/08/27
2,REDACTED,en,4280,"Spent six nights - two adjoining rooms - in the Westin Tokyo. Just fantastic. Beautiful, spaceous rooms with all the amenities you could ever want. Don't listen to those complaining about location - very convenient to the JR lines (even with whining kids in tow). Very quick access to Shinjuki, Shibuya, Disney, connecting trains to Kyoto, and Akihabara (hope my spelling is correct). Adjacent Ebisu is wonderful with a beautiful department store with excellent food and high end wines for sale. Food in the hotel (a bit pricey, but not by Tokyo standards) was excellent. Excellent multilingual concierge and staff.
Would definitely stay there again. Was not ""out of the way"" at all.
The lobby is stunning (even nicer than the Peninsula in Hong Kong, where we completed our Asian Vacation. Put the Westin at the top or your list.",5,2009/08/14
2,REDACTED,en,4281,"Our family stayed here in 2 rooms that were identical. The rooms were clean and larger than the average room. We stayed in 11 different hotels/ryokans on our trip to Japan and we ranked this hotel somewhere in the middle. Although people say it is a fancy hotel, our family was not really into the columns and room decor. That was probably the only thing we didn't like. The rooms were comfortable, quiet and had plenty of amenities.

The staff was extremely helpful. We were loaned umbrellas and given help locating hard to find items that we were shopping for.

The walk to the train wasn't bad if you didn't have your luggage, but coming and going with luggage was a long. hot walk.

The mall area out in front of the hotel had a McDonalds and 2 pastry shops. If you walk straight out toward the mall and pass the McDonalds on the left, continue walking and straight ahead toward the right is a really great pastry shop. We ate at all of them and really enjoyed that one most of all.

We never ate at the hotel. There were plenty of places within walking distance. And, don't worry about there not being things to do near the hotel. There is shopping and the train station is not far. Otherwise, you can enjoy the quiet area outside the hotel and watch the locals carry on their daily lives. The school children that walk by are so cute in matching uniforms and backpacks.

I won't post any pictures because our room looked exactly like the ones that other people have posted.",4,2009/08/10
2,REDACTED,en,4282,"Managed after 4 years finally to stay at the Westin Tokyo again this time part of a short time business trip. It is still the same great hotel as before. Very generously sized rooms and bathrooms in comparison to most of the other business hotels such as Hilton Tokyo, a heavenly bed and a great service as before.

Prices have come down a bit since my last stay - I stayed on the executive floor, but have to say here that the food offering (spreads) in the evening were a bit disappointing, here some improvement could be done - breakfast is as good as ever

Internet access in the rooms on the executive floor is still chargeable at Y 900 a day although this presents already a 50% discount. I personally feel that on the executive floor rooms internet access should be complimentary.


But still a wonderful location, hope now to stay more often there as my company now also has a corporate rate with the Westion",5,2009/07/29
2,REDACTED,en,4283,"This hotel is one of the best. They have a great interior, with equally nicely appointed rooms. Staff is quite attentive and goes the extra mile for you. Rates are good for Tokyo.. The hotel has covered walkways to the Tokyo Subway which is very nice when raining as it often does. This hotel is also a stop on the Narita Airport limo line, so transport from Narita is easier.",5,2009/07/25
2,REDACTED,en,4284,"We stayed 1 week at the Westin Tokyo. Hesitant at first because our typical choice in hotels for Tokyo are in Ginza, Shinjuku, or Shibuya.... the more busy and more convenient areas. However, due to an unbelievable good corporate rate offered, we couldn't pass it up. Glad we didn't. The Yebisu area that this hotel is in is absolutely beautiful, relaxing, and really nice to get back to after a hectic and exhausting day.

There is a long walk from JR station to the hotel. There are moving walkways along, and you don't even get wet if it rains, because there is a covered walkway all the way connected to the B1 level of the hotel. You just have to walk walk walk and get to JR station of Yebisu.

Tons of dining options across in Yebisu Garden place, top of the Yebisu Garden Place are restaurants that are very good, and beautiful views of Tokyo. We also liked having access to Starbucks, McDonalds, convenience stores, pharmacy, La Boutique Joel Robauchon (bread and pastries), and Mitsukoshi department store, and a nice small food court level with an excellent Ramen restaurant that is a must try. 

The hotel's location now discussed, we move on..... the lobby is stunning. We got a room on the 12th floor, Deluxe room faces the Tokyo tower.
Everything in the room was immaculately cleaned. What amazed and impressed me is there is not ONE single stain or rust or crack or wear and tear in the room, this hotel is 17 years old, not newly renovated, but it is in top notch shape. I am very picky and fussy about these things. I examined every inch of the room and bathroom, impressive. The vents of the air conditioning was completely spotless, the sinks, taps, toilets, corners of the room, tables, desks, the beds, the linens, pillows... etc. Spotless. Very impressive.

The service was absolutely wonderful. Each staff would stop and bow and greet us every time we passed by. Elevators are quick, and always spotless as well. Concierge was brilliant. Arranged for our rental car to be delivered to the hotel upon our check out, got us maps, ensured we knew how to walk and get to restaurants we wanted to go to, arranged Takkyubin for our luggage to be forwarded to our next hotel without any hassle to us or bothered us. All was handled swiftly and efficiently.

Staff spoke excellent english.

The buffet breakfast at this hotel is one of the best we have had. It's a must try. Freshly squeezed juice offered, tons of pastries, bread, and omlette station, and lots of fruits, salads, cereals, sausages, fish.....and most beautiful of all was the Japanese breakfast buffet items. Loved it every morning.

The ONLY thing guests may complain about is they charge 1800 yen a day for internet in the room. And, the toilet is NOT the typical electronic advanced ones you get usually in hotels nowadays.

There is a room safe, and ironing board, and iron, and a nice flat screen huge TV, a desk, and the most comfortable ""heavenly"" bed with lots of fluffy pillows.

Size of room was good, not huge, but bigger than many hotel rooms in Tokyo.

For our price per night, we had a super deal. Whether this hotel is worth its money depends how much you get per night, but not looking at the price per night, this is a beautiful hotel no matter what.

From the Narita airport, we took the airport limousine bus, it took 1 hour 45 minutes with no traffic jam. It is a long way and it is the last stop of the airport limousine bus of this route. But it's convenient if you have lots of luggage and don't want the hassle of getting a taxi from Shinagawa JR or Tokyo station.",5,2009/07/20
2,REDACTED,en,4285,"I really liked this hotel. The staff was incredibly friendly and warm and the rooms were very nice. I felt totally at ease here. The restaurant at the top of the hotel was wonderful - that was one of the best meals from our trip. When the porter brought our bags to the room he bowed, and then I bowed, and then he bowed again and it was exactly like a 1950s sitcom. A really hilarous way to start the trip!

It was a bit far away from the train - about a 15 minute walk. If you want to be in the middle of everything this is not the hotel for you. 

Room service was great, the concierge was great, I loved the big tub in the bathroom and the soft, comfy bed. The hotel was very quiet so I think this would be a nice place for couples. When I return to Tokyo, I will definitely stay here again.",5,2009/07/09
2,REDACTED,en,4286,"We stayed 3 nights with cash and points and had a marvelous stay. This was far and away the nicest hotel we have ever stayed at.
The lobby and common areas of the Westin are stunning. Black marble and gold trim throughout, several lovely lobby bars, restaurants, and sitting areas. We just ate breakfast pastries a few times and they were excellent - did not otherwise sample the food.
The room was a good size, bigger than I expected for Tokyo, and extremely quiet with good lightproofing when the blinds were drawn. From the 7th floor, no view to speak of. The bed was typical Westin Heavenly bed and is great, a full-size king. The room is luxuriously decorated and furnished. The bathroom has separate tub and shower, again decorated in black (marble?) tiles and chrome trim. The toiletries are excellent quality and there is a complete shaving kit and other personal amenities in the room. There are two fluffy terry robes and Japanese style robes for your use during your stay. Some examples of the attention to detail: the shower head has an infinite height adjustment; the flat-screen TV is set on a pivoting base and viewable from anywhere in the room (BBC, CNBC, CNN availabile in English); our daughter's crib was housekept as well as the rest of the room and her crib was even given its own welcome mat.
Our daughter was given a small welcome kit on arrival, which included a night light, a rubber ducky for the bathtub, and wall outlet plugs for safety.
We didn't use room service or make any unusual requests, but the service (in the lobby, etc) was exceptional; attentive and professional, with English widely spoken. Very friendly but not intrusive, although they absolutely insisted on helping me with my bags.

The only drawback to this room is that the location is a bit far from Ebisu station - about 15 minutes, even with the moving walkways. And the area surrounding it is a bit dead at night - there are restaurants, but no old-fashioned, hole-in-the-wall types that I usually go for.

Again, nicest hotel we have ever stayed at, bar none. A great experience.",5,2009/07/08
2,REDACTED,en,4287,"Stayed using my points for five days. Great hotel after dealing with the crowds all day. If you want to try the local restaurants, make a right after exiting the hotel and hit the local ramen place and other restaurants down the hill! Make sure you try the breakfast buffet and immediately go for their baked goods made by their French baker or better yet ask for the breakfast package. I can't believe you have to pay for internet access.",4,2009/07/03

Would DEFINELY go again if i ever make it back to Tokyo.",5,2009/07/01

Was offered all the perks as a Gold member (we weren't last time we stayed here). Very upscale, but child friendly. Unlike our last stay, noise was never a problem this time. FYI, You can rent a bike from their concierge for around 4000 yen, then get lost in the neighborhood. I found so many great little pastry shops, restaurants, and vintage furniture shops bicycling throughout the neighborhood. You'll feel like a local.",5,2009/06/26
2,REDACTED,en,4290,"I was in Tokyo on the 19th and 20th of June and chose this hotel because the location and price were good relative to the quality of rooms and service. On both fronts the hotel met or exceeded my expectations. The room was comfortable and very quiet. I am not crazy about the faux classical styling (sort of like a nice hotel in Vegas only without the casino), but that's just personal taste and it is nice. I had a little difficulty getting the room as cool as I would like. The food in the hotel is generally excellent, especially the breakfast buffet (in my experience it is the best in Tokyo). I did not try the restaurants since they are so expensive (dinner at the teppanyaki place starts at $250 per person and goes up from there). The real stand out at this hotel, however, is service. I asked the hotel services manager for advice relating to the funeral I needed to attend, and was blown away by the thoughtful, attentive assistance I received, with follow-up on matters that I had not even considered asking about. Everyone I asked for assistance spoke good English and was very helpful. Beyond that, the location is good but not great. The hotel is a pretty long walk from Ebisu station, but a lot of that is via a moving walkway so it goes fast. There were not as many neighborhood restaurants as I would have expected. But it is easy to get around from there - overall a lot more convenient than someplace like the Park Hyatt, which is in a complete dead zone. I got a good running map from the front desk, and found the hotel gym to be very good. I did not go to the swimming pool, which is in a separate building and requires an extra charge. Overall, I would return for business or pleasure.",5,2009/06/25

Hotel lobby look very nice like in the most luxorious hotels and you have a shopping center and a few good restaurants just across the street...
Only problem for me would be the price for this hotel which was around 270 USD per night. I had everthing payed by my office, but I stayed in better hotels all over the world for much less money. Japan is expensive if you don't try to make your trip cheaper. And there is a way...definetely...

Full breakfast served at the Business lounge and main hotel restaurant. Best buffet breakfast I ever had in a hotel! International grocery store at Mitsukoshi (mall next door). Several good restaurants within walking distance. Highly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure.,5,2009/06/10
2,REDACTED,en,4293,"Stayed in the Westin, Tokyo for 4 weeks last year. An amazing hotel which is fairly obviously one of the higher end hotels in Tokyo. Lamborghinis & Ferraris lined the car park, the hotel was a wedding venue every weekend.. 

It is a very nice, very high standard hotel. After 4 weeks we moved to a 4 star hotel 3-4 blocks away and paid less than half the rates for something that was almost as good. When you are paying £200-300 per night, I don't expect to be charged to use the pool.

In summary, great place if you don't care about the money, if you do; spend a lot less at a good 4 star.",3,2009/05/26
2,REDACTED,en,4294,"Booked the Westin with starwoods points and cash which is a great option, but also why I did not look at any other hotels in Tokyo. Glad I did not...the value, through SPG is great (though it was just reclassified as a Category 6 hotel, so its more pricey now)... The staff is amazing, very helpful, the rooms are massive, by any standard and the location is perfect. It is one of the stops on the Limo Bus shuttle from Narita, which I highly recommend (about $30 per person) and takes 1 and a half hours from NRT. We loved the location because it is close to the Ebisu stop on the Yamanote line and close to the Hibiya line stop. So, within 2 lines and 20 minutes, you can get almost anywhere you need to go in Tokyo. Also, the walk to the subway is quick and delightful, as you can stroll through the Yebisu garden palace, which is a great shopping area. I could write a whole other review on the garden palace, but the pastry shops outside are great and you must check out the food market on the bottom floor, it is the most insane food shopping experience I have ever seen. You also have the Sapporo factory across from the hotel, which is worth the 10 minute tour and cheap beer at the end.

I saw some people complain about the walk with their bags from the subway to the hotel...I can see that being a little annoying, but with people movers it is easy and if you are coming from the airport, you should not be taking the train anyways, the bus is cheap and quick.

The Westin is perfect...great as a base to travel around the city and nice to come home to at night for a relaxing stay.",5,2009/05/18
2,REDACTED,en,4295,"I'm a bit of a fan of Westin's around the world, i think it's Starwood's greatest attribute. i'm not a liker of properties that were once something else magically becoming a Westin as for me it's a stand alone.

The Tokyo property set in Ebisu, is cracking and a hive of activity, and such a beautiful hotel, even if while i was there we had a minor earth quake!

Concierge were great, and there was always a line of waiting taxis, it's extremely safe, and it is a testament to their management, that there is never a waiting period. the problem with Tokyo in general is it's not so close proximity to the Airport, so this would be the only transport issue, however you get to see Chiba etc going too and from, which is nice, but over an our of Airport Transfer to Nerita is a right pain.

Now i was upgraded to the SPG floor - member for life, and was completely taken back, view, size, bed, facilities, everything was incredible. No free internet which is always a gripe for me, but the comfort of the room was incredible, i had some dry cleaning done, and it was incredibly immaculate on it's return.

I have only two gripes, and one was price (that said I was there over an exhibition peak period, but honestly almost 40,000 yen is really too much to pay per night for a Hotel, which is around $365, and this was without breakfast. I heard from other guests that the Breakfast was amazing, however, it was a bit of sushi on the run for me, travelling to the Big Shot Tokyo Exhibition centre each day.

The othe gripe was the fact that because of my tattoos i wasn't allowed to use the stunning pool facilities, apparently because that it a bit 'Yakuza' which was a bit of a problem for me, as I mean in Europe it's remove everything, even underpants, and in Japan - given more conservative, but i mean Tattoo's are freedom of choice. But I digress, it's not a big deal.

The location is smashing, and i really love this Ebisu region, close to Harijuko and the city station, and the people generally very friendly. I had one small incident, where I called the Westin Cho Sun - Seoul for my connecting hotel reservation, and this was charged to my account, i did mention that i was calling the same chain to make sure my reservation was in order, however, it didn't hold.

The business centre guys were a bit vague, when i tried to book tickets to 'Wicked' the musical. In the end i opted to find the theatre myself and jumped in a cab. It was incredible, and i definately recommend it, even if you don't speak japanese. but i evidently wished that the business centre people were a bit more organised with what's happening in the most 'happening' city in the world.

i definately recommend this hotel, it is magical, and the rooms and location are it's best asset. I'd definately stay there again, price pending!",5,2009/05/10
2,REDACTED,en,4296,"We stayed at the Westin Tokyo twice on our recent trip to Japan for a total of 5 nights. Both times we had great rooms, great views, and great service. The location is good, a short walk to Ebisu Station through Yebisu Garden Place, which then allows you to get pretty much anywhere in Tokyo with a train or subway ride. There is also a Mitsukoshi Dept store right across the street, with a fabulous food court in the basement - great for sushi and bentos. Our concierge helped us out getting Ghibli Museum tickets, and very good directions on how to get there.",5,2009/05/01
2,REDACTED,en,4297,"I've stayed here twice and will stay again soon. It's one of my all-time favorite hotels. Everything says luxury. The lobby is gorgeous. The rooms are huge (for Tokyo). The staff is polite, helpful and speaks perfect English. The restaurants are phenomenal. It's not inexpensive but it's an incredible hotel. I've only been to Tokyo once when I stayed elsehwere and I'd much rather be here. The lounge on the 7th floor gives a great view of the city.",5,2009/04/26
2,REDACTED,en,4298,Rooms are more victorian style than the usual contemporary style. Very spacious for Japanese Hotel. 10 mins walk from Ebisu JR train line. A number of nice izakaya near the Ebisu train station. 2 stations away from Shibuya station,4,2009/02/22
2,REDACTED,en,4299,"First off, seems like everyone's been using Cash and Points. Well, I'm no different as that represents an exceptional value. 

As a SPG Platinum, I booked 2 rooms for 2 nights over Christmas. Yes, I couldn't believe I could get a booking let alone getting C&P. I received a corner room while the other party received an adjoining regular room. Front desk advised the Exec floors were full and I do believe them. 

For a long time, the Westin was considered the top hotel in Tokyo, until the Ritz opened up. However, I do have to admit it's pretty luxurious. It reminds me of converted palazzos (into hotels) in Europe with its use of marble everywhere.

My room was a very good size. No, it didn't have the ""Japanese"" toilet but I don't particularly care as it's not a novelty for me. However, the regular rooms do get this type of toilet. The rooms themselves were outfitted in high quality furnishings and I have zero complaints. The HVAC worked well and the ""do not disturb"" is activated by turning on a switch by the door - yes, just like the European luxe hotels.

As an unintended benefit, my 2nd room also received Plat benefits. The Exec lounge had all sort of pastries on Christmas day as well as a rather large Christmas cake. There's a large selection of drinks and you can ask the attendant for alcoholic drinks free of charge. There's a very good expresso machine, too. On the 2nd day, I did come into the lounge during the last 10 min of h'ors d'oeurves hour. Although the zoo of people virtually guaranteed there to be almost nothing left, what was left was pretty good. 

Service was top notch. It is as expected of Japan but also taken a notch higher. I actually can't remember when I received service from other hotels of this calibre, regardless of country or continent.

The location is good. As others have said, it's in Ebisu. NO, it's not a ""long walk"" from the train station to the hotel, unless you have a walking problem. The moving sidewalks make quick work of any distances you need to walk. I did eat at Atelier de Robuchon (the French chateau in front of the Westin) and it was decent. However, I prefer Enoteca Pinchiorri (Odaiba) more, but that's a different review. 

Tips: 
1) The office tower complex in Ebisu houses some surprises. On the ground floor, there's a 24 hour convenience store. Next to that, there's a shop that offers free internet access WITH a computer. 
2) In the same complex on the lower floor is a McDonald's, in case you're craving it. 
3) On the top 2 floors of the same complex are upscale restaurants that offer an excellent view of Tokyo. 
4) The exec lounge offers free wifi. You need to ask the attendant for the password. 
5) There is a DVD player in the room. Conveniently enough, you can rent videos from Tsutaya next door. Just go to the business centre and ask them to borrow a Tsutaya membership. It's that easy. 
6) As a Plat, I had free access to breakfast at either the Exec lounge or the ground floor restaurant. Take the ground floor restaurant for an unbelieve array of food and drink. I've already mentioned happy hour with h'ors d'oeurves in the Exec lounge.

Would I return? Without hesitation.",5,2009/02/01
2,REDACTED,en,4300,"I booked three rooms with Starwood Preferred Guest points. Each room was on a different sid of the hotel with the 14 and 10 year old getting the side with Mt Fuji views. On a couple of nice clear January days the view of the volcano were magic. It is my first time in 3 visits to Tokyo I had seen Fuji through the haze.

The location of the Westin is not in the tourist zone, but easy access to the train station made that irrelevant. The hotel restaurants were staggeringly expensive, but a nice italian restaurant was across the road. Fro the same money as at the hotel you could dine at Joel Rebuchon across the road. In the lower level of Joel Rebuchon and connected to the Westin is his branded patisserie which served the best french style baked goods I have had outside France. A good alternative to the expensive hotel breakfast buffet, but doesn't open until 9:30 and all take-away.

The staff at the Westin were very attentive and a pleasure to deal with.",5,2009/01/30
2,REDACTED,en,4301,"Like the previous reviewer, we also used cash and points on SPG to book our stay at the Westin Tokyo. With this deal, it cost us 90USD/night for a king-sized ""upgraded"" room, although I didn't really see what was upgraded about it, but I'll get to that later.

Although the address states ""Meguro,"" the hotel is really located in Ebisu, which has I believe 4 JR lines that run through it. The one line that we used frequently was the Yamanote Line (a light greenish color). This line circles the city and is very convenient. Our NEX train dropped us off at Shinjuku station, where we transferred to the Yamanote line to Ebisu station. The walk through the covered walkway was a bit long (approximately 10 minutes) but definitely bearable. You don't even have to exit the walkway building to get to the Westin; just follow the signs in the basement level which will lead you straight into the basement of the Westin.

The service is impeccable, as is with all establishments in Japan. They speak minimal English (and some even speak Chinese).

Our room was a king-sized room with a small seating area and a flat panel, wide screen TV and DVD player. Unlike the previous poster, we did not have a special ""Japanese"" toilet; I was really looking forward to this! We had a plain regular toilet that didn't have a seat warmer nor a bidet function. There is a separate shower and tub area, which really came in handy when my husband needed to soak his tired feet and I just wanted to shower.

The hotel is very clean and very impressive. There are many shops within the Ebisu Garden complex -- a McDonald's, a ramen noodle shop, a curry rice shop, a pharmacy/convenience store (Tomod's) and even a department store with a small supermarket in the lower level (Mitsukoshi).",4,2009/01/24
2,REDACTED,en,4302,"I'll start by saying we used the ""points and cash"" payment from SPG to get our room at the Westin which saved us a lot of money. We ended up with an upgraded room from the one king-size bedroom we had initially booked as they claimed that they were low on those particular rooms.

Location wise, the Westin was about a 7 min walk from the Ebisu JR station (10 min to Tokyo Metro station) if you used the Skywalk. It's great if you are planning to hang out around Shibuya, Roppongi and Shijuku. However, it's a good 30 min subway ride up to Asakusa/Ueno if you plan on venturing to the other side of the city.

The Yebisu Garden area where the hotel is located has a decent department store and lots of restaurants, including a Joel Robuchon just outside the hotel. If you don't feel like going out for expensive grub after a long day of going around Tokyo, just buy the cheap take-out food in the basement floor. That food is infinitely better than any mall food you can get in North America.

Like other Westins that I have stayed before, the room was clean and comfortable. After spending the previous 8 days of our trip in hostels and ryokans around Japan, the Heavenly Bed sure was comfortable. The bathroom was well equipped with a shower and bathtub, heated toilet seats and bathroom accessories (in case you forgot to bring them). There was a TV and DVD player in the room as well with a decent selection of channels and music stations.

I think what really stands out for this particular hotel was the service. The staff was very friendly and the service was excellent. Initially, when we got the room, there was a snafu with our reservation (this was after we had already got the deluxe room, by the way), but that was quickly cleared up. I was chatting with one of the hotel staff that it was our honeymoon in Tokyo and we had been travelling around Japan for more than a week. To our surprise, when we got back to the hotel that first night in the Westin, the hotel presented us with complimentary champagne to celebrate our trip. Very nice of them to do that.

Overall, if you don't mind the long walk to the subway stations, I highly recommend this hotel for its comfort and service.",5,2009/01/19
2,REDACTED,en,4303,"I have stayed at the westin on a number of occasions in the past.The price continues to climb , but I have nonetheless remained faithful to the place , and have recommended it to a number of friends. The service has always been by and large exceptional , and thoughtful smiling staff go along way to help you .E ven though I lived in tokyo for many years they can certainly smooth things out for the tired traveller. My big complaint which will cause me to rethink staying again , is the nickel and dime approach to services a 500 yen fee for the access to the computer ( bberry not working ) and a 300 yen charge for making a connection to a long distance provider , and a an almost 500 yen charge for making a local phone call? When you are staying on the executive floor paying premium rates you really dont expect this",2,2008/11/21
2,REDACTED,en,4304,"If you're visiting Tokyo for personal pleasure, another hotel would probably be a better choice. The Westin is pretty pricey, and the location is midway between two subway stops (Ebisu is the better stop.) Bathroom is large and spacious, but I hate how on top of a $350 room, they charge near $20 for Internet , when other Japanese business hotels will give you internet for free.

Pros: 2 American TV channels, large bathroom, Westin heavenly bed, good business concierge

Cons: Inconvenient location, price, no view",3,2008/11/08
2,REDACTED,en,4305,"Stayed at the Westin Tokyo for 3 nights in September. My husband and I were touring Japan and chose the Westin for our stay in Tokyo.

The positives: 
-BEAUTIFUL hotel, fantastic staff. Our room was HUGE and perfect. It was very clean. 
-The Ebisu area is fantastic. It's so new and modern. There are tons of restaurants and bars to explore.
-Quiet and out of the Tokyo hustle and bustle. It was a really peaceful part of the city.
-Ebisu is a great location on the subway line to see the city.. however... (see below)

The negative:
-The hotel was pretty far from the metro stop. Yes, they have moving walkways, and it is probably less than 15 minutes to the subway. BUT, mid-day, while we were touring around, we would have loved to come back to the hotel to freshen up before dinner. This seemed like a HUGE out-of-the-way task because of the hotel's distance from the metro.

Overall, I would recommend the hotel to people that were going to Tokyo for business, not really for touring. Unless you plan to leave in the morning and come back to go to bed, it's too much of a pain to hike back and forth from the hotel to the metro more than once.",4,2008/10/21
2,REDACTED,en,4306,A short walk on the Skyway from JR Ebisu station East Exit or a 3 minute taxi ride and you are transported to another world away from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. Thoughtful service that makes you smile and well furnished rooms ensure that you are relaxed. The award winning Executive Lounge is worth the extra as is the view.,5,2008/10/06
2,REDACTED,en,4307,"The room was 4 stars, the service was 5 stars. I went for a run in the morning and when I arrived back at the hotel, a bus ""person"" handed me cold bottled water upon my return. What can top that! The food was great for a buffet. Fresh grapefruit and orange juice hand squeezed for breakfast. Lunch included a good shrimp and scallops dish, grilled fish, and great green salads. All in all, a great business stay. It is a distance from NRT (what isn't) , but once you are there you can get to the main downtown areas in a short amount of time.",4,2008/09/18
2,REDACTED,en,4308,"The hotel service was outstanding, the food was a bit pricey but excellent and there are plenty of nearby restaurants within just a short 3 minute walk.

Room was very clean with comfortable bed and bathroom.

About a 10 minute walk to Ebisu station makes it fairly convenient - but I agree with the other reviews - this probably isn't easy with a lot of luggage (I never take more than a small knapsack and briefcase) so for me it wasn't an issue.

The best part of the hotel is the service. It doesn't get much better than this....Example: Caught in the rain one day - before I even reached the front door someone was handing me a clean dry towel...nice touch.

Would not hesitate to stay here again if I have business in this area of Tokyo.",5,2008/09/03
2,REDACTED,en,4309,"This is a typical Westin. Nothing much to remember, either positive or negative. the staff was professional staff and rooms were clean and well-appointed. The carpets seem jaded but were more than made up by the bath rooms which seem to have been refurbished recently. The restaurants were OK but pricey. 

For business travellers, this hotel is a little bit away from the Tokyo central area where most offices are. It takes about 40 minutes in peak hour by taxi. (Since taxi drivers don't understand English, don't forget to take those little chits with the hotel address in Japanese that they have at the concierge desk !!)",4,2008/07/28
2,REDACTED,en,4310,"I agree with the previous review, the Westin Tokyo is a great hotel once you get there. Ebisu is easily accessible by train, but the hotel is located on a hill ABOVE the train station. It is not that easy to reach the Westin when travelling with heavy bags or young children. Eebisu is a quiet neighborhood compared to Shinjuku or Ginza, yet you will find many dining options in the area.

The hotel is very nice. It has a really fancy deco - marble in many areas, columns (!) in the room, and gold accents. rooms are clean and well appointed. The hotel being located above the city, we had a view on the Mount Fuji from our room! Service is well above average, as expected in a Westin.

I recommend the hotel to travelers not afraid of walking! any party travelling with children, or elderly, should maybe pick a more central location.",4,2008/07/16
2,REDACTED,en,4311,"I travel to Tokyo a lot on business and as an elite SPG traveller wanted to try the Westin purely to earn points. It is a very classy hotel located in the Yebisu Garden district.

The hotel is done up in that Japanese styled European elegance that must have been popular during the bubble. Service is impeccable and the hotel has recently added a Westin workout facility that's top notch. Rooms are nice, typical of what you'd expect for a Westin, and decent size. Bathrooms are marble/granite in construction and nice seperate stall shower and tub. And of course the room features an exciting high tech Japanese toilet. 

The hotel features an executive lounge with cocktails in the evening and breakfast in the morning for frequent guests. Cocktails are generous with full bar and nice selection of appetizers. The breakfast is also generous and filled with amusing options such as green salad (for breakfast?). The Westin staff has learned a bit about western tastes since I was last at the property and are now serving crispy bacon alongside the limp traditional offering.

The Yebisu Garden complex provides a lot of dining options (so you're not limited to the $150 ""sushi sampler"" on the room service menu) as well as shopping and international ATM at a post office branch. I ate at a traditional tonkatsu location (Japanese fried pork that tastes a bit like weiner schnitzel) and at a yakiniku (Japanese style Korean BBQ) restaurant, but the options were varied and offered options in a variety of price ranges.

So...what's not to like? Unfortunately the one major drawback to the Westin is its location. The Ebisu subway station is a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel through the Yebisu Garden complex, and Ebisu is not necessarily close to traditional Tokyo business districts. Check into this consideration when booking your stay as at the end of a long business day or sightseeing venture this could be a drawback.",4,2008/06/24
2,REDACTED,en,4312,"Since years I stay at the Westin Hotel when in Tokyo. Okay, it's expensive and the rooms not furnished according to my taste - but in general it's a very oppulent hotel with good service. Don't miss the breakfast.",3,2008/06/23
2,REDACTED,en,4313,"My husband and I stayed at the Westin Tokyo for four nights in early June. This was our first time to Japan and we were not disappointed with the accomodations. 

From the minute we walked into the hotel, we were greeted enthusiastically. We were assisted with every request we had whether it be needing directions to a certain location in town or getting a restaurant recommendation. The concierege was pleasant and helpful. 

I was a little worried about the location in Tokyo but with how efficient the subways are we found it was just a few minute ride to any location we wanted to see. It was 2 stops to Roppongi Hills and about 5 stops to the fish market (about as far as you need to go in Tokyo). 

The hotel was classy, elegant and the room had fabulous features. The shower was wonderful, the bathroom was very modern and our bedroom had an area with a couch and chair. There were two options for breakfast-a buffet on the 1st floor which was excellent and a continental breakfast if you were an SPG preferred guest. Both were very nice for us. 

It will be a while until I get back to Japan as it's a far trip and there are a lot of places my husband and I want to see, but when I do go back, I will head directly to this hotel",5,2008/06/20
2,REDACTED,en,4314,I think this is one of the very best locations to be in. It is near the ebisu line and a mall that has many eateries. Thus although the hotel it self serves expensive food u are not limited to it although late into the night. The mall even has a macs and a supermarket. The rooms are great with the infamous westin bed!! gosh u can really enjoy a good sleep after all the shopping is done. there were simply no complains at all being there. everything was taken care off and the toilet was hahah like heaven. Toiletries are provided for. U can brew your own coffee as well!! Great Stay and Yes I will return again.,5,2007/12/17
2,REDACTED,en,4315,"Our stay at the Westin was uneventful and completely stress free. 

My spouse & I were arriving in Tokyo on separate flights landing in separate airpots and we were anxious about getting to the hotel in the middle of the night. But there was no need for us to worry, upon arrival at the hotel doors, our luggage was whisked away, check-in was fast and friendly and we are in our room in no time. Our room was on the top floor (21st) and we had panoramic view of Tokyo.

The room itself was western-styled and bigger than a standard Japanese hotel room. The bathroom was elegant without being ostentatious. And as expected, everything in the room was clean and in-order.

Service was top-class. Our calls to the service express office were promptly answered and the required service we wanted met. The business centre staff went out of their way and lent us their office computer to check emails when all the terminals were being used by other guests. The consierge was also very helpful in providing maps, timetables and other information.

The location of the hotel is less hectic than say Shinjuku or Shibuya, but the with the train & subway station less than a 10 minute walk away one can easily travel to other parts of the city. The area around the hotel also has a lot of interesting places to see, the Ebisu Garden Place is across the street, restaurants abound and there are a number of ""hip"" places/shops like the Tokyo store of Maison Martin Margiela.",5,2007/11/28
2,REDACTED,en,4316,"After returning from a six-night stay at the Tokyo Westin, I must say
that I am greatly suprised to re-read some of the negative comments on here regarding this hotel. Our experience at the Tokyo Westin was excellent.

We redeemed Starwood points for the six-night stay in a superior king-bedded room. Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly by all the staff in the motor coach area. Our bags were quickly whisked away and
we were led to the check-in desk by one of the staff. The transition from the airport shuttle bus to the check-in desk was seemless and handled very professionally. 

At check in, we were offered an upgrade to an Executive Floor room with breakfast and executive lounge privileges for 7000 yen a night (about $60 a night). (Since we are just Gold, we would not have received either of these otherwise). We figured it was worth it since
would eliminate the stress of finding a place to have breakfast every
morning. Plus, all those free drinks and appetizers do add up over the course of six days. We took the upgrade.

The room was very nice. We were in a corner king-bedded room on the 14th floor with a wonderful view of Shibuya, Shinjuku and Roppongi. As referenced in prior reviews, the decor is definitely more Western than Asian-influenced. However, the room was very tastefully decorated and the carpet, walls and furntiure were in excellent condition. The room had a separate sitting area with a couch, lounging chair, coffee table and cocktail table. Marble columns framed the sitting area. The bed was comfortable, but it is not your typical Westin Heavenly Bed. It is a bit firmer than those beds. There was also a makeup table and mirror adjacent to the bed. The bathroom had marble floors and accents. There was a separate shower and tub. The products were replenished daily and there is a kit with all sorts of items if you forget to bring some from home (e.g., toothbrush, toothpaste, etc).

Unlike other reports on here, we found the buffet breakfast to be perfectly acceptable and quite good. The breakfast selection includes: made to order eggs, scrambled eggs, oven-basked eggs, crispy and regular bacon, two different types of sausage links, potatoes (sometimes broiled, sometimes mashed), asparagus, rice, a daily chicken dish, a daily pasta dish, miso and other soups, all types of breads and pastries, pancakes, waffles, doughnuts, cereals, yogurt, and all kinds of Japanese breakfast items (including some sushi). There are all sorts of freshly squeezed juices, milk and excellent coffee. There is a bakery at the entrance to the restuarant
that makes amazing desserts. We tried several over the course of our stay and they were always very, very good. The service at the breakfast restaurant and at the bakery was top notch. Glasses were refilled regularly and without request. The entire staff was extremely friendly, attentive and bent over backwards to please us. 

We took advantage of the executive lounge on a daily basis. In addition to the drinks and snacks available throughout the day, there
is a daily happy hour from 5:30-7:30 p.m. There were 6-8 different types of appetizers set up daily. The selection varied from day to day, so there was no way to get bored. The drinks included soft drinks, juices, beer, wine and liquor. Once again, the staff at the executive lounge was extremely friendly and attentive. 

The common areas of the hotel are very well maintained. The lobby is gorgeous and there was no stench of smoke anywhere. 

As for the hotel's location, it is located in the neighborhood of Ebisu. For those of you that want the craziness and lights of Shinjuku or Shibuya, this is not your hotel. This hotel is a residential neighborhood and a bit secluded from the craziness of Tokyo nightlife. However, the Ebisu JR and subway stations are a brisk 5-minute walk from the hotel. There are even moving sidewalks to help you along the way. We found the location very convenient to moving around Tokyo on the JR and subway line, and it was quite nice to return to a quiet, more residential abode in the evenings after spending all day in the hussle of the city. Ebisu Garden Place is adjacent to the hotel and includes a Mitsukoshi department store, Beer Garden and Grill, Italian eaterie and other restuarants (Joel Robuchon is located in a beautiful mini-palace building), McDonald's and an office buiding that houses Morgan Stanley.

Overall, I must say that our experience at the Tokyo Westin ranks as one of the best we have had at any hotel worldwide. The service we received at the hotel from every staff member hotel-wide was top notch. I was actually very depressed to leave the Westin Tokyo and check into the Westin Osaka (but that is another review). We will definitely return to the Westin Tokyo when we are back in Tokyo, and we highly recommend it to others. We are truly shocked that this hotel is not rated higher on TripAdvisor.",5,2007/10/18
2,REDACTED,en,4317,"I went to China and Japan with my boyfriend on business and he made all the travel arrangements - which is unusal for me because I'm somewhat of a research freak. BUT, this time I left it up to him (and his company) to choose where we stayed and I just went with it.

On the last leg (and night) of a 10-day trip, we landed at the Westin Tokyo and we were pleasantly surprised!

Check-in was very fast and my boyfriend upgraded us to a Club/Executive room which included free breakfast and happy hour for an extra $700 yen/night - totally worth it! I think we paid $350 total for our night stay.

Back to the Club floor later, but let's start with the lobby! Really, really beautiful!! Lots of highly polished black marble, soaring ceilings and just very pleasing to the eye. There is a cafe/bakery, a formal restaurant and a restaurant/bar right off the loby - and that's all the farther we got past the room and the Club floor - so I can't speak of the other amenities in the hotel.

Our room was 1608 and we had an amazing view of the city and the Tokyo Tower! It was cool during the day, but stunning at night! We got some great photos!! I only read a few reviews, but the one mentioning no view must have stayed on a very low floor or on another side of the building I never saw. BEAUTIFUL!

The room was very large and had the super comfortable Heavenly Bed (king), a sofa and table, desk and another table and chair....very roomy. The bedding is white, crisp and soft - the pillows comfy. And the bathroom was gorgeous! Big bath tub, separate shower and a large vanity. Very, very nice!

The bath products smelled great, there were lots of towels and they provided us with a travelers kit with a brush, toothbrush, q-tips, etc which you could take with you if you chose. Nice touch.

We took advantage of the Club/Executive floor and headed up there after we checked in. There was a nice assortment of hard alcohol, beer, 2 red and 2 white wines, as well as juices and sodas. They also served really nice appetizers including salmon, chicken, duck and various other snacks. We sat and enjoyed several glasses of wine and the food, along with the beautiful view!!

In the morning the breakfast consisted of the usual - eggs, sausage, fruits, pastries, cereals, juices, etc and they were quick to replenish plates.

We did eat at the restaurant in the bar area - Brian got a chicken sandwich and I got the risotto (we had maxed out on Chinese and sushi!) and we thought it was fine. Not fabulous, but good. The prices were moderately high, but it's Tokyo and you're in a hotel!!! We expected to pay $15 for a chicken sandwich! There are several places nearby that we passed in the cab that looked very cute if you don't want to pay hotel prices.

We felt the hotel was lovely and we were very happy with our stay. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this Westin to all of my friends.

The only thing I'd say is that if you are looking for action, this really isn't the location for you. My boyfriend though he booked a hotel in Ginza, but this was miles away and would take 20+ minutes by cab to get there. We did take a cab to the Roppongi District and that main street was BUSY!!! Lots of clubs and restaurants to choose from. I think if we were to go again on our own (sans business,) we'd choose to stay in a more convenient area. 

If you are looking for a beautiful hotel in a quiet and upscale part of Tokyo, this is the place for you!

2,REDACTED,en,4318,"Having stayed at the Westin in Yebisu this past May during my first time in Tokyo, I was expecting the typeical goomy hotel room, limited on space and comfort. How wrong I was. Although in the traditional style rather than modern, the décor was more than sufficient and the room enormous. With great views towards the gardens and a relatively commanding view of the city, it was all topped off with the great Heavenly bed and very large bathroom.

One nice thought here was the toiletry bags with every possible thing in that you could need (apart from hair products and deodorant), so no need to worry about restrictions on carrying liquids on your flight if you are coming to the Westin here. You can also take these home.

Arrival was superb and I was upgraded to an executive deal including free internet and free breakfast. Gym facilities were good and the bar in the reception area had a lot of charm compared with most other hotel lobby bars. Room service was great – order a beer and they will wheel in an actual bar with beer pump and serve you right there and then. Marvellous!

The location of the Westin will not be ideal for everyone but is around 7 minute walk to Yebisu station and is right next to a shopping complex with all the stores you would need for last minute shopping, drugstore items or snacks and food.

Not outstanding, but 4 stars for overall high quality and non-fussy delivery of the core Westin product.

2,REDACTED,en,4319,"I stayed at the Westin Tokyo for 1 week in March 2007. I was there for business and this hotel was chosen for me due to the proximity to the office.
I had a very good experience at this hotel. Upon check-in, I was told that I had been given a very special room on the ladies floor. Apparently this is a new idea at the Westin and obviously just for women. All services including porter, room service, maid service, etc. are performed by women and no men are allowed on the floor. I was somewhat skeptical, but when I got to my room, I was very pleasantly surprised. Towards the end of the week, I moved to a ""regular"" room on a different floor so I can make an accurate comparison. My room on the ladies floor had the same furnishings and layout as a regular room but the extras included Bulgari bath products (wonderful smell!), a yoga mat and instructional DVD in the room, ionic hairdryer, female-specific toiletries like bath oil beads and salts, hair bands and clips, loofah, etc.
Overall, both my rooms were very large by Tokyo standards, the Westin Heavenly bed can't be beat and the service is wonderful, very consistent with Tokyo in general.
On a previous trip to Tokyo, I stayed at the New Otani in Akasaka and the only thing I liked more about that hotel was the location. The Westin Tokyo is in Ebisu which I personally didn't find too lively although there is some shopping and good restaurants and the Metro and JR lines are close by to take you to more ""happening"" parts of the city.
My only complaint with the hotel is that the on-site restaurants are ridiculously priced. I chose to purchase the Executive package with my room which included 50% off internet charge, happy hour and appetizers and breakfast included on the Executive floor. On my last day I woke up too late to take advantage of my free breakfast and paid the regular price in the cafe downstairs. I think it was more than US$30 for 2 eggs, 2 sausage and 2 small pastries. Tea and juice were of couse extra as well. Its really too pricey for what you get.

2,REDACTED,en,4320,"Stayed at the Westin Tokyo for 5 nights on business, because most other hotels were booked that period. If mahogany wood, black marble,
golden handles and opulent ornaments are your style, the Westin may be a good choice. If you prefer modern simplicity, and expect value for money, you should look elsewhere.

The good:
- Big hotel with accordingly wide offer of facilities
- Ebisu is a great place, and the Westin is the only major hotel
- The rooms are very spacious for Tokyo standards
- Big LCD TV, DVD-player, Fax and printer in the rooms 
- Very comfortable bed and pillows
- Safe has an electrical outlet inside (great for iPods etc.)
- Most of the distance to the station is covered 
- Mitsukoshi Department Store across the street

The bad:
- Maximizes turnover per customer (many services have quite a hefty fee - also see below)
- No nice views over the city
- Hotel is quite far away from the Station
- Small bathtub

The ugly:
- At a rack rate of 60.000 Yen, customers should not be charged separately for things you can take for granted, like In-room internet (1800 yen) and gym usage (1000 yen). 

The Westin is a nice hotel, especially for lovers of traditional American style luxury, but at this price point, I do expect more perfection. You can have similar luxury at half the price (e.g. Strings Hotel) or get more perfection at the same price (e.g. Grand Hyatt)",3,2007/03/20
2,REDACTED,en,4321,"I stayed here for a week in early March, 2007, and the entire experience was fantastic. I had the pleasure of being within the ""Executive Club,"" which included a wonderful high-floor room (huge!); access to the executive club for breakfast and cocktails; and other amenities. 

Ebisu is a great area of Tokyo, as well. A big high-end, great restaurants, amazing access to transportation, within a few minutes of all central Tokyo sights.
",5,2007/03/12
2,REDACTED,en,4322,"I visited the Westin Tokyo on a business trip between 17 Feb and 20 Feb and had a fabulous stay. As an SPG Platinum member, I was upgraded to a large room on the Executive Club floor. This room was large and elegant even by American standards, with a marble bathroom, HD TV, chaise lounge, couch and desk. 

Unlike the previous reviewer, I found the service to be among the most polite and detailed of anyplace I've ever stayed. The turndown service provides freshly pressed pajamas and a kimono and the housecleaning folks are as close to perfect as I've seen. For example, the bathroom had an amenities kit with toothpaste, razor, etc. and every day the staff replaced every single item in the kit--and didn't just put it on the counter, they put it in the proper spot in the kit, zipped it closed and placed it in its spot on the counter. That's pretty amazing in my book. 

My only ding on this place was for room service. I ordered a green curry chicken that was almost inedible--three very fatty slices of chicken, totaling maybe 1.5 ounces, all for a mere $30. 

That aside, I would return in a heartbeat.
",5,2007/02/21
2,REDACTED,en,4323,"This hotel is fantastic. Wonderful rooms. Nicely appointed and the largest I have ever had in Tokyo. You'll think you are in the US or Europe.

The service here is top notch. Not only does everyone speak English, but you will receive that legendary Japanese style attention every time you meet a hotel employee.

And the location is a probably the only nice western style locale in the urban jungle of Tokyo. Here you will find tree-lined streets... yes... trees in Tokyo... it was a breath of fresh air... literally! You will find a nice open space mall with shops and restaurants right across the street.

The restaurants here are top notch. I highly recommend the Japanese steak house on the 22nd floor. The supreme beef is probably the best steak I have ever had... served up by a chef righ in front of you. Expect to pay $350 for a dinner for two with a bottle of wine. Well worth every yen.

2,REDACTED,en,4324,"John and Artemis Goldacre visited the Westin as part of our annual holiday, away from the perfect Island of Fuerteventura where we live, we wanted a hotel that had comfort and luxary with easy access to shops and as much entertainment we could muster, The Westin Tokyo provided all this with no disappointments.
Plenty of high quality shops on hand within a five minute walk, alittle further takes you to the main JR Line station of Ebisu where access to the whole of tokyo is a short comfortable train ride away ,once you have worked out the subway it is cheap and efficient as taxis can be very expensive.
A day at Disneyland Tokyo is a must as well as a visit to the Imperial Palace.
Our room had a perfect view of mount FUJI on a clear day which it is said if you see Fuji in the morning you are destined for a lucky day and every day we felt lucky.
The staff were great and accomodating a perfect place for your home from home in a big city.

2,REDACTED,en,4325,"Did not join membership until now Jan 1, 2007.

Stayed 3 nights in April 2004 while visiting Tokyo during our two weeks of vacation in Japan.

Worth to stay at the club floor, at the 17th floor. It included great breakfast upstair at the club floor lounge or at the main restaurant. The evening cocktails were worth the cost of the upgrade to the club floor. They showed the bill for the cocktails for signature.

Lot of shopping at the hotel area. A bit of a walk to the nearest subway, about 2 km.

Great hotel to stay.
",5,2006/12/31
2,REDACTED,en,4326,"Stayed on Starwood points - not sure I would do so otherwise given the room rates. A five minute walk (some distance) from the subway. Nice hotel, nice rooms. Ebisu area has some nice restaurants and ok shopping/sights.",4,2006/12/25
2,REDACTED,en,4327,"Great hotel for travelers. The staff were very helpful, and the lounge had great breakfasts. It's a bit near the outskirts of Tokyo (Ebisu area), but about a 5 min walk from the JR train station.",5,2006/10/29
2,REDACTED,en,4328,"I stayed twice in Westin Tokyo. Business purpose. 
Hotel is a bit too expensive for my taste (around 300$ US/night),but when company is paying it's welcomed.
Hotel is really good, rooms big with all you need and don't need inside, bathrooms are large with separated shower and tub, with all sorts of little goods for making the things better in the bathroom.
I was on 12 and 13th floor, view was nice, panoramic, as the window is big. Hotel and hotel area is quiet, ideal for business travelers. Situated in Ebisu area, with shopping mall (nothing special for me) just across the street. JR train is around 500 meters from hotel (6-7 minutes walking).
Everything is very nice, but if I had to give my money, I would choose another 5-star hotel, cheaper and similar in service...
",4,2006/09/14
2,REDACTED,en,4329,"Westin Tokyo in Ebisu is great for US families. Rooms are large, plenty of amenities, and location is great -- Ebisu Center has most everything you might need right there, and it's quick to the Yamanote (sp?) circle line which takes you anywhere pretty quickly.

Rooms are very good sized for Tokyo, with nice views to the Tokyo Tower. Great soundproofing, good bathrooms -- a nice place to relax after sightseeing in Tokyo.

2,REDACTED,en,4330,"I recently stayed at The Westin Tokyo while on vacation with my 12 year old son. The hotel staff was friendly, helpful, and for the most part spoke English. The concierge who each day helped us arrange for a tour or indicated which train we needed to take was especially helpful. It was raining during our stay; fortunately the hotel provided us with two umbrellas each morning on our way out of the door - which I though was a nice touch of hospitality.

The Ebisu subway station is a short 10 minute walk from the hotel (you can ride the moving walkways for at least half of the distance). The hotel is conveniently located on the west side of Tokyo and you are no more than 15 minutes away (by subway) from Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ikebukuro, Roppongi, Ginza, or Tokyo station. Lucky for us Yebisu Gardens (adjacent to the hotel) shows English language films on a giant outdoor screen during July and August (last night we watched Chicago) and best of all it is free of charge.

The room was clean, well maintained, and comfortable. The only not-so positive comment I have is that the restaurants in the hotel are a bit on the expensive side (relatively speaking of course, since we are in Tokyo). I don’t usually stay at the Westin when in Tokyo on business but given the opportunity to stay here again while on vacation – I would do so without hesitation.
",4,2006/07/20
2,REDACTED,en,4331,"We just returned from a 5 night stay at the Westin Tokyo & we were very pleased with the service, location & our room. This was a vacation trip & we used Starwood points for the entire stay so expected less then luxe accomodations. We were pleasantly surprised with our room (826) which appeared to be oversized & had a seating area. The hotel is a 5-10 minute walk to the Ebisu Metro/Train station - leaving the hotel from the B1 level you can reach the station without going outside. There are many restaurants in the Garden complex as well as the surrounding neighborhood. 
The Concierge in the Business Center was quite helpful & printed maps when we asked how to get to specific locations.
Our personal experience at the Westin Tokyo was a good one.
",5,2006/06/20
2,REDACTED,en,4332,"Stayed for a total of a week and a half in March.

This was the second time staying at the Westin Tokyo. I've stayed at a couple of other hotels in Tokyo and still prefer this one over some of the others. 

Nothing beats the Heavenly Beds at the Westin chains and this one is just like all the others. They had a choice of 2 different types of pillows so you can sleep in comfort. 

In addition, the staff was very helpful. The concierge will be happy to supply you with maps and directions to wherever you need to go. They were also helpful in writing questions like ""Can you recommend a good sake?"" in Japanese so that I can just take it to the department store of my choosing.

I only had one negative experience during this trip but it was rectified so in the end I was happy. While the rate is really good (I think it's about US$10 for a 7-day access card), access is only available in the lobby and unfortunately for my laptop was unrealiable. So unrealiable that I had to complain. The first time I complained, they did not offer me any other option but the second time I complained, the concierge offered to give me access to the wireless access on the club room floor for no additional charge. On the club room floor I had no problems accessing the internet. Upon check-out, they had even removed the initial 7-day access card fee. 

In terms of location, it is close to the Ebisu station on the JR line and Hibiya line. It was very convenient for me both for my business meetings and personal shopping (in Shibuya, Harajuku, and Shinjuku).

For those traveling with a JR railway pass that you buy before you go to Japan (a good deal if you're going to other cities in Japan), you should also note that the JR railway pass is good for the JR 'subway' line in Tokyo. You just have to show your pass to the attendant. 

In comparison, I've stayed at the Grand Hyatt and the Cerulean Tower. I probably prefer the Grand Hyatt over the Westin but it does generally cost more. Plus, I'm not a fan of the Roppongi area. As for the Cerulean Tower, it was a good hotel as well but the service level (while still exceptional over North American hotels) was below both of the other hotels. The Westin is a great deal and is in a great area of Tokyo.

2,REDACTED,en,4333,"My friends and I stayed here for 4 nights and we had nothing but trouble. Not 5-star service at all. The rooms were too expensive for the poor service we had. Other friends stayed in a better hotel and they got what they paid for. The Westin is far from the hot spots and tourist sights. The walk to the train station was far. The taxi fares add up. You can find a better hotel in the same price range closer to everything. The breakfast and lunch buffets were like cafeteria food. It's not a dump by any means but it is not hip and modern like you would imagine in Tokyo. There are better places so keep searching!
",1,2006/04/17
2,REDACTED,en,4334,"Based on negative reviews from several travellers I was a bit apprehensive about staying at this hotel. However, I had a wonderful stay and was quite impressed by the excellent service. I saw no difference in the treatment of Japanese vs non-Japanese guests by the hotel staff. Indeed, staff were always attentive and had a good command of English. Concierge services were excellent. Breakfast buffet was OK and reasonably priced. Hotel restaurants were great (particularly the Teppanyaki restaurant on the 22nd floor), although a bit overpriced, but that is the norm in hotel restaurants in Japan. Room was huge by Japanese standards with great beds (heavenly beds) and very good views. Bathroom was also huge, with separate shower/bathtub facilities; good water pressure in the shower. I am not a fan of the hotel's French faux-European decoration, but I tended to overlook it, since the hotel is excellently maintained. Location is not as central as other hotels in Marounouchi, but it is very convenient to such areas as Shibuya, Shinjuku, Omotesando, Roppongi and Shinagawa (via the subway or the JR Yamanote line). Hotel is connected by underground passages via the Yebisu Garden Place to the Ebisu station (about 10 minutes away), so you can avoid bad weather conditions. Also, the Yebisu Garden Place is a very nice area with a good department store (Mitsukoshi) and a large choice of restaurants. Overall, a great hotel with excellent service.

2,REDACTED,en,4335,"If you want great customer service and to be treated the same as any other guest than DO NOT STAY AT THE WESTIN! We were treated poorly compared to the JAPANESE customers. It was a terrible experience. Other reviews stated this and we assumed that the others were just being ""ugly americans"" but they were not. It was true. The Grand Hyatt was better as we changed hotels after 3 nights in the Westin. It is also out of the way from anything interesting to see. I would never stay in such a place again. Westin USA should look into this poor treatment of foreign customers by the Japanese. It was awful.",1,2006/01/21
2,REDACTED,en,4336,"Good things: large room, comfortably furnished and modern. General ambience is impressive - very much a five-star establishment. Service is professional. Executive lounge is excellent (including free breakfast and evening drinks / hors-d`oeuvres). Good choice of restaurants (but pretty expensive).

Debatable: Location. Very handy for the pleasant Ebisu Garden Palace area, with shops and restaurants; only an easy ten minute walk, mainly along moving walkways, to Ebisu station. Yet not actually in one of the main areas that most visitors to Tokyo would want to see.

Very frustrating: no swimming pool.

2,REDACTED,en,4337,"My husband and I were treated poorly by the staff of this hotel. We were locked out of our room in the middle of the night and were not allowed to enter our room for more than 2 hours until the staff figured out that they had made a grave error. We have never been treated like that by any staff in any hotel in Europe and North America. Beware of what you are getting yourself into if you choose this hotel. If anything goes wrong then it will be assumed that it has somehow happened because of you. We will not return to this hotel when we come back to TOKYO next spring. It was more expensive than other 5-star hotels and hardly worth it. We are STARWOOD PREFERRED CUSTOMERS and were shocked by this treatment. It was truly a poor, poor experience in a very foreign land. As far as hotel ammentities are concerned they were adequate but far from 5-star hotels we have stayed in before. The restaurant food was very low quality. It was also quite far from most sights in Tokyo. Do not stay here....
",1,2005/11/28
2,REDACTED,en,4338,"My two friends and I stayed here for 6 nights in NOV. '05 and we had some pretty bad experiences. We arrived to the hotel at 3am after a night out and all of our key cards were cancelled and when we went to the desk we were treated as if we were criminals. Ultimately they figured out that when we checked in that the desk staff had entered the wrong check-out date and it was their mistake. We had to wait until after 5:30 am for them to figure this out. The general manager said that we should have been allowed to enter our room and that it should have been taken care of during the day. The NAZI desk staff would not budge as we were foreigners. I live in JAPAN and speak Japanese so I was following the conversations. It would have been handled differently had the guests been Japanese. This is the down side of being a foreigner in Japan sometimes but I would have expected more from the WESTIN HOTEL. We lost a day of our trip to TOKYO because of this. We splept through a tour we had planned and we were unable to re-book it. We were given many ""sorry's"" and many deep bows and were given one night for free but it soured our hotel experience. Tokyo was AWESOME so I suggest you look for another hotel to fully appreciate this GREAT city!! The desk supervisor arranged reservations for my two friends in the TEPPAN YAKI STEAK HOUSE on the 22nd floor for their last night in TOKYO and when they arrived they had to wait 20 minutes to be told that it would have to take 1 MORE HOUR for them to get a table because they lost the reservation!! What kind of service is that? They offered to send them out of the hotel to another place but they waited and when they got the check they were charged a table charge and my friend refused to pay it. The next morning I had to call the hotel's general manager and the general manager in the KYOTO WESTIN who will be the new GM in TOKYO soon to get that dinner taken off of their total bill. That meal should have been complimentary to begin with. This would most likely not happen in other credible 5-star hotels. There are better hotels closer to the action than the WESTIN. KEEP SEARCHING! By the way, we were allowed to eat the lunch buffet as a result of us sleeping through breakfast the day we were locked out and the food was terrible. The breakfast was never great either. The executive room on the 17th floor was fairly crowded and tables were often full of dirty dishes and guests had to stand around to wait for tables to be cleared. After the one free night and free dinner it was not worth 370,000 yen for 6 nights! LOOK FOR BETTER!!
",1,2005/11/24
2,REDACTED,en,4339,"Well, I do not know how this hotel could possibly be the best in Tokyo as another reviewer put it. His last line about getting the most for your money says it right there. If you want something cheap that is posing as something else then stay here. The Park Hyatt or Grand Hyatt are both much better as well as better located. The 4 Season's is also better. The staff was rude to us on a few occasions. They were definitely not all 5-star trained. The location was not convenient at all. The breakfast and lunch buffets were awful. Well, more like airplane food in business class as it looked good and was semi-edible. I do not understand the buffet mentality at a ""5-star"" hotel. The food is hardly fresh. This is just a dressed up holiday inn and nothing more. Do not even consider it.
",1,2005/11/23
2,REDACTED,en,4340,"People that don't know anything about Tokyo can't appreciate that the Westin Tokyo is in probably the best location anywhere in the city. Along the Yamanote line, sandwiched between Daikanyama, Shibuya Hiroo, Aoyama and the rest. A short trip on Hibiya Line to Ginza, a short cab to Omotesando and all the great places to shop, lazz around or just plop down at a Ebisu cafe and watch the people, the location is unrivaled period.

As far as the hotel goes, you're right, it's not super Japanesey, but if that's what you want go to Kyoto. It's sophisticated, comfortable, and exudes class. Service is typical Japanese so the highest standards anywhere in the world.

Bottom line the best Hotel in Tokyo for the money.

2,REDACTED,en,4341,"baffled at the comments by other users of this hotel. there is nothing even slightly japanese about this hotel. actaually it is far more faux european. the bathromms are nor marble as stated in another review, they are dusty rose color ceramic tile accented with black granite counter tops. the furniture is not beidermeier but rather of similar design made of veneer. all inlay and wood surfaces are made or a similar product that is a photographic polymer sheeting. it all adds to the ""feel"" of elegance with a fraction of the cost. all paintings and portraiture vague european reproduction. cheap and out of place productions at best.

comfortable beds and large bathrooms suitable for families. very short internet cords present a number of poblems. true heavenly beds.very good sleep. ice down the hall. fast service and very thourough housekeeping. shops, bank postal office,restaurants all contained in this complex as well as the super pretionious joel roubichon restaurant. long haul to the metro station with an even longer haul to anyplace else on the tourist side of things. this hotel is geared to the business man working in the local area, event planners(weddings galore)or the north american tourist.

though there is nthing ""wrong""with this hotel, language presented a problem as did wrong directons. though many users have enjoyed it, i would never stay here again. older places such as the imperial, the new otani(old builing, not tower) or the okura are far better bets. or spend the money and just stay at the park hyatt or brand new grand hyatt in roppongi hills. the westin is a suckers bet for those that want no reminder that they are actually in japan. if that's the case, why go?

2,REDACTED,en,4342,"This is a beautiful hotel. It is luxurious. The staff lives up to the amazing Westin standard of service. The rooms are large (huge by Japanese standards) with all of the creature comforts. I loved it. The wife loved it. And the kids loved it.

I have only 2 quibbles. First, it's a bit of a shlep from the Ebisu station. Yes, there are moving sidewalks which makes them go fast. But this involves a large series of short moving sidewalks. After a couple trips to the Yamanote line and Hibiya line, it got old. That said, I don't think any of the best hotels is any more convenient to the stations; however, many ""business hotels"" are, but the rooms are smaller and they aren't nearly as luxurious. Second, the hotel is very EUROPEAN. Nothing bad about that, but it doesn't feel like Tokyo. Maybe they have Japanese rooms?

2,REDACTED,en,4343,"My partner and I were traveling to Tokyo for the first time, and based on previous travel experiences, we decided that it would be less of a culture shock to stay in American style hotels... based on reviews in Tripadvisor, we chose to stay at the Westins in Tokyo and Kyoto. Both were great choices. The Westin Tokyo is in an incredibly clean and modern area called Ebisu... which is train/metro close to everything. The hotel staff were gracious; no problem checking in. They upgraded us to the club level, and we had a beautiful breakfast buffet (albeit western) and evening cocktail hour every day. As we had used Starwood's 50% off award, and the fact that there is no tipping, we got tremendous value for $300 a night. The concierge was especially helpful in advising us... even had a flat screen TV with all Japan's weather conditions on the wall. Our best evening was when we bought gourmet japanese food from the food hall of the neighboring department store, putting on our hotel provided kimonos, and eating in our room with the beautiful view of the lights of Tokyo. We both highly recommend a visit to Japan... and this hotel. John and Dean from Pasadena.",5,2005/07/08
2,REDACTED,en,4344,"My husband, daughter and I recently stayed here for three nights. We paid just a tiny bit extra to stay on the executive club level. Let me tell you, the service we received was wonderful! We had tons of questions (how do we get here, what do you recommend) and they even looked up a special store to which we wanted to take our daughter. The staff were attentive, attentive, attentive!! My husband and daughter enjoyed the breakfast buffet in the club each morning and we all loved going in the evenings where they treated my daugther as specially as the rest of the guests. You could have pretty much whatever cocktail you wished (fairly simple though--martinis, etc.) or lovely glasses of wine to have with a nice light appetizer/snack buffet.

The rooms were really great--a nice oasis after a hot and busy day of sighseeing. Rooms included slippers, heavy terry robes or lightweight cotton robes--take your pick, and complimentary bottles of water. The bathroom is as great as everyone describes. You have to close your eyes and forget about the prices when ordering room service (we did, after arriving very late on our first evening--this is Tokyo after all) but the food was great and hot. We had a wonderful meal in the Chinese restaurant one night. The hotel is close to two very nice shopping ""centers"" (though they are so close together that they are really just one). We enjoyed browsing and the centers included many, many food choices! (The little french bakery right near the hotel in the ""underground"" is TO DIE FOR!) 

I've read some complaints about the walk to the subway but we never minded it as the area is lovely. The subway is easy to use and a great way to get around town. 

A beautiful hotel in a wonderful location that just added to our excellent trip!

2,REDACTED,en,4345,"The Westin Tokyo was an amazing place to stay. I can't comment on value because I traded my Starwood points for a 3 night stay here in April. The room was large and elegantly appointed. The bathroom was the largest we had seen in a Japanese room. Larger than most hotels in the US as well. There was a tub and also a full walk in shower with full pressure showerheads. 

The lobby is just stunning in all black marble, brass and wood trim. The hotel staff was perfect in every way. It was almost like we were not in Japan at all. We always were greeted by an assistant who spoke perfect English. All of the door staff greeted us with a ""Hello"" or ""Good Morning"". They then shifted to greet the group behind us in Japanese customary style. 

The highest compliment I can give is when a hotel staff person remembers you days later. We were met by several Japanese friends who spoke little english. The hotel concierge acted as interperter for us to plan our day. Now this was 15 minutes of conversation at 10AM, not a slow time of day at a hotel. She never looked as she wanted to get to something else to do and made sure we both knew the plan. When we were checking out, she came up to us and asked how our day went and was it to our liking. 

The walk back and forth to the JR line (approx 15 minutes) became a bit tedious after 3 days and the food locations tend to close a bit early for us. However, those were the only things I could fault the hotel about.",5,2005/06/28

Great breakfast ,in fact after 4 weeks travelling around the country we have not had another one that is as good, range ,quality and value.
The staff were friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable. Good english by many which was a blessing. Our only negative was the fitness club/ pool not being in the hotel itself.

2,REDACTED,en,4347,"I just can't say enough good things about the Westin Tokyo. I am in Tokyo a lot on business and have tried other hotels before finding this one. First off, the location of the hotel is great. It is surrounded by three different malls right across the street (Mitsokushi, Atres, Glass Square) which has various places to eat and browse through during your free time. To the train and subway, it is about a 10 minute walk, but with so much to see while walking there, it becomes a very quick walk. Also, you are easily connected to both the JR lines and the subway, which makes traveling through Tokyo very efficient.

The service at this hotel is belong superb. Before arriving to the hotel, I emailed the hotel several times to arrange early check-in for my brother who was to arrive several hours ahead of me. They responded very quickly and provided me with all the details to make getting to the hotel and checking very easy. Out of all the hotels I've stayed in, they are the most accomodating by far.

The rooms at this hotel is larger than most Japan hotel rooms. Although, if you do get 2 double beds, keep in mind that you'll probably be getting 2 twin+ beds rather than 2 queen size beds. Overall, the room was large, and grand. The bathroom is GIGANTIC. It has a huge tub AND a separate shower which was very nice. 

I was very happy with this hotel, and would recommend it to anyone staying in Tokyo and would definitely stay here again.",5,2005/03/29
2,REDACTED,en,4348,"I stayed at the Westin for 5 nights in March and found the hotel very pleasing. The staff is extremely friendly and all are happy to converse in English (a nice feeling after touring the city). It is in a slightly remote location on the southwest side of town, but the both train and subway is a 10 minute walk away facilitated by covered moving walkways (after crossing the courtyard of a nice upscale shopping area, the Ebisu Garden).

I do have to admit the hotel is on the pricey side, but with the current exchange rate, most are overpriced when considering the US dollar. Also, try to avoid a corner room, although comfortable in design, the regular rooms are larger. There is a bus shuttle for Narita that stops at the hotel hourly - 3000 yen (currently about $30 US) and takes about two hours.

2,REDACTED,en,4351,"My husband and I just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel during a 9 night stay in Japan (the Westin in Kyoto left much to be desired) But the Westin in Tokyo was beautiful and luxiourious. Not to mention in a great area, near shops and restaurants. The staff is very attentive and always waiting to help. The bathrooms were beautiful with marbel. We were in our rooms on the 16th floor when the earthquake hit 2 weeks ago and had no idea the entire city is built for that. That was an interesting experience. The only negative is that we went to the top floor piano bar for a drink and had no idea that they charge a $12.50 per person cover charge. That seemed to be mentioned on the drink menu once you were already inside. Otherwise, would definately go there again!
",5,2004/11/02
2,REDACTED,en,4352,"As a regular business traveler to Tokyo, I make it a point to stay mostly at the Westin. Its rooms are among the biggest and best-equipped in the city, it has fast broadband internet service with reliable VPN connections, its health club is one of the best equipped and most comprehensive in Japan (with a plethora of cardio/weight machines, swimming pool, saunas, and even racquetball courts), it has a comprehensive and efficient business center and excellent concierge service, and its overall service quality is consistently superior. Another positive is that the service staff remembers the little things--such as my favorite international newspapers and breakfast buffet preferences. 

About the only downside to the hotel is its location--in slightly out-of-the-way Ebisu--which is about half-way between Meguro/Shinagawa and Shibuya/Shinjuku, on the western side of Tokyo. However, the Yebisu Gardens development that the Westin is a part of is quite self-contained, with several office towers and high-end apartment complexes housing multinational corporations and their ex-patriate staffs, and an adjacent mall anchored by a large department store, an upscale grocery store ($80 melons, anyone?), a well-stocked pharmacy-drugstore, and numerous boutiques, beer halls, and a broad range of restaurants (from all manners of Japanese to Korean to Chinese to Thai to Italian to German to McDonalds).

The French-lacquered decor of the immaculately-polished lobby and the rooms is very distinctive--although I lean more towards simple, modernistic furnishings. However, it is apparently a favorite of brides and grooms in Tokyo as the hotel is often filled to the brim on weekends with as many as a dozen separate wedding engagements. So don't be surprised to run into wedding parties dressed in both western and traditional Japanese garb in the common areas.

All in all, the Westin Tokyo provides unparalleled amenities and seamless service for business and for pleasure. Based on my past experiences, I would highly recommend it.

2,REDACTED,en,4353,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Westin Tokyo for 2 nights in April 2004. I researched a lot on the internet about the hotel and its surroundings. I have heard from others who stayed here that it is convenient to get around, and you can walk through the walkway for 5 minutes from the station to get to the hotel. And this turned out to be the only thing bad about getting to the hotel. With a big suitcase, the walk from the station to the hotel is long and tiring. We realized later that the MAIN entrance is on the other side, but sice we were always using the trains, we always ended up using the walkway. But now the hotel. The hotel is so grand! The lobby is clean and well kept. Check in was very smooth and the bellman escorted us to our room. First thing we said when he opened the door was, ""Wow..."" I felt bad even staying here. It was that nice. The minibar is packed with Sapporo beer (I hear that they are the owner?) and I was surprised to see a very packed liquor collection when I opened one of the drawers. The Westin hotels are known for their heavenly bed, and yes, it was! Very comfortable. The bathroom was amazing. There were both a bathtub and a shower. The vanity was beautiful and was packed with amenities. Even the shampoos were not those cheapy ones you see in most hotels. There is also a green pouch with amenities you can use during your stay. I did not get to try the restaurants, but I would definitely stay here again and try everything i missed. There is also a Tsutaya video store next door if you feel like buying CD's and Videos. I did!

I find this quite inconvenient when all I wanted to do was throw back, kick back & relax till the next day flight.

Going to Port Yokohama to meet our Princess Cruise ship is not a problem. Taxi is available to seniors but a train is also available to Port Yokohama.

The location could not have been better for the ANA check in desk.... right beside it. We dumped our bags here in the morning as the room would not be ready till 2pm. We then took the monorail from the airport directly to the heart of Tokyo in a matter of minutes.

The hotel was clean, comfortable and the room a reasonable size. Check in was easy as was check out. Wi-fi perfect. The only issue was that the room safe was not working. As we wanted to eat later in the evening at the airport after our day in Tokyo, we had to carry our valuables around the airport with us.

3,REDACTED,en,4363,"The convenience of an airport hotel is the reason to stay at the Excel Haneda. Rooms OK without being wonderful. Large enough and quiet.
Issues to be aware of - 
English is not well spoken by any of the staff, which is unusual now in Tokyo, so if you have issues, it's not always easy to communicate, assuming you don't speak Japanese :-) As an example, we arrived early and asked if we could get into our room any earlier than the 2pm check-in time. The only response was for two front-desk staff, one after the other, to write 2PM on a piece of paper and show that to us. No offer to store bags, point us to the cafe, etc, which would be standard in better city hotels.
The hotel is attached to departure area of terminal 2, which is a domestic facility. The international terminal is a shuttle ride away, which, while being free, is a 10 minute walk down to the next level, arrivals.
Breakfast is average, but OK. We ate there one evening and that was very good.
So, it's fine really, just not great.",3,2017/09/05

The hotel is situated in the domestic terminal and directly accessible by train on foot from the station via half a dozen escalators and some walking. If coming from the train bear in mind that the train line does not take Japan Rail Pass so payment via Pasmo card or cash will be needed. There are 2 domestic terminal buildings and, despite having a map from the hotel we still managed to wind up in the wrong building and had to get a shuttle bus to the right place. Be very careful therefore on leaving the railway station!! Airport hotels are rarely outstanding. This one was friendly and the rooms were fine and quiet. We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant and it was a bit average. Overall however I think the place was pretty decent.

There is one issue however, which I feel that the management require to address, and that concerns the computer system which they have within their foyer for guests to use - for when I tried to use this to check in and print out boarding passes for onward flights, it led to a lot of confusion and frustration. To use the computer you have to feed in money, which was so difficult and frustrating, and staff did not seem to understand the difficulties. This resulted in costing me the equivalent of £7.00 to check in and print out boarding passes - something which I have never experienced in any other airport hotel in the world which I have visited !",5,2016/11/24

Rooms very spacious,comfortable & very quiet considering you're in the middle of the airport! Hotel has a bar area along with a restaurant but is very expensive. Cheaper places a short walk away in the terminal.",5,2016/10/31
3,REDACTED,en,4400,"Built within Tokyo Haneda's Domestic Terminal 2, it is easily seen at the other end from a behemoth of a check in hall. Staff were very friendly and a few weeks before I had asked to see if I could have the rooms joined together via. inter-connecting door between the rooms which they wasn't sure they could and when we checked in and was shown to our rooms courtesy of the staff the rooms were inter-connected and honoured as promised. Rooms were huge and high quality. Check out was very easy and quick with excellent shuttle services to connect to the International terminal. I would certainly stay at this highly professional hotel again.",5,2016/10/28
3,REDACTED,en,4401,"We stayed at the hotel for one night post cruise.
Hotel is attached to the Domestic terminal which means you can use the terminal restaurants and browse the shops to pass away some time.
Room was clean and comfortable, it overlooked the runway and stand areas so plenty to watch from your window.
Staff were very friendly and helpful, like so many Japanese hotels check in is mid afternoon and we arrived early morning, but they have a luggage drop zone and deliver your luggage to your room once room is ready for occupancy.
Free wifi in the lobby.
As always a small, compact bathroom but plenty of toiletries and supplies to use.
There is a free terminal transfer bus stop just outside the hotel which we used the next morning to get to the International terminal for our BA flight back to Heathrow.
All worked out very well and would certainly use the hotel again.",5,2016/10/26
3,REDACTED,en,4402,"I had an overnight layover at Haneda Airport, and this hotel was incredibly convenient -- right in Domestic Terminal 2 (the ANA terminal). I was worried about noise, but it was super-quiet and relaxing. The room itself was spacious, with all of the necessary amenities. One can pay extra for a view of the runway, but I had a view of the bus terminal and city, which was fine. I didn't try the meal because it was quite expensive, and there is lots of fine dining in Terminal 2. No complaints whatsoever.",5,2016/10/25
3,REDACTED,en,4403,"I stayed at this hotel at the recommendation of a co-worker. It was everything that he said it was. Normally people use airport hotels for long layovers or day use rooms, but I used it to stay for vacation. 

I don't speak Japanese, but the hotel employees did speak and understand enough for me to get awesome service. I know that the Japanese people always take their service toward others a step above and it shows. They were always polite and professional and helped me as much as they could when I needed it. The room was always clean when I came back, more so than most hotels I have stayed at. The location is in one of the Haneda airport domestic terminals, next to the ANA check in area. As you can imagine, there is a whole bunch of restaurants, shops and stores in close proximity. Downstairs you can find the Japan Railway that takes you to the other terminals and Tokyo, you can catch the train to Hamamasutcho Station and can go pretty much anywhere from there. The airport also has buses that will take you to the hotel to enter from the outside, its just a matter of finding where to catch the bus. The information desk employees are always willing to help with maps and directions, the person I spoke with spoke passable English, so that helped a lot.

They have a business center in the lobby right in front of the front desk and you can see out into the check in area of the airport, an interesting set up and forget about privacy. Funny thing, while I was using it to get tickets to Tokyo Disney, there was an earthquake. I was standing so I felt it good. I've been in an earthquake before, but I looked around to see if anyone else noticed, hehe, of course since it happens so often here, the Japanese people are walking around like nothing happened.

The bed in the room was on the firm side, I believe it was the Japanese futon type mattress on a platform bed frame. Lower to the floor, but not on the floor. The bathroom was great, the best part of the room. The shower plumbing was easy to use and very nice. They had one of those toilets with the gadgets and sprays on it, great for that extra clean feel, see ya baby wipes! The laundry service was great, I would have preferred self serve but not available. I don't think I have ever seen laundry folded and presented that perfectly before. 

One thing to note, I guess if you stay over a certain amount of days, they want you to pay that portion of the hotel bill then continue with the rest of the days. Not a big deal, but important to mention. I got a call one night to asking to come down and take care of that, I was irritated initially and had asked to take care of it in the morning which they agreed to but the woman on the phone was so nice I came down and took care of it that night.

Though I enjoyed this hotel a lot, I don't think I would stay here again, only because since I see airports so much, I would rather see something else when on vacation. If I am just on a layover, absolutely I would stay here again.",5,2016/10/24
3,REDACTED,en,4404,"At the end of domestic terminal two stands the Excel Hotel. It is the most basic of hotels, a bed, shower and WiFi...but, what more do you need?

There are lots of restaurants in terminal 2, too. It's a great place to crash - great customer service and clean.",5,2016/10/23
3,REDACTED,en,4405,"I usually booked the hotel at the international terminal but find the hotel becomes noisier each time. So I tried the Haneda Excel this time.

Their service is good. The room at reasonable size, clean but the furniture of my room is a bit worn out.

If you arrive or will depart in the international terminal, you will need to take the airport free shuttle bus or a monorail to the hotel. It is a about 5-10 minutes ride to reach the domestics terminal 2 in both cases. And the hotel is connected to the T2.

You will find there are better dining choices at T2. The food quality and service are much better than the international terminal.

It was fairly straight forward to find - right at the back of T2 domestics and the hotel standard was fairly high.

3,REDACTED,en,4414,"Airport hotels are always really expensive, because they don't have to compete on price. But sometimes I also find airport hotels to be alright, because they usually provide for the most sufficient supplies for overlays. Although this hotel had toothbrushes, shower cap etc., they did not provide any water (I was willing to pay for it). After 18 hours of traveling all I needed was water and sleep. 
Also the staff didn't really seem to care about me or my questions. It really felt like I was interfering with whatever they were doing. I was the only one in the reception, so it wasn't because they were challenged with big crowds. 
Last but not least; I needed a printed receipt for my work, that would state, that I did in fact spent the night. But I was told they couldn't print one for me, as my order was through hotels.com. I found that to be really weird, but again they didn't really wanted to talk to me, so I just left as the receptionist went on with something else.

First off, this place is attached to the airport so you only need to walk past the ANA check in, past Security Gate A in Terminal 2, and your at the hotel entrance, Very convenient. I was greeted at the door by a very lovely bell hop with a with a huge smile. She immediately grabbed my bags and escorted me to the front counter. I just came from a week at the Omni in San Diego, at twice the cost, and they never touched a bag of mine. After a quick check in with a very friendly and professional front desk staff, the bell hop escorted me to my room, explaining to me the amenities of the hotel. Both the bell hop and the front desk staff had decent English speaking skills as we our exchanges were in both English and my broken Japanese. The room was a good size and I had a, what seemed like a queen size bed. What I really love about Japanese hotels is all the amenities in the room which most American hotels don’t have. Shampoo, Conditioner, body soap, hand soap and then tooth brushes/tooth paste, razor, shaving cream, brush, etc. You have to ask for those type of things in most American hotels. The room was absolutely spotless which I could not say for the Omni. Although there is no mini bar in the room, just down the hall are vending machines with beer and chuhai (light cocktails) at very reasonable prices. Check out was fast and efficient and the ANA check in counter is just about 200 meters from the hotel entrance. If you need to stay close to Haneda, this is the place to be…",5,2016/08/24

The welcome on arrival was friendly, quick and efficient. The rooms were small as normal in Japan but would have been big enough even if we had had luggage. A kimono was provided (great for those with no pjs). When I woke in the morning I discovered that I had managed to leave my bag with all our money and credit cards in it on the shuttle. The staff rang up for me, located the bag, walked me to the taxi rank and hailed a cab for me and checked when I got back that everything was OK.

I ordered a continental breakfast from service which was thoughtfully prepared. Overall an excellent experience except for 2 disappointments - the wifi was woefully slow and the noise from screaming kids along the hallway during early hours of the morning - the latter of no fault to the hotel but a disappointing trend of parents unwilling to discipline children here in Japan",4,2016/07/14

Even from the international terminal, it takes only 3mins with a free airport bus between terminals. The room is good and the service is great in my view. This hotel is mainly for busy business travelers but another way to use this hotel is to use the express buses from this airport terminal to the place such as Tokyo Disneyland. It takes about 40min with a few stops. So you can leave the luggage at hotel, enjoy Tokyo DL for a day, come back at late afternoon by the same express bus to the airport and take off at night or next day in the morning.",4,2016/07/04

Access to the hotel from the Haneda International Terminal requires a Tokyo Monorail transfer to Domestic Terminal 2 (JPY 200 per person one way). The walk from B1 to level 2 where the hotel is located is a bit far, but there is no need to walk outdoors. 

We had booked a triple but were upgraded to a forth (4 double beds). The room was clean with all the amenities you would expect in a typical Japanese business hotel. The bathroom was surprisingly big (for Japanese standards). Some of the furniture upholstery was a bit worn or faded. 

There are no reasons to stay at this hotel other than for transiting. We were not aware of the Park Royal at the international terminal, otherwise we would have at least compared with that hotel since its location is much more convenient for transiting between international flights.",3,2016/06/23

Check in was friendly and relatively quick. The room was small for American standard, but somewhat large for a Japanese hotel room. Room was clean and efficiently organized. The bed was reasonably comfortable. Really like that a portion of the mirror was heated and thus clear when shaving after the shower. 

The amenities includes: instant coffee service, toothbrush w toothpaste, brush, razor, shave cream, shampoo, conditioner, body soap, slippers and robe (small man size).

That aside, the Haneda Excel is an otherwise typical and pleasant offering by the Tokyu Inn group. As part of the domestic terminal the transport connections are good and there is a range of food and retail outlets in the airport, connected shopping plaza and metro station below. Connection to the International terminal is via free airport shuttle bus from bus ranks outside terminal.

Room clean and fresh with view of airport but soundproofing was perfect - zero outside noise. Buffet Breakfast was good with a range of standard Japanese breakfast offerings and those odd Japanese versions of western breakfast buffet dishes.

The Hotel.
Check in was extremely quick and the staff very friendly. I had booked a Deluxe Single Room which was very big with plenty of space, bright and very clean. The bathroom was excellent with lots of space on the vanity and a long deep bath which is wonderful if you are 6’3”! The shower was incredibly soft and nice to boot. One thing I found really clever were charging points on the desk which was great; you didn’t have to go all over the room searching for them. Although the hotel was very busy, I never heard a thing all night. The air conditioning also worked very well and was very quiet. I left early the next morning so didn’t have the breakfast. 

The Location. The hotel forms part of Terminal 2 which is effectively the ANA Domestic terminal. There are free buses that run every couple of minutes from each terminal to the next which are located on the ground floor of each and well signposted. Travel time between terminals is around 5 minutes.

The rooms were modest in size, but really when getting off a long plane, all you need to do is have a shower and a bed to lie flat on. The beds were comfortable, the rooms clean, and the breakfast was good. Please note, when arriving internationally, you will need to make your way to the domestic terminal 2 or ANA terminal as this is where the hotel is located.

3,REDACTED,en,4443,"When arriving late into Tokyo or Japan for that matter your public transportation options are limited. Sometimes it's just better to stay the night at the airport hotel or hotel at the train station. In this case, I booked a hotel at one terminal while my travel partner arrived at another terminal. Normally this wouldn't be a problem during normal business hours. However, as it was a later arrival the free shuttle bus between the two terminals stopped running. And since this is Haneda airport you can't just walk between terminals. You have to take a taxi after hours which is extremely expensive for such a short ride! Not but 5 minutes drive between terminals cost between ¥1200 to ¥1500 (about ~$12 to $15 USD!).

However, that being said it is a very nice hotel at the airport. I chose this hotel for its convenience to the airport terminal proximity and public transportation. The other major plus is the choices of restaurants within the airport terminal. Your only difficult choice is how much you want to spend.

The room itself was a clean, modern style hotel room replete with what you'd normally find in a hotel room. The heated toilet seat and bidet functions were an unexpected bonus. But expect this for most all of Japan.

The staff was VERY friendly and polite. And spoke English very well. Kudos to them. And they take foreign credit cards which is a bonus when traveling overseas especially in Asian countries.

The breakfast buffet was a good mix between Japanese and Western style breakfast foods. You have to decide how much of it you want to truly eat and try before heading off for the day.

Are there other options to stay in Tokyo that's not as expensive? Of course. But if you're arriving late into Tokyo and the public transportation systems shut down (around 11pm and midnight), then this is a very good, nice clean, comfortable option. A bit pricey for sure, but a good option nonetheless.",4,2016/03/12

3,REDACTED,en,4447,"Its fairly typical for most Japanese hotels to cater to smokers. Its more than understandable since businessmen seem to smoke very often, however the hotel sold me a non smoking room when I made my reservation.

Yet when I arrived the room stunk of tobacco. So either the hotel allows smokers in non smoking rooms or they think that rooms can be both for smokers and non smokers. Terrible to put travelers into rooms that stink of poisonous tobacco.

When I complained the hard working staff's first solution was to spray room freshener ! Seriously ? Anyone with a pulse knows tobacco poisons, carpets, walls and our lungs, yet for this and many other hotels in Japan this is the solution.

To their credit when I refused the room freshener ""solution"", they found me a new room that did not stink of tobacco but the check in was delayed by 30 minutes I could have used to take a bath or relax.",2,2016/01/14
3,REDACTED,en,4448,"We booked this for our last night in Tokyo. 
Our flight home wasn't until midnight the next day, but proved very useful. Even though located in the Domestic terminal, very easy to get to the other terminals and International one as well. 
Room was by far the most spacious we had during our entire stay in Japan with a very modern bathroom and superb in room facilities.
We love aviation so naturally asked for a room overlooking the runway and we were not disappointed by what we got! 
We couldn't hear anything from outside the window, even when the bigger aircraft started up their engines. 
Staff were extremely courteous and many spoke English. 
The hotel also kept our luggage all day whilst we went into Tokyo for our last day which is very easy from the airport. 
Would certainly stay here again!",5,2016/01/14
3,REDACTED,en,4449,"We stayed here for one night on the way back to Singapore. Coming in on an All Nippon Airways domestic flight, we arrived at Terminal 2, which is where the hotel is.

Haneda Airport is kind enough to arrange for free shuttle buses to Terminal 1 as well as the International Terminal. At Terminal 2, the buses drop off and pick up at bus stop number 9 on level 1. The blue free shuttle goes only between Terminals 1 and 2 while the green buses includes the International Terminal. There is a different hotel at the International Terminal.

The rooms are clean and comfortable. Thankfully there's BBC News and DLife for English programming. Terminal 2 has plenty of dining (and shopping) choices if you decide to venture about.

Overall, the hotel is a great convenience for those that need it. However, do note that check out time is 11 am and time extensions will incur additional charges.",4,2016/01/01
3,REDACTED,en,4450,"This location will now be my premier choice when I visit Tokyo. The staff made checking in fast and simple-- even though my Japanese was elementary at best, the courteous staff always has someone on hand who can speak English, so you can be at ease. As for the rooms they are fairly small, but are a godsend if you just next a place to stay in between flights.If you're feeling famished there is a choice restaurant in the lobby. The monorail station is located on the bottom floor and is the gateway to the city of Tokyo from the airport. I personally recommend this hotel to any first time traveler to Tokyo. Happy travels!",4,2015/12/27
3,REDACTED,en,4451,"Excellent location. The hotel is situated in the domestic terminal at HND, but access to the other terminals is easy. 
Staff were friendly and helpful. 
Room was very spacious for Japanese standards, as was the bathroom. Nice quality amenities, too. Free wifi was stable and very fast.
I didn't eat in the hotel but the restaurant seemed busy and there is a room service option, too. 
Check out was simple and I was able to leave my luggage at the hotel as I was visiting Hiroshima for the day so was returning the same evening.
If you need a hotel for an early flight or late arriving flight, definitely book the Excel.",5,2015/12/21
3,REDACTED,en,4452,"I booked two non smoking rooms here, had a ANA connecting flight to Kushiro the following morning. I emailed the hotel prior to my arrival to enquire whether my parcel could be delivered and collected at the hotel upon checking in. Their reply was affirmative and they even provided a detailed information on how to get there from Narita airport. We took the limousine bus from Narita and arrived at Haneda Domestic Terminal 2 in about an hour and half or so. It was very easy to find the hotel. The check in was done with ease and we got our rooms in within minutes after check in procedure. The rooms were clean and tidy, everything we needed was provided, toiletries, pyjamas, towels and all the other normal amenities. We did not dine in their restaurant or use the laundry facilities. The next morning, we found a little cafe selling 500yen soba, it was delicious. A nice stroll after breakfast, we did some shopping at the airport, that is the benefit of staying at the airport, no hassle to get to the airport early in the morning. We enjoyed our morning in Haneda. Overall, we had a nice stay here. Fully recommend this hotel.",5,2015/12/15
3,REDACTED,en,4453,"I stayed at this hotel because of long layover in Tokyo on my way to Manila. It is located on the Domestic Terminal side of the airport and was pretty easy to find. The hotel room was probably the smallest I have ever stayed in. But I must say the room was clean and had all the amenities. If you forgot your hair brush, tooth brush, razor etc, they had it in the room. The room was adequate for what I needed. It was a little pricey though at around $141 per night. The buffet down stairs called Flyer's table was very pricey($20.00) but was the only eating place open that early. It was very Japanese oriented and I didn't recognize many of the dishes but again it was the only thing open. I would say overall the hotel is adequate for a quick layover place but that is it.",4,2015/12/10
3,REDACTED,en,4454,"Not a gorgeous one but enough useful for staying one night before my flight.

3,REDACTED,en,4456,"We stayed at this hotel on our way to Okinawa. We had a late night flight into Narita and then caught the Limosine Bus to Haneda airport, Terminal 2. The hotel is located about 50 m from the bus stop. The staff are excellent, helpful and friendly and understand English well. 
We had a late meal in their restaurant which was very nice and reasonably priced.
The room was comfortable with the planes outside the window, but we never heard one, as the rooms are well soundproofed. The bathroom wasn't huge but quite adequate.
We left early the next morning and walked straight into the terminal 2 and caught a shuttle to terminal 1, very quick, easy and free.",5,2015/11/13

Cost was reasonable for a airport hotel bt still quite expensive",4,2015/11/01
3,REDACTED,en,4458,"Hotel is extremely convenient to departure, shopping and restaurants in the Terminal 2. I do not feel it is a airport but seems like a little town with easy access. When you access to terminal 2 from the side door, it should be caution on time control for those shoppers when it was really killing time for shopping & eating there to make peoples forgot to catch up the boarding......",4,2015/10/29
3,REDACTED,en,4459,Hotels that are inside the airport or right next door are always expensive compared to even venturing just a short distance away. I was stuck in Tokyo overnight because snow in Sapporo stopped all inbound flights. Comfortable place to rest (and was free because of travel insurance). I'm not sure it would be worth the price because there are so many other cheaper and just as nice options only minutes away from HND.,4,2015/09/26
3,REDACTED,en,4460,"This hotel whilst located within Terminal 2 is an excellent location for the International Departures. Access from the city mono rail is fast and efficient to all three terminals.
A free shuttle bus is available between all three terminals. I arrived just under the official check in time of 2pm but was severed by a very pragmatic lady who checked me in as a room had become available. Highly recommend this stop over hotel.",5,2015/09/22
3,REDACTED,en,4461,"Arrived at Int'l Terminal at 10:45 PM and had a flight down to Ube/Yamaguchi at 7 AM. It was about midnight after immigration / customs. There is a short trip on the free airport shuttle and a short walk from the middle of the domestic terminal to the far end (use a free luggage cart). Friendly staff speaks little English but is very courteous and helpful. Single room is adequate for the short stay traveler. AC cools the room down in minutes. Free wifi is easy to log on. TV, clock/ radio, clothes iron and plenty of drawer/closet space. Toilet has an electric bidet. Bed and pillow are firm (just a tad softer than a tatami mat). Very clean. Efficient check out. The room and hotel are quiet as there are no late night flights from the domestic terminal. I was refreshed after a bed and shower. Price is right when you consider the time and taxi fare for any other hotel. This is the perfect hotel for a short layover.",5,2015/09/15
3,REDACTED,en,4462,"We booked the Excel for the night before our early morning return flight to London having found Haneda Airport an excellent choice to arrive and leave from Tokyo, Narita airport being some travelling distance away.

We had thought the Excel was just beside the International terminal but had not done enough research and found it to be attached to the Domestic terminal. Our fault, but not a problem as there are free busses between terminals and it only takes 5-8 minutes to transfer. 

The hotel entrance is on the departure floor on the far left, very easy to spot.

Quick check in, up to their 4th floor and along anonymous corridors to our room.

Surprisingly large room for Japan and the bonus was the amazing view over the airport and Tokyo Bay! Great fun to watch the planes taxiing against a background of differing sized sea vessels and ferries sailing around. No noise at all courtesy of large gap triple glazing.

Nice bathroom, good room facilities, all ok.

We went out that evening to find something to eat ( the hotel does have a restaurant but we like exploring menus!) and found the domestic terminal absolutely stuffed with little restaurants, to the point of it becoming an entertainment wandering along the balconies staring at what was on offer and what folks were tucking into.

Be aware that all the restaurants and cafes close sharply at 8pm!!! We neatly missed out on supper because of all the looking around!

Back to hotel and a very quiet night, early check out at 5pm was fine, wandered outside to get the trans terminal bus to the international terminal, 5 mins wait at bus stop, no problem.

Nice clean we'll run airport hotel with amazing access to all the restaurants and cafes. Quite happy to stay there again for early morning flights.",4,2015/08/31
3,REDACTED,en,4463,"My son and I stayed at the Haneda Excel Hotel at Haneda airport on a stopover on the way to Hokkaido. The hotel is very neat and tidy and the room, while small, was classically Japanese in its perfect efficiency. The staff was amazingly helpful, insisting on carrying our heavy ski bags up to our room for us. The food was very good and for an in-airport hotel the price was reasonable. My only point to note is its precise location: The hotel is located at the very end of a very, very long terminal and thus depending on where you arrive or depart, you could be in for a serious hike to and from this hotel. However, it still beats piling into a van for an off site hotel so I give this place a big recommend.",5,2015/08/24
3,REDACTED,en,4464,"Though slightly more expensive than many other hotels in Tokyo, this hotel was a pleasure to stay in. Big, comfortable rooms and friendly staff, obviously very ideally located inside the airport. It is located in the domestic terminal, but if you have an international flight there is a free shuttle bus that starts at 5am. Overall, a great visit.",5,2015/08/23
3,REDACTED,en,4465,"Stayed 5 nights here, and found hotel to be very clean, staff mostly very helpful and the location within the terminal excellent. 

It is pricey, so doesn't get 4 stars, but it is a very solid bet. 

Would have been good to have universal sockets, and cleaners often took a very long time to finish cleaning the room. Breakfast too was disappointing, and the 'card' system a bit of a bane.",3,2015/08/13
3,REDACTED,en,4466,"I, a lone female traveler, stayed here on my way to and from the World Scout Jamboree in Yamaguchi Japan. The people at the hotel were very helpful, even allowing me to store a couple of suitcases for the 2 weeks while I was at the Jamboree. It was amazingly quiet even though you are right there in the airport terminal. It could not have been more convenient. They bell staff even brought me an airport dolly when they came to pick up my luggage in the morning so I wouldn't have to find one. The food was great, and everything was perfect during my two stays there. I would not hesitate to stay there again. I would give them a six if I could!",5,2015/08/13
3,REDACTED,en,4467,"Room nice, very quiet considering it was in the airport, bed was very hard and pillows awful, but overall an OK stay. Right in the domestic terminal so really easy to find food and god for a little pre-home shop. Would use the hotel again.",4,2015/08/12

3,REDACTED,en,4469,"A wonderful stop on a very long journey. We had one night in this hotel and it was exactly what we needed. A place to sleep overnight between international flights. They have a wonderful breakfast buffet. The rooms are convenient, clean, quiet, efficient. 
The shuttle runs every 6 min making it a perfect place to stay if traveling through for a night",4,2015/07/01
3,REDACTED,en,4470,"This is a clean hotel (as are most hotels in Japan). It's linked to the airport and there're plenty of eateries/ restaurants and shops selling take away food and local products. If you need a drink, just go up to any of the many vending machines that hold a large variety of drinks, both non-alcohol and alcohol.
Rooms are neat and clean, though a little small. Not for a long stay, which is pretty obvious. Good enough for a night's stay during transit.",4,2015/06/29
3,REDACTED,en,4471,"We were happy with this hotel - once we found the entrance because we arrived very late and all the terminal was basically empty. Apparently there is a night entrance but we managed (after asking security guards) to find it. Room was clean and had everything you needed - nothing fantastic but fine. 
Had breakfast at hotel which was ok. 
Staff at reception were eager to please and helped with maps etc do the train system. 
Absolutely no noise from airport at all throughout our stay.",3,2015/06/26
3,REDACTED,en,4472,"I stayed here since I had a very early flight to Fukuoka (Departure at 6:20 am). It was very convenient, since I only needed approx. 2 min. after checking out the hotel. The room was not very big but enough for one person, and very comfortable.",4,2015/06/23
3,REDACTED,en,4473,Stopped here for one night as we had a late flight into Tokyo before starting a 3 week tour of Japan. Easy access from the International Airport via shuttle bus.

Easy walk to catch train into Tokyo.,4,2015/06/06
3,REDACTED,en,4474,"Everything was just fine with our overnight stay at the Haneda Excel Hotel Tokyo except our airline re-routed our flight so we arrived at the Haneda Airport just before midnight and our connecting flight didn't leave until the next day.

The Haneda Excel Hotel is actually in the Tokyo airport. I expected second rate accommodations, mediocre service, and highway robbery prices. We got none of that.

The Haneda Excel provided luxury accommodations and superb service at a non-exorbitant cost.

If you are stranded in Haneda, a stay at the Haneda Excel Hotel is a good respite.",4,2015/06/03
3,REDACTED,en,4475,"For a airport hotel I was most impressed with the Haneda Excel at the Domestic Terminal 2. Rooms were extremely comfortable, quiet & spacious. The staff were very helpful. Although there is plenty of choice to eat in the airport I ate in the hotel which I didn't find over priced although it can be cheaper to eat elsewhere but we were also given vouchers for 10% off.
There is a free shuttle bus to the International Terminal which goes frequently & only takes about 10/15 minutes. Breakfast was also good.",4,2015/05/20
3,REDACTED,en,4476,"Stayed here a couple weeks ago after a late night arrival and long international flight. 

PROS: 
1. Convenient location, especially if you are located in Domestic Terminal #2. Otherwise shuttle from International Terminal is 10-15 minutes with a 500+ meter walk upstairs to the end ot the domestic terminal. The free airport shuttle is easily identified and / or the terminal information booth can direct you to the proper area. This information booth is immediately outside as you exit the ""immigration"" area...and so are the shuttle bus stops.

2. The domestic terminal 2 is filled with shops and restaurants (although closed if you have a late arrival).

3. Did not have a problem with communication and service at check in/out.

4. Rooms clean but small and slightly ""dated""...overall ""average"" in general appearances.

As other reviews stated, this is not by any means a Five Star Hotel. The main benefit is its convenience but you can also find free shuttles to nearby comparable hotels in the area for half the price (if that is the issue). If you are there just for a basic overnight rest, then it would be just as (or more) convenient to find these. If you are transferring to a domestic flight, then the Haneda hotel will be the one for you.",3,2015/04/30
3,REDACTED,en,4477,"I was coming late to Tokyo Haneda airport and flying early morning. The hotel is inside the airport terminal 2, so I did not have to stress as to get a shuttle or a bus early morning and to lose time because of my poor Japanese reading and speaking skills. They have a diner place, internet access and their rate is reasonable especially considering the location. Be aware that there are few if any signs to indicate the hotel location but if you are going to terminal 2, 2nd floor just after check-in A you cannot miss it.",4,2015/04/26
3,REDACTED,en,4478,"Very close to the airport. Second time we have used it when traveling with 12-20 high school students from the US. Clean, quiet, and a good breakfast buffet. Helpful staff and easy access to money exchange, gift shops, and terminal 2 when catching connecting flights elsewhere in Japan.",5,2015/04/17
3,REDACTED,en,4479,"Stayed here one night while we had an overnight layover on our way down to Fukuoka. After a late night arrival, I prepared myself to be woken up early as our room directly faced the Tarmac. I was pleasantly surprised when I woke up at 7:30am and it was still really quiet. I looked out the window and was shocked to see airplanes taking off and trucks all over- and I could not hear them at all! The windows are double paned and are very well insulated.

The hotel was really nice and the showers were amazing. Even my 14 year old nephew commented on how nice the shower was. Be prepared for hard mattresses in Japan. No heavenly beds in this country.",5,2015/04/05
3,REDACTED,en,4480,"We arrived late into Haneda and had an early domestic flight the next day. The hotel is in Terminal 2 (domestic) and a 10 minute shuttle ride from the international terminal. It's a long haul form the shuttle drop-off all the way down terminal 2 to the hotel entrance, but it was great to be already at the terminal the next morning.
Staff was helpful. Rooms are small and beds firm, but this hotel is all about convenience and worth it if you have a quick overnight stay and do not want to go all the way into Tokyo",4,2015/03/28
3,REDACTED,en,4481,"easy bus access to international terminal. We had a very good evening meal in restaurant. Room was large clean & comfortable, though bed very hard. Breakfast was buffet with plenty of choice. Room was quiet given its location. Would recommend as an airport hotel.",4,2015/03/20
3,REDACTED,en,4482,"I stayed at this property for one night after landing in the evening and having another early morning flight out. My expectations were lowered by some of the other reviews; however, the property was a very nice place and exactly what I needed (it’s obviously not a five star hotel, nor is it billed as one). Some more details:

Location - The hotel is attached to T2 (domestic - used mostly by ANA) and is easy to find. There is a free bus that will take you to the other terminals (T1, which is used mostly by JAL and the International Terminal). It runs frequently and is signposted.

Service - The service was great and the staff spoke good English. I asked for a larger bed ahead of checking in (I had booked a room with a single) and they gave me a free upgrade. 

Room - The room I ended up staying in, which had a double bed, was a good size, modern, clean and comfortable for a one night stay in an airport. There is free Wi-Fi as well - the code can be accessed by turning on the TV (I am not sure why there have been some complaints about this because its very easy to find / navigate). 

Other points - There is room service, though I didn't order anything. The airport has several restaurants and convenience stores (some of which close around 9/10 pm, others that stay open a bit later; these are located by the monorail entrance). There is also a restaurant in the hotel, right off of reception. It seemed to be open late.

In the end, I would stay again if I needed a hotel by Haneda. It beat having to leave the airport and go to a hotel in the city just to turn around again to make a flight in the morning. I thought the price was also reasonable.",4,2015/03/07
3,REDACTED,en,4483,"I stayed here for one. I was flying in and out of the international terminal, I will probably try the other hotel next time since that one is at the international terminal. The Haneda Excel is quite convenient to terminal 2 domestic terminal and I had a nice walk in the morning in the terminal which is very nice. I should have gone out there for breakfast but I didn't realize it was open already at 5 am when I was hungry! 

For the hotel: The front desk is nice and efficient. The restaurant is quite cafeteria like and expensive. The rooms are very plain, but do have what you need. The hallway did smell smoky and the carpet needed to be clean. They do provide everything you need if you don't have your luggage, even PJs.",3,2015/03/03
3,REDACTED,en,4484,"This hotel is very clean and conveniently located at the second floor of Terminal 2 in Haneda Airport. The staff are super friendly which is not unusual in Japan. The bell boy who took us in the room explained where we can get our food, the vending machines, ice machines, etc. Room is spacious for two people... it has a queen size bed with necessary amenities available we needed during the stay. The toilet has a bidet with seat warmer. There are tea, coffee, small pot to heat the water for hot drinks, and a small refrigerator but there's no microwave to heat the food. However, there are many restaurants located in the same building with wide range of selections. Wi-Fi is free... either wireless or connected by a cable. The price is average for this area but with its convenient location, I would highly recommend this hotel especially for those in transit in the area or waiting for their next flight.",5,2015/03/01
3,REDACTED,en,4485,"This hotel is actually on the 2nd floor of the domestic terminal at Haneda, so location is key. We arrived around 10 p.m. into Haneda and didn't even have to leave the building to get to the hotel. We were starving so incredibly grateful that their restaurant was open past midnight. Food at the restaurant was just fine. Nothing amazing but did the trick. Surprisingly busy for how late it was. Service was good, and they were very gracious to upgrade us to a room with more beds once they saw our party was larger. Lobby/common areas are all good. The room was just o.k. 4 twin beds all sort of crammed in there with a little sofa. Very small bathroom but usable. It just didn't feel terribly clean and everything felt a little dark. But I think this is a fine choice if you have a layover and don't want to bother getting into Tokyo proper. I think we would have actually jumped into a cab to a hotel in Tokyo since there are some that are fairly close, but we had a lot of luggage so didn't want the hassle. We took a shuttle to the international terminal the next morning which was pretty easy. All-in-all, perfectly serviceable for a transit hotel in the airport, but don't expect luxury or any frills!",3,2015/02/20

3,REDACTED,en,4487,The hotel is conveniently located in Terminal 2 which makes it convenient for domestic flight the next morning. It is just average hotel. The room was small.

3,REDACTED,en,4489,"Not much to add here as previous reviewers have covered all the basics. Good staff, modern rooms and conveniently located inside Haneda Terminal 2. I do recommend joining the Tokyu Hoteis members club as this will open up cheaper rates. I got a bed and breakfast single rate for 13,500 yen. I was upgraded to a Comfort Room upon check in which had an amazing massage chair in the room. Club members also receive a complimentary newspaper (English or Japanese). I enjoyed the breakfast which is buffet style served in a bright and spacious restaurant. A full range of Japanese and Westerm options. I had a flight from the international terminal and I took the free shuttle bus between terminals. Allow 15 minutes for the transfer. My first choice from now on when I have an overnight stop for a flight.",5,2015/01/05
3,REDACTED,en,4490,"This hotel is in the ANA domestic terminal (terminal 2) at Haneda Airport. Besides the convenient location, the rooms are reasonably large, have internet connection and nice bathrooms (not the all-in-one compartment). It has a restaurant (fairly expensive) connected BUT you have direct access to the various airport restaurants and shops so you can find cheaper fare. I had a 7:30 AM departure so I was able to get up at about 5:30, check out around 6:00, walk underground to the JAL terminal and check-in, and have breakfast before my flight (no early morning buses or trains to get to the airport). The biggest drawback I saw was that the room rate I was quoted did not include the service charge, consumption tax, or accommodation tax (mine totaled about $20.00).",4,2014/12/30

International airport has better choices for dinner venues so the free shuttle comes in handy here too.

3,REDACTED,en,4493,"I stayed at the Haneda Excel Tokyu last week following a concert in the city and an early departure the next morning. The location of the hotel is unquestionably its main attraction. It's at the A end of Terminal 2. The entrance/exit is about 20 meters from ANA's baggage check-in. The room itself was fine, nothing memorable, but fine. My room was comfortable, an end room, and was quiet given the proximity to the runways. The only real problem I had in the hotel was getting the wifi information. Normally, this is given at check-in along with the card key. But, not at this hotel. I noticed this when I got to my room. So, I checked the services directory which told me to call the front desk, which I did. The front desk told me to turn on my television to find the information. Sorry, Tokyu Excel, just give it to me at check-in like every other good hotel does and don't make me go searching for the information. I don't watch TV. That minor frustration aside, the hotel was fine and I will stay here again when I have an early flight.",4,2014/12/08
3,REDACTED,en,4494,"Hotel adjacent to the terminal 2, it took me 10 mins from my room to the ANA lounge in terminal 2.

After arriving shortly after 10pm at Haneda airport, this hotel was ideal location for traveling next morning from the same airport.

Short free shuttle bus ride from international terminal to the terminal 2, you will be in your room in no time.

Check in was very smooth, be sure to ask for user name and password for free wifi.

Room was very small, typical Japanese business hotel. Bed is also Japanese typical hard bed. They have a humidifier/purifier in a room and helped me sleep better with clean air. They had two pillows, foam and feathers. I kept switching my pillow every time I woke up.

I ordered room service breakfast and it was really good. Japanese traditional style.

Overall, this hotel gave me what I needed after my long flight. Now I am ready to take another flight.",4,2014/12/07
3,REDACTED,en,4495,"Stayed here 2 weeks. Clean comfortable accommodation. Located at the end of Terminal 2. Good sized rooms. Friendly and helpful staff. Most speak good English. The hotel is quiet and provides a good breakfast. There are buses, taxis and a train station all close to the hotel. 

I would stay here again.",4,2014/12/03
3,REDACTED,en,4496,"We had a 23 hour layover in Tokyo and had arranged for a 4 hour city tour...landing late at night from Hanoi we were looking for a Hotel in Airport that was reasonable price so we could sleep, get up and take tour and then back to airport to continue our journey...
Hotel was clean, spacious rooms, good electronic connections (wifi, TV etc) and the service very good...we had an interesting view right out onto the runway at Terminal 2 and could watch planes land and take off...
We ordered simple room service and it was OK (again as expected), came quickly and good service...we also had lunch in the hotel restaurant after our tour the next day...the experience was not as good, the food was only OK and the service was slow...
overall it was what we were looking for at a reasonable price for Tokyo...",4,2014/11/15
3,REDACTED,en,4497,"Spent one very short night here. Had a 18 hour connection on route to Hanoi from Toronto!
Had a room facing the runway! Really neat! Room was actually really nice! Great bed, great pillows, great Sleep! 
Enough that just this quick stop through, and we would like to go back to Tokyo!",4,2014/11/10
3,REDACTED,en,4498,"Arrived late at night at Haneda, took the free shuttle to the domestic terminal. The Haneda Excel Hotel was right off the main area. Was efficiently checked in and my luggage taken to my room, had a nice night's sleep on the (typically Japanese) hard bed, and in the morning was given a luggage cart to transport my luggage to the United check in. All very easy. The room was small but comfortable and clean. Will use this hotel again when the need arises.",5,2014/11/08
3,REDACTED,en,4499,"Quick layover in Haneda. Great hotel for this kind of stop. Easy bus free inter-terminal bus shuttle. Last bus is at midnight I recall and the airports in Japan tend to shut down completely after midnight. Hotel is located in Domestic Terminal 2.
Friendly English speaking staff. Rooms are small but very clean. Bed good. Everything you need for an airport layover.",4,2014/10/30
3,REDACTED,en,4500,"Friendly and efficient English speaking staff, convenient location relative to the airport shuttle buses, comfortable beds with pleasant room décor, and the heated toilet with the water jets is definitely a unique new experience for Western travelers! Breakfast buffet is tasty and has a good variety of selections.",5,2014/10/21
3,REDACTED,en,4501,"We stayed at the Haneda Excel for one night between flights. We had a twin-bedded room because all the doubles were sold out. 
What we liked:
The bedroom and bathroom were larger than expected, with a modern, functional décor. The room was clean and comfortable. 
We had seen some comments about the comfort of the beds, but we slept quite well. There was also little noise from the airport. 
Convenient location – if you fly into the international terminal, you’ll need to take the shuttle bus around to the domestic terminal. Because it’s located at the end of the terminal, there is a good selection of restaurants and convenience stores to buy food and drink. 
All the typical amenities found in a Japanese hotel (an array of toiletries, robes, etc.).
Things that weren’t as great:
It was a bit overpriced for the standard of accommodation compared to other hotels we stayed in while in Japan.
We arrived about 9.00 after an eleven hour flight and had hoped to get into our room early so we could rest and do some sight-seeing later in the afternoon. The staff did let us check in about an hour early (c13.00), but by that time we were too tired to go explore Tokyo. 
Overall
The hotel was really convenient for flying in and out of Haneda Airport. We had a comfortable stay, and would consider staying again.",4,2014/10/17
3,REDACTED,en,4502,"Pros: • Conveniently located inside the airport terminal • Clean room with well-stocked toiletries • Good customer service Cons: • The bed is a bit on the firm side and the room lacks any kind of welcoming feel, but it's to be expected for airport hotel",4,2014/10/14
3,REDACTED,en,4503,"As I was flying in to Haneda Airport after a long flight from Canada, I wanted a nice place to stay and rest for one night. This clean and efficient hotel definitely met my needs. Even my Japan-Wireless wi-fi router was delivered to me immediately upon arrival. Efficient, clean and friendly hotel. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2014/10/10
3,REDACTED,en,4504,"Midnight following long flights, a free shuttle bus brought us to terminal 2. Exhausted, our party ambled past endless abandoned ticket counters which seemed to symbolize potential misfortune. We approached the end of the building to find many eager staff members welcoming us. The staff leapt into action, taking our bags and ushering us to the desk where the gentleman seemed delighted that we had arrived. In short measure we were registered and another young man loaded our bags to take us to our rooms. His ""SELF TAUGHT"" English skills were remarkable. He graciously answered questions and showed us the features of the clean, fully appointed comfortable room.
The one regret is that we have only one night to stay in this comfortable conveinent Hotel.",5,2014/10/01
3,REDACTED,en,4505,We had one night stop-over before connecting to our flight to Chitose. This hotel is extremely convenient for this. It was also very comfortable and the room was large. A large variety of food is easily available along the airport concourse.,4,2014/09/28
3,REDACTED,en,4506,"This is THE hotel for Haneda as it is adjacent to and accessible from Terminal 2. In our case, we had a morning flight from Haneda to Seoul and I am always all in favor of minimizing morning hassle. So we stayed at this hotel and it turned out to be a good move.

We arrived at the hotel at about 12:30 and checked our bags until check-in time at 2 PM. We wandered out into Terminal 2 to find a place for lunch as there were plenty of choices. When we returned, we were checked in quickly and shown to our rooms. The accommodations were quite clean as I have come to expect in Japan but they were also reasonably spacious, particularly for a Japanese hotel. I used the WiFi while I was there at no charge. It worked relatively well. All of the room amenities were also stocked and everything was in working order. I should also note that the room was quiet and the bed was comfortable allowing me a good night's sleep.

Breakfast was not included in the room rate but I decided in the morning to eat at the hotel restaurant. The buffet was adequate but nothing more than that. For the charge (just less than ¥2400), it was a little sparse in my opinion compared to others I have seen for similar prices.

Check out proceeded smoothly and we were able to get to the International Terminal from T2 by bus in about 15 minutes after leaving the hotel. This convenience combined with the reasonably good accommodations made this worth the price (about ¥17,000 plus service charge of 10% and tax). 

If you have an early flight from Haneda or a late flight into Haneda, you may want to consider staying at this establishment. The accommodations are more than adequate, the staff members are polite and helpful and you cannot beat the convenience. My only suggestion would be to make alternate arrangements for breakfast if possible as it's really not a great value proposition, though it will do if you have no other easy choice.",4,2014/09/27
3,REDACTED,en,4507,"We arrived at Haneda an hour before midnight. The Excel hotel is integrated into Terminal 2. No taxi ride necessary (just a free of charge transfer from the intern. arrival to T2.) Very nice hotel, large enough rooms, no airport noise. The nearby restaurant serves until after midnight. Breakfast next morning was very good, a large variety of food. 
All in all: Just the right stop after a long flight.",5,2014/09/21
3,REDACTED,en,4508,"Our travel agent booked us into this hotel for two nights before our cruise out of Yokohama.
We landed at the Haneda International Airport (Tokyo) very late at night.
Free shuttle bus to the Domestic Airport and the hotel is situated on the 2nd floor.
Nice clean hotel, good service, rooms are very nice with all bathroom consumables and hair dryer.
Dressing gowns, slippers both disposable and leather.
Beautiful bathroom with bath and shower, Bidet toilet seat.
The location is so handy to both the domestic and international airports with free shuttle buses operating every 4-6 minutes between them both.
The train stations and mono rail also operate from the same building with multiple food and convenience stores and restaurants on many levels.",4,2014/09/20
3,REDACTED,en,4509,Seeing as this hotel is built directly onto the airport it's the best choice after a long journey. The staff are helpful and the food has a good selection. The room it's simple but sufficient. The bed was a little hard but still comfortable. Most surprising for a hotel in an airport is the fact that I heard no plane noise at all. Would recommend.,4,2014/09/19
3,REDACTED,en,4510,"Hotel conveniently located in Haneda airport for flights. Allow time if you need to change terminal for international flights etc on free bus, this hotel was available to be booked when the city hotels were all booked up.

Comfortably large room, with free internet access, mini bar, tea and coffee.",4,2014/08/16
3,REDACTED,en,4511,"I chose this hotel because it is in Haneda Airport. I flew into Narita from NZ and needed to catch a connecting flight the next day from Haneda, so this was a logical choice. Clean, efficient, spacious, but not cheap.",4,2014/08/10
3,REDACTED,en,4512,"When I fly into Japan I come into Narita Airport and my next day flight is elsewhere in Japan which means I need to fly out of Hanada Airport. There is a shuttle bus from Narita to Haneda, takes about an hour. By terminal 2 at Haneda you will find the hotel. The staff is friendly and helpful. My room had two queens and was big enough. The beds are hard , but it is usual for Japan. You are given slippers and a robe and the bathroom is nice. I ate dinner at the Hotel restaurant called the Flyers Table. I just discovered that in the room are coupons discounting some food in the restaurant. The food was nice and the atmosphere was peaceful and pretty",4,2014/08/06
3,REDACTED,en,4513,"Stayed in this hotel for a night so as to catch an early morning flight. The hotel is located in the Domestic Terminal which is a short shuttle bus ride away from the Haneda International Terminal. The shops in the terminal closes early at around 8pm. The next morning as we have the time, took a walk around the terminal and noticed lots of shops and eateries in the terminal. Room is clean and usual amenities are provided. Our room's window overlook the check in counters of the terminal which is a first for me. A good spread for morning buffet breakfast. Not sure about room rates as stay was part of package tour.",4,2014/07/23
3,REDACTED,en,4514,"Got stuck at Haneda for one night so I really only slept here. It is the only option that is actually in the airport itself, so makes it super convenient but also pricey. Almost twice the price of nearby hotels, but no shuttle involved.
Modern clean, comfortable rooms and actually on the larger size for Japan. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the price.",4,2014/06/27
3,REDACTED,en,4515,"After clearing immigration and getting our luggages, it was well past midniight. The train services do not run after midnight so this hotel , situated at the end of terminal 2 Haneda airport , is a welcome relief. We took the free shuttle service from the international terminal and a guard on duty showed us the way to the hotel. The room is not too small, cosy , clean and well equipped. We also enjoy the buffet breakfast, starting at 5 am. Again , this is a plus point for travellers who have an early flight to catch.",5,2014/06/25
3,REDACTED,en,4516,"Right at the end of terminal 2 , so very easy to find, in the terminal there are several shops for one nights requirements. Rooms are a good size and quiet. We had an early flight from the international terminal and caught the 03.50 (free )shuttle from the hotel, which left exactly on time. We felt that the hotel was a little on the expensive side , but I guess you pay for the convenience. I would use it again if ness.",4,2014/06/14
3,REDACTED,en,4517,"Stayed here prior to an early flight back to the UK and found the hotel to be well situated in the Domestic terminal 2 at Haneda. An easy feee shuttle bus to the International terminal departs from bust stop 9 on the level beneath the hotel. Takes 10 mins and departs at 30 minute intervals (x.50 or x.20 past the hour). The hotel itself is clean, modern and had great staff. Fantastic wifi. Rooms are more than adequate for a short stay. I agree bed slightly hard but not a problem for 1 night. Breakfast buffet in Flyers restaurant good - starts at 5 am. A fantastic choice of restaurants in the terminal - I had a superb sashimi board. Will stay again.",4,2014/06/08
3,REDACTED,en,4518,"The hotel is easily found from Terminal 2 at Haneda Airport, the staff are warm and welcoming on arrival and the rooms are of a reasonable size and spotlessly clean. The hotel is also well sound-proofed. The restaurant service is good, and the menu choice is excellent for a hotel restaurant.

The main purpose of a hotel must be to provide a bed for the night. Unfortunately the beds in our room at this hotel were rock hard. There was no give in the mattresses and sleeping on the bed was as uncomfortable as lying on the floor. It proved very difficult to sleep on such hard mattresses.",2,2014/06/04
3,REDACTED,en,4519,"Traveling alone to Tokyo for the first time, I decided to stay at the airport the night I got in, as my arrival was after 10 p.m. and didn't know how long immigration/customs would take and JR Rail Pass exchange office was going to be closed. After a long flight, just wanted to regroup and figure it all out in the morning. Took the free shuttle from Terminal 1 (international) to Terminal 2. You just go up the 2F stairs and go all the way to the left--hotel is right in the terminal. Super clean and with every little touch--sleepwear (kimono), slippers, brush, toothbrush, toothpaste--even a little elastic band for getting long hair out of the way when washing your face. Kettle for hot water/coffee/tea. Very comfortable bed with two kinds of pillow. Could not have been more pleased.

3,REDACTED,en,4521,"we always stay at this hotel when we use an early international flight. very convenient as it is located @terminal 2. good size rooms, friendly staff. the only downside is they don't have their own shuttle bus to go to the other terminals (you have to rely on public shuttle bus) which could be a nightmare for those who have lots of suitcases... still recommended.",4,2014/05/08
3,REDACTED,en,4522,"We stayed at the hotel for one night whilst in transit between Tokyo Haneda Int airport & London.
Hotel next to domestic airport terminal 2 & not the International terminal. Easily reached with free shuttle bus from outside international terminal & a short walk through terminal directly into hotel reception. As usual, (as with the Japanese hotels that we have stayed in to date) , the hotel is clean & has everything for weary travellers to rest their heads. The rooms have a good selection of toiletries, tea/coffee making facilities & a hairdryer.
The beds were very hard for us, but we did manage a few hours sleep. 
Although fire exits were pointed out upon checking in, what to do in the event of an earthquake was not explained & when we experienced our first earthquake early on the day of departure, we really didn't know what we should have done. I know that earthquakes are regular occurrences in Japan & Japanese people know exactly what to do, it can be a frightening experience for those not used to them. Perhaps all Japanese hoteliers need to put a note in all hotel rooms (on back of door) explaining what to do in such circumstances?",4,2014/05/05
3,REDACTED,en,4523,"Stayed here when arriving late at night into Haneda. The airport terminal itself was closed, but the hotel was a light at the end. Wonderful staff and a quiet place to get some rest for the next day. Rooms were small, but very functional. Don't really need more just to get some rest.",4,2014/04/15

The rooms are sound-proofed (you don't hear any airplane noise at all), very clean, bed is comfortable, and have plenty of bathroom amenities, movies in English, bathrobe and slippers. The basic room is a bit on the small side, ok for one person, would be cramped for two. 
There is a restaurant and room service, but there are also many different restaurants (cafes, italian, japanese...) and shops in the terminal within a 5 minute walk. 
The staff is very polite and helpful (very typical of Japanese). 
For an over night stay, in between connecting flights, this is a perfect hotel.",4,2014/04/15
3,REDACTED,en,4525,"I arrived at Narita late and had a morning flight from Haneda. I debated myself if I should stay in the central Tokyo or the airport hotel close to Haneda Airport. My choice was right !!
There is non stop bus service from Narita and this hotel is connected to the Terminal 2 of the airport. The hotel room is spacious in Japanese standard and sound proof was perfect. All facilities satisfy the needs of business travelers such as iron for pressing suits and internet connection. In addition, there was a small refrigerator and the price was very reasonable.Next day, the hotel to airplane door seat took me just 15 minutes ! Please note if you domestic flight departs from terminal 1or international terminal, you need to add more time. I am totally satisfied.",5,2014/03/13
3,REDACTED,en,4526,"We stayed here for one night when we were stuck in Tokyo due to bad weather. Hotel is right in terminal 2 (ANA terminal). The train stops right at the terminal. Great service with free WIFI in rooms. Rooms are pretty good size for Japan. There is a good restaurant at the hotel or just step into the terminal to access the restuarants and cafes there. You can take the shuttle to terminal 1 (JAL) or it's a 10 minute walk. I would rank this higher than the JAL Haneda hotel, in terms of size, room quality and, of course, location.",4,2014/03/08
3,REDACTED,en,4527,"The convinence of Excel Hotel Tokyu is second to none. Location is central, terminal 2, with buses ever 10 min to all terminals. Standard of accommodation is high. Great sleeping quality. Will stay at this hotel again if flying out f Haneda.",5,2014/02/27

The room was western style but they had to be the hardest mattresses and it was not very comfortable. For a western style hotel you would expect better quality. 
The restaurant was very good and we had excellent food, western style although Japanese was available. We eat both dinner and breakfast in the hotel.
If I go back to Japan and need an airport hotel I would probably try and find an alternative as I stayed at Nikko Narita and this was much better.",3,2014/02/23
3,REDACTED,en,4529,"Let's face it. If you're staying at Haneda it's a convenience choice. This place couldn't be better located. You walk out of the lobby into the Terminal 2 check-in area. The check-in counter for Air Do (which we were flying this time) was about 5 meters away from the hotel door... we thought we were running late until we realized where we were! 

The hotel itself is a stock standard Japanese business hotel. Service was very good - formal and extremely polite/helpful. The hotel interior was a bit aged and pretty ordinary - no personality, colour or charisma to speak of at all - the definition of bland. We were upgraded into one of their best rooms and it was spacious but nothing flash. Nice view onto the tarmac though - it's not everyday that you look out the window to see an aircraft stowing just meters away!",4,2014/02/15
3,REDACTED,en,4530,Very convenient hotel attached to Haneda Terminal 2 (ANA terminal). Fantastic staff service. Reasonable size rooms for Japanese hotels. Nice restaurant though the actual restaurant shuts about 11pm and then meals are served in the bar (not a major issue except the smoking & non-smoking areas are in close proximity). Breakfast buffet has a good choice.,5,2014/02/06
3,REDACTED,en,4531,"Stayed one night in Jan 2014. The hotel is directly and conveniently connected to Haneda Terminal 2 which is accessible by the free shuttle bus from Terminal 1 and International Terminal. The Tokyo Monorail is available from Terminal 2 and connects to other local and Japan Rail system. Typical Japanese hotel size rooms but good for an over night stay or business stay. Free left luggage facility was provided. The hotel restaurant serves good food and one can always walk into the terminal and try the eatries there. Hotel staff very courteous and attentive, unlike busy hotels at a terminal. Free internet in rooms and lobby.",4,2014/01/16
3,REDACTED,en,4532,"We flew into Haneda late at night and have a domestic flight (ANA) to catch early next morning. We had to take a free shuttle bus from the international terminal to the hotel, which is located at Terminal 2 (ANA gates). The check-in was smooth and efficient, and my request for connecting rooms (conveyed online during reservation) was attended to. 

The rooms were average size but modern. We had supper at the restaurant. Food was good but a little expensive. 

It was very convenient the next morning to simply take the lifts down to the check in gates for our ANA domestic flight to Sapporo. If you are flying JAL domestic flights you will have to take the shuttle bus to Terminal 1. The only drawback was the hotel was approximately US$200 a night, so its not cheap for a 7hour overnight stay.",4,2014/01/06
3,REDACTED,en,4533,"Hotel is very nice. Rooms are relatively big (for Japanese standards) and very clean, like most hotels in Japan. Great view of the tarmac, and the hotel is connected to the terminal (but NOT the international terminal). Staff at the restaurant (went there for dinner) are not too friendly, maybe they are tired from the high numbers of different tourist every day...? Again, hotel is nice, but prices are not cheap at all in the restaurant or for the rooms. Price paid was expensive, and it did not even included breakfast. Quality of breakfast was o.k, but nothing to hold your breath for...",3,2013/12/19
3,REDACTED,en,4534,"This hotel is located in the domestic terminal at Haneda airport. It is very convenient if you need to spend the night before taking a flight. The rooms are modern and spacious for Japan. The wifi is free and fast. 

The downside is that they will NOT do early check-ins before 2 and will charge extra for any time past the 11 am checkout time.",4,2013/12/17
3,REDACTED,en,4535,"About the only thing that recommends this hotel is its location right at the airport. The room was very small, with only a double bed. The bath was tiny and cramped. Unlike many international airport hotels, checkout time is not 24 hours after arrival, but 11 a.m., even if you arrive late at night. If you want to extend your stay beyond 11 (for example, if your next flight is not until after midnight), you will be asked to pay from 25% to 100% of the daily room rate, depending on the number of hours extended. The food is poor and expensive. The TV channel selection is particularly poor for an international clientele. Of the 9 hotels we stayed in during a 3+ week trip in Asia, this was by far the worst.

On the good news side, the staff are friendly and helpful, with basic English skills. The hotel is clean, and the wifi is free.

But our bottom line is: Poor value for the money, compared with just about any other international airport hotel in the world. Shame on you, Haneda Excel!",2,2013/12/15
3,REDACTED,en,4536,"I had to switch airports for my connecting flight, so had to overnight in Haneda. Airport bus from Narita takes you staight to the terminal where the hotel is located. There is a free bus at around 4am which takes you to the international terminal.",4,2013/12/14
3,REDACTED,en,4537,"I booked two rooms for me and a few mates who had come to Japan for an event. We needed a hotel close to airport in which we were arriving (Haneda) and this was by far the closest in the area.Please note, If you arrive into Haneda International, GOOGLE how to use the train system; We had to hire two cars and cost about $25aud each cab to go from Haneda International to the Domestic terminal in which Haneda Excel is located.

The staff were friendly, The place was clean, Very happy when we first rolled in. They were happy to give us all different wifi accounts for free. Then we got to the rooms; Plenty of room, Very tidy, Wifi signal was awesome, beds were comfy, We were thrilled to be treated like kings for just that one night. They have vending machines on all floors with beer (Yippee!) and light snacks. Only downfall was the room service; They close around 11pm from memory. Bathrooms had heaps of room, And plenty of shampoo/body wash etc.

None the less, GREAT hotel to stay at, Cheap too.. Very happy!",5,2013/11/29
3,REDACTED,en,4538,Had an overnight transit stay at this hotel. The hotel itself is directly linked to Terminal 2 at Haneda Airport which primarily services ANA. Terminal 1 which primarily services JAL is linked via an underground walkway about a 15 minute walk from Terminal 2. The staff are efficient and courteous in typical Japanese style. Our standard room was of comparable size to a western hotel although the bathroom was smaller. Room was equipped with all the standard amenities and spotlessly clean. Free wi fi is available. There were lots of eating options in the terminal itself in addition to the standard hotel fare and transportation to Tokyo CBD is about 30 minutes by train. Our room overlooked one of the airport runways which was an interesting diversion. Surprisingly despite this there was absolutely no airport noise at all. In the room the air con and refrigerator too were deadly quiet. Would recommend this hotel to anyone needing a transit stop through Haneda,4,2013/11/12

3,REDACTED,en,4541,"With a 6.25 am flight out of Haneda to London and then Rome it made sense to stay at a hotel at the airport. The Excel is good from that perspective, the Monorail goes direct to the terminals from Tokyo and you need to get off at Terminal 2. The International terminal is Terminal 1. The Excel is at the end of terminal 2 and is like an oasis at the end of chaos. The check staff were friendly and provided all the information we required for our early start the next morning. The free shuttle to Terminal 1 is not exclusive to the hotel and the Excel is the last pickup, so don't be late and be prepared to stand with your luggage. There are heaps of restaurants on four levels of the terminal, but a word of advice, around 6.00 pm to 7.00 pm they get very busy and you see lines of people waiting to get in. 
The room we had was relatively small but for an overnight stay it was fine. As others have said you can be entertained by the airport activity from your window overlooking the runways.
All in all a good hotel as a convenient transit stop.",5,2013/10/15
3,REDACTED,en,4542,"The rooms look over the runway, but you can't hear the planes at all.

The room provides essential hotel needs, is clean, with efficient air con and noise insulation, big screen, two queen beds and a competitive price. It also offers direct access to the many restaurants and shops on the land side of the check in building. You can also do advance check-in for your boarding cards in the hotel reception.

3,REDACTED,en,4546,"I stayed at this hotel as my flight was canceled. The room was big enough to move around and to my surprise it was very well lit. Hotels in Japan tend to be under-lit. Also, it is quite convenient as it is connected to T1 and the International Terminal (the hotel is at T2) by a free shuttle that passes every five to ten minutes. 

Much better than sleeping on a bench waiting for your early morning flight.",3,2013/09/12
3,REDACTED,en,4547,"Used this place as on overnight stop to connect from an internal flight in Japan to an early flight back to Europe the next day. The hotel sells itself on location, and if you fly in and out of T2 then this is true. However, we flew into T1 and out of the international terminal. From T1 to the hotel takes about 15-20 min using a mixture of moving walkways and escalators. Not too bad. However, trying to catch an early morning international flight is much harder. The airport monorail does not begin operating before our final check in time and while hotel does run early shuttle buses, these are on a first come, first served basis and were at times that did not suit our flight. Therefore we ended up getting a taxi from the hotel to the international terminal - which at a shade over ¥2000 should also be calculated into your travel plans.

The hotel itself is fine. The rooms are a good size, are comfy and contain all of the amenities that you would expect from an airport hotel.

Early morning international flights from Haneda are not really right. The relative lack of public transport at that time really restricts options for overnight stays. The Excel is about as good as it gets, but is hardly the stress-free start to a long journey.",4,2013/09/03
3,REDACTED,en,4548,This is at Terminal 2 but our out bound flight was an American Airlines flight (form Terminal 1 I think). We got a cab there although I know there's a shuttle bus and train to the other terminal - cab was quick and easy. The bed was INCREDIBLY hard but I find a hard mattress is good for my back so I was happy.,4,2013/08/24
3,REDACTED,en,4549,"You can't beat the convenient location of this hotel, but it's a decent hotel regardless of location.

I had to stay either near Narita or Haneda for one night while changing airports. I elected to stay at Haneda primarily because of this hotel: it's in Haneda Terminal 2, and the limousine bus to Narita stops right outside. And unlike Narita hotels, it's connected right to the terminal, so the convenience stores and amenities of the terminal are an indoor walk away. It's also a full-service hotel with a full-service restaurant. The restaurant serves from 5 AM to 1 AM: I've never seen hours that good before.

The hotel itself is a bit stark: industrial-looking corridors and smallish but clean and functional rooms. The staff is extremely attentive and friendly. Other than the room size, I'd stack this hotel up against more expensive downtown hotels like the Hilton or Sheraton any day. I paid $190 for a room with a queen size bed. It's also extremely sound-proofed and I heard no traffic or airplane noises.

The Flyer's Table restaurant was a bit of a disappointment: the food was expensive and mediocre at best.",4,2013/08/13
3,REDACTED,en,4550,"This place was a surprise, the staff very helpful and friendly even gave my kid a teddy bear welcome pack (even some of the 5 star places didn't even bother) 

Room was compact but comfortable, I like that you don't have to pay for over charged drinks in the mini bar, there's a vending machine on each level. 

They supply everything even down to a set of pajamas and air filters. 

The best bit was the room over looked the runway and parking slots, you could almost drop a coin out of the window and it will land on the plane nose, so good fun lying in bed and seeing the  totally silent coming and going of aircrafts. 

There are lots of shops and restaurants in the terminal building.

Do note that the international terminal is a 20 min bus ride away. 

Otherwise a very pleasant way to start or end a trip. ",5,2013/08/11
3,REDACTED,en,4551,"Arrived late at night for a domestic connection to Sapporo the next morning. From international terminal where we landed at 2300 hours and it was crowded, we had to hurry to ensure we are able to take the last inter-terminal free shuttle bus that ends at 2400 hours. The hotel is located at Terminal 2. Once we alighted on the arrival level, go into the terminal building and take the elevator to the departure level. The entrance to the hotel is at the end of the departure hall, on the left. As we were connecting on ANA, it was super convenient since the next day, we just walked out and the check in counters were right at its doorsteps! The hotel staff were typical of all Japanese service staff - extremely polite and helpful. Check in though late was hassle free, room was typical Japanese size, small, functional, clean but it is a transit hotel so no complaints.",5,2013/07/30
3,REDACTED,en,4552,"Flying into Tokoyo for the first time, I was told that it would be easiest to stay at the Haneda Excel overnight prior to my next day connection. I do agree that the hotel's location was very convenient, however the pricing was EXPENSIVE. For one night I paid $300+ and breakfast was extra. If you have time, I would look for other hotels in the area that are near the airport.",3,2013/07/30
3,REDACTED,en,4553,"True: the only reason to stay at the Haneda Excel Hotel Tokyu will ever be take a flight at Haneda airport. And with a location directly in the domestic terminal the place is an extremely convenient one. However, management seems to think that this is not a valid reason to make one's stay unpleasant. And they perfectly succeed in doing a - short (mine was 1 night like probably most customers') - stay a nice experience. Staff is very helpful and professional (despite a sometimes relatively poor English level especially for restaurant staff). Like very often in Japan much attention is paid to food and indeed the restaurant is very good compared to what you can expect in an airport hotel. My dinner - a fresh salad, a grilled Japanese sirloin steak and a pastry - was simple but well prepared with very fresh products. I didn't have breakfast because of an early flight. Rooms are not very spacious but clean, modern and extremely silent despite the location close to airport runways. Decoration is minimal and furniture - especially the room desk - would probably need a refresher. Tiny bathrooms but with a very good set of toiletries. Excellent free wireless connection but limited selection of international TV channels (only BBC news). Powerful air conditioning system able to rapidly cool the room down once the key has been inserted into the power control device. Haneda Excel Hotel Tokyu is an excellent airport hotel that I highly recommend to anyone having to stay overnight at Haneda airport.",4,2013/07/09
3,REDACTED,en,4554,"A great place to stay for an airport stop over. We loved Japan and hope to return and wouldn't hesitate to stay in this hotel again. The staff were professional, friendly and accommodating. The hotel is modern and spacious with a pleasing ambience. We arrived late and had room service, the meal was adequate although a little expensive. We took the shuttle to the airport the next morning and it was quick and efficient.",5,2013/07/03
3,REDACTED,en,4555,"We made our reservation on the Internet directly with the hotel and it was seamless. Arrival time from our Seattle flight was almost midnight. Some confusion in finding the hotel at a terminal different from our arrival terminal, but friendly and helpful airport security came to our rescue.

Hotel staff greeted us warmly and got us to our double room quickly. The room was spotless and very comfortable. In the morning we took the hotel breakfast, which we rarely do and were pleasantly surprised with the variety of choices. Good food and a nice airport view. We would definitely reserve again in a similar situation.",5,2013/06/20
3,REDACTED,en,4556,"This hotel was perfect for our late night arrival. Short shuttle ride from the international terminal and easy quick check in. Restaurant is open late which was great for us since after our long flight as we were ready for some real food. The meal was a lil pricey but when everything else in terminal 2 is closed and you don't vending machine food, this hit this spot. Room was very nice and a lot more spacious than most rooms we've had in Japan. The beds weren't the most comfortable thing in the world but after flying for hours, it was a welcome place to stretch out. Free working wifi is always a plus as well. With a late afternoon flight the next day, they were happy to store our luggage for us while we ventured into the city for a few hours before our next flight. You pay for the convenience but after hours of traveling, it was well worth it for us.",4,2013/06/18
3,REDACTED,en,4557,"This hotel was clean, convenient, and breakfast was excellent-all you can eat included in the price of the room. They offer western food as well as a lovely Japanese breakfast.

3,REDACTED,en,4558,"I stayed here in May 2013 following business meetings in Tokyo. I had an early morning flight, and our business partner booked this hotel for my last night in Tokyo. I am very happy that they did so. The hotel is located in Terminal 2 of the Haneda Airport. My flight departed early from the International Terminal, but the almost constant arrival and departure of the airport shuttle bus from terminal to terminal ensured that I could make my flight without rushing around in a panic. The hotel staff is professional and courteous. The rooms are small but clean. The breakfast buffet is sparse, but since it was included in my room rate, I have no complaints. One thing for which I must commend the hotel is the fact that they open the restaurant at 5:00 AM. This enabled me to grab breakfast before heading out for my flight. I was very pleased with my stay and would not hesitate to stay here again.",4,2013/05/27
3,REDACTED,en,4559,"If you arrive late to Haneda, with tired travelers, especially children or elderly, don't think any further. Book this hotel. You arrive at the international terminal, walk outside and take the easy to find bus to the domestic terminal #2. The Haneda Excel Hotel Tokyu awaits you with greatly appreciated comfort. When you awake, with a clear mind, you can be on your way to other things. In reverse, if you miss your flight, or have a grossly early departure, consider this hotel. I have not made such as good decision in a long time in my world travels.",5,2013/05/26

The rooms are comfortable and clean, and the staff members are all the super-helpful type (perhaps a bit too much?). International arrivals after 12 midnight may require a taxi to terminal 2, since the shuttle stops running at midnight. I got the last shuttle and fortunately found someone who could tell me how to get to the hotel at that late hour! I did not try their restaurant, even for breakfast; it is a bit expensive but probably okay. Noise from the airport is essentially non-existent in the rooms.
There are several less expensive hotels near the airport, so if time is not critical, you can save a bit of money by traveling another 5 minutes each way.",4,2013/04/22
3,REDACTED,en,4563,"We stayed here one night to allow for an early morning departure. The Hotel is adjacent to terminal 2, and is modern though a little spartan. The room seemed small but my wife, who is experienced with Tokyo, said it is large by local standards. We had a three bed room, quite tight but the beds were comfortable, the bathroom spacious and well equipped. Everything we needed and quick service at the front desk. The shuttle to other terminals is located one level below the hotel, and provides easy free service starting at 5am. Service is at 20 minute intervals during such early hours but is more frequent later. Both terminal 2 and the international terminal have many choices for dining and shopping, it is a very nice airport to use, and having the hotel on property was just what we needed. Pricey at $325, but it is Tokyo...",4,2013/04/21
3,REDACTED,en,4564,"Stayed at this hotel for one night when flying out from the International Terminal early the next morning, thinking it would be convenient. Next time we’ll stay in a city hotel and take a cab in the morning directly to the terminal. The hotel room was utilitarian and expensive. If you need to print your boarding pass there are computers in the lobby, but you will be charged to use them. The complimentary early shuttle to the International Terminal was over crowded and there was no assistance with bags. This hotel may be more convenient for domestic travel since it is directly connected to that terminal where there are also plenty of restaurants and shops. The staff were very polite.",3,2013/04/21
3,REDACTED,en,4565,"Stayed here because had an early flight and the hotel Is attached to a domestic terminal and there is a shuttle bus to the other terminals.

For an airport hotel is nice. room was well appointed and staff helpful. When learning we would miss breakfast, without asking indicated would provide sandwiches to take with.

The restuarant in the hotel did not look special but in the terminal itself there is a huge choice and had a nice dinner there.

Would stay here again if circumstances were similar.",4,2013/03/16
3,REDACTED,en,4566,"Stayed in this hotel 2 nights for business. The hotel was clean, friendly staff and offers free wi-fi. I was disappointed to find that there was no gym facilities. Breakfast was extra cost and had a standard selection of western/eastern foods, nothing too fancy. Food in the restaurant was of good quality, but one can easily find cheaper in the adjoining terminal. Access to the rest of Tokyo can be by bus or if one is prepared to navigate the maze of subway tracks and stations, this is the alternative. The rooms are small in size, but that's what you get in Japan. The beds are very hard compared to what I'm used to. Didn't really notice any noise from the airport or adjoining rooms. Oh yes and the hotel has no problem with earthquakes as I slept through a 6.4 magnitude quake on the first night! I can only recommend this if you are transiting through Haneda airport and need some overnight rest.",3,2013/03/09

It took less than forty minutes from the time I landed at the international terminal, traveled to terminal two, to fully check in and relax in my hotel room. This was something I was grateful for after a very long day of flying. It was very easy to locate the hotel and I was immediately greeted by the staff upon entering the front doors. The staff was very attentive in assisting with luggage and processing my registration quickly and professionally. I found the property to be streamlined with a modern flare but still captured a warm and inviting feeling. My room was very detailed and clean. I appreciated the small details of their green program, to their linen spray, to their room key controlled lights and so forth. I also truly appreciated the noise resistant windows etc. I found my room to be very quite from any outside noise. The price was really reasonable than what I would have anticipated. I found the best deal on room rates through their corporate hotel site versus any other. I will definately stay at Haneda Excel on my future stop overs to Okinawa Japan!",5,2013/03/06
3,REDACTED,en,4568,"Location
Right inside Terminal 2 at the beginning (from when cars arrive). Good location, one can walk right into the terminal where there are lots of shops, restaurants and cafes. Perfect for flights. 
Room
Room was adequate size, shaped as rectangular with a small thinnish desk a large TV on it (but poor quality of picture for BBC) a simple chair and foot rest. Bed however was large double quite wide and was very comfortable with feather and tempur pedic pillows. A seperate small alclove room for the closet, mini bar and trouser press with a good amount of room. Lighting was good with 3 lamps all with dimmer functions. Decor was ok but fairly plain and Japanese with no pictures in the room and grey walls with white blinds. Cabinets are all beige. It has modern Japanese feel about it not innovative and some what dull. The bathroom however is quite big and a normal room as opposed to a raised compartment as seen on other Japanese hotels. It had the standard electronic toilet with a bath/shower combination but strong shower function with modern control functions. Amenities are plain and include Shower gel, Conditioner and Shampoo. One must bring there own body lotion as this is not provided, also unusually bottled water is not provided for free (which is standard in majority of Asian hotels).
Staff
Staff are somewhat below standard for Japanese culture. They do not seem to offer a warm service although it is efficient. One cannot for instance sit in the bar area unless you buy a drink even if you are paying the high room price and staff will tell you to leave. 
Facilities
Very limited facilities, WIFI is free and works well and fairly fast. There is a restaurant downstairs in which had breakfast. Food is quite limited for instance no uncut fruit and standard is poor for western with greasy bacon, under done omelet and only white bread on offer. There is a salad bar but only tinned fruit. Staff just tell you to sit wherever and feels very much like a school canteen. 
Overall the hotel is very clean, room and bathroom is good size but is slightly overpriced possibly because it is on the airport, staff and breakfast was disappointing and do not tend to offer the service expected from the Japanese.",3,2013/02/26
3,REDACTED,en,4569,"Its at terminal two, so you can catch the free shuttle to the other two terminals. First free shuttle bus & monorail is 5am, the hotel do two free runs of there own at 4am ish and 4:20am Clean, tidy, modern hotel Free wifi",4,2013/02/23
3,REDACTED,en,4570,"Booked this hotel purely because we had an early BA flight at 06:25am and a few extra mins of shut eye before 12 hour flight is always welcomed! 

We paid Y21,800 for a twin room, expensive because we booked at last minute, room on 7th floor, though it faced part of the runway, you really couldn't hear much and most of the flights from Terminal 2 (where the hotel is located) are departed by 9pm. As mentioned earlier, the rooms are clean, compact and perfectly adequate for a layover. The hotel does provide a free shuttle bus and it leaves the hotel at 03:50am and 04:20am, takes 10mins to get to the International Terminal, with stop at Terminal 1 in between. After these times, the only other options are after 05:00am with another shuttle bus (not hotel's) or the monorail (which is speedy and you can use your JR RailPass on). 

We didn't eat in the hotel as there were plenty of dining options in the other terminals, which we hopped between because of our JR Pass, though please note some of the restaurants in T2 did close early at 8:30pm because most of the flights are departed by 9.

Happy to stay here again, convenient and staff are courteous and helpful.",4,2013/02/16

Location: At the Haneda airport overlooking the taxiways and runways.
Rooms: extremely small, but well laid out. Beds could be a bit better. Appliances- excellent.
Minibar- only drinks- so kept me from having that unnecessary midnight snack!
Gym- none - this is the biggest drawback IMHO for any hotel.
Pool- non-existent.
Wifi- excellent.
Hotel Restaurant: extremely expensive, small portions and very poor selection.
Hospitality - very good as you'd expect in Japan.

3,REDACTED,en,4572,"This is one of my regular places to stay for a few days in Tokyo, even though it's somewhat away from the center of town. I find it convenient because of the direct limousine bus service to and from Narita airport, as well as having the Tokyo monorail and Keikyu railway stations just downstairs. As has been my previous experience, the rooms continue to be up to the same standards as in previous years, as is the service from everyone from housekeeping, to front desk, to bell staff. You are treated like a guest here, and even though I can speak enough Japanese to get by, everyone here appears to speak at least some english. Some minor changes from my previous stays concern the bathroom amenities. The traditional bath towel (long washcloth) is now being provided, and the disposable ones are no longer part of the amenity kit. I view this as a positive change. Don't forget to use the ""Green"" door hanger if you don't need your sheets, pillowcases, duvet, or pajamas changed, as this hotel actually has a working program as opposed to others that just advertise it, and ignore your wishes. There is no option with respect to replacement of towels yet, they will be changed daily no matter what you do or say. Don't forget to sign up as a a ""Comfort Member"" for 500 yen, as you can book a room at the ""Comfort Members Rate"" which will save you quite a bit, and earn you points you can trade for various things, including gift certificates. In essence, besides getting a discount on the room rate, you are getting an addiitonal 5% discount if you manage your points properly. There is a restaurant located in the lobby (""Flyer's Table"") which has good food at a decent price, and terrific service. There are also many restaurants in Haneda terminal 2 (where the hotel is located), Terminal 1 and the new International terminal. Katsugen on the fourth floor of Terminal 2 is one of my favorites for pork cutlets, and tempura. This stay I paid (Yen)14,600 per day for the room, no meals. The rate can vary widely depending on when you book, but if the rates change and get lower, you can always modify your reservation online and get the lower rate without any problem. Good value for business travel, but I wouldn't recommend a long term stay here for families. Obviously, this hotel can't be beat for an overnite stay while connecting from or to an international flight.",4,2013/02/01

3,REDACTED,en,4574,"We stayed one night due to an early morning international flight. The hotel was very convenient-being located in terminal 2. top hotel, good service and quiet considering its location!
However please be warned if taking an early morning flight, that the advertised free shuttle bus to the only terminal that is open for early flights does not start until 5am so your only option is to take a pretty pricey taxi (3000 yen for a 3 minute journey). 
The hotel mentions none of this when you book your early morning wake up call but can get a taxi pretty quickly. 
Not entirely their fault but there was another foreign hotel guest having a meltdown over this issue as she was about to miss her flight due to the shuttle bus times not being mentioned anywhere-so be warned!!",4,2013/01/19
3,REDACTED,en,4575,"Chose this hotel on our inbound leg from the US because we arrived at 10 pm on a 9 hour layover and the hotel's restaurant is still serving (until 1 am). I did not know whether we would be hungry and need to eat then.

Getting to the hotel late night after a long flight is not straight forward. After winding your way out of the international terminal and taking the airport shuttle, you walk a couple hundred meters past the part of domestic terminal 2 that is closed at night before entering the hotel. I did not spot the 24 hour convenience store supposedly near the hotel entrance.

We were waited on immediately at check-in. A nice young woman escorted us and our bags up to our room, then gave us the Wi-Fi code. Note that the elevator is on one end of the hotel and most rooms are a long walk. The room is OK with BBC and CCTV international news. The beds are firm and we mostly slept well. The shower/tub is long but shallow, and there are plenty of high quality toiletries. 

The bar at the restaurant is not a traditional one, just a long, low table, and no one was using it the night we stayed there. Just as well. The hotel was pushing special holiday menus of up to 12,500 yen per person. The vending machines provide beer, wine, water and soft drinks.

If you are making a short connection to an international flight, there are cheaper, more convenient options. But if you are connecting to a domestic flight or have a longer layover (mid afternoon arrival), Excel will work for you better. The Tokyo monorail is close by and is very quick to downtown. The KK train goes directly to Tokyo Station and is cheaper.",4,2013/01/07
3,REDACTED,en,4576,"This is a top hotel. Great service, and you would expect this as you pay over $300 a night for this hotel. I have a family of 6, so we had to book two ajoining rooms (ouch!). This worked out just perfect. The staff were ready for us even after close to midnight, and the kids got a bag of special treats on arrival (typically Japanese service).
But it's all worth this stay because it is quiet and it is built into the Domestic 2 terminal. Gates are literally outside the hotel room and also the busses are just a floor down from the main departure level.
The only bad thing was the English instructions to get to the hotel from the international terminal. If you arrive at the international ternimal you just have to catch the free shuttle bus to Terminal 2 from Bus stand 0.
The breakfast was varied and great. Both western and Japanese styles available, but you pay for this separately, of course. Great study desk in room and free Wifi.

I had to take a taxi as the hotel free shuttle bus was also closed. It was about 1000yen plus as the starting price was 700yen. THe hotel is located in terminal 2.

The hotel is located in terminal 2 and for an airport hotel it’s very nice. The reception is smart and spacious. The rooms are a reasonable size, although fairly functional and without any frills. The bed was very comfortable and we had a very good nights sleep. For those people needing transfers to other terminals there is an hotel bus before 5am.

This train also stops at the International terminal. I really like this hotel. The location is great. Really convenient to catch a morning flight. Make sure you check with the front desk what time the bus departs for the International terminal in the morning. It is scheduled and it is free.

There is a convenience store open 24 hours in the International Terminal just by where the shuttle leave you off, so no worries for coffee and light snacks if you are hungry at 4 am. 

Additional benefit is all the shops and restaurants located in the Terminal 2, where we did souvenir shopping spending the last few hours and yen of our stay. Our room also directly faced the airport gates and runways, and was the best seat to watch planes that come and go. Overall, we wanted to stay longer if we had more time than just passing through. Maybe next time we will plan that way!",5,2012/09/09
3,REDACTED,en,4584,"We wanted to be at Haneda International Terminal around 5am to catch our very early flight back. After a research, I have concluded that it is not possible to achieve this by Public transport (Terminal Shuttle Bus service does not start until 5am).
This hotel is located within Domestic Terminal 2, so its access to/from other terminals and town via train/monorail/bus is really good except between midnight - 5am.
On our arrival at the hotel, we were made aware that the hotel operated free shuttle bus to International Terminal (takes 10mins), only outside of airport shuttle bus service hours.
We arrived at Haneda T2 via domestic flight early afternoon, then after dumping our heavy bags we spent afternoon/evening in Roppongi/Shibuya before reaching our bed.
Hotel provided free Wifi as well.
Next morning we caught a free hotel shuttle to International Terminal. The price we booked did not include breakfast that we could not have - so nothing is missed.
The room was clean and well designed for our use - especially a large storage area for many big bags of family of 4.

So, this is ideal for those who arrives late, leaves early or one night stopover.",5,2012/08/30
3,REDACTED,en,4585,"My flight came into Haneda at midnight so I stayed at this hotel for one night. Excellent location right at the terminal. Room was small, but then I was only there for sleep. Excellent ammenities and extremely clean, as is the Japanese style. Very modern. Excellent internet connection. Reasonabily priced. Easy connection to the Tokyo subway via the monorail and the JR line. Would absolutely stay again.",4,2012/08/15
3,REDACTED,en,4586,"We spent our last night in Japan at this hotel and selected it becaus we had a 6:50am flight the next morning from the International Terminal back to the states. I could not be more pleased. The staff were very friendly, our room was HUGE, the bathroom was lovely and it was very convenient to everything. We had a great view of the planes landing and taking off and a great sunset. We wondered why we bothered to stay in the heart of Tokyo in our other hotel seeing as you can get just about everywhere in Tokyo via subway and all you have to do is take the monorail from the airport to the subway station. The monorail and subways were very crowded but very inexpensive compared to the taxi we had to take to our Tokyo hotel from Haneda airport when we first arrived in Japan. Our room was not ready when we arrived so they had to hold our luggage for us while we went out and about. When it was ready upon our return they brought all of our bags up to our room for us. The bathroom had a wonderful deep tub to take a bath, a separate toilet area with a door and a great stand up shower, plus it had really nice bathroom amenities. The tv did get a few English speaking channels as well. We ate at the hotel's restaurant for dinner and it was to die for, the best meal we had in Japan! The service was impeccable and the quality of the food was great.",5,2012/08/10
3,REDACTED,en,4587,"We were on our way back from Asia to the US and had to spend a night in Tokyo, our flight departed the next morning from Haneda Airport and staying here was the best decision. It is a bit far from the city, but was much easier to take the long ride after dinner, and wake up in the morning literally at the airport. Clean, good size rooms for Tokyo standards and great friendly service. Significantly better than other airport hotels I've stayed at. Can take the baggage cart all the way to the lobby!",4,2012/08/09
3,REDACTED,en,4588,"Modern hotel with good sized rooms for Japan. The check in/out was friendly on my stay. The price was higher than other areas, but this is most likely because the hotel is on site at airport. The food in the restaurant was adequate and fairly priced.",3,2012/07/12
3,REDACTED,en,4589,"We stayed here on our last night in Tokyo on our way back to Singapore then Australia.
This hotel was ideal as our flight left at 6:40am. The hotel is modern, clean and comfortable.
The staff here were wonderful! Nothing was a problem for them.
I would stay here again. If i was to find something negative it would be that the beds are very hard, but i still slept well.",4,2012/07/07
3,REDACTED,en,4590,Check in/out service not very friendly. Room was expensive (did not include breakfast) but clean and comfortable. Handy for an early flight and if you do not want the hassle of transfer buses/trains.,3,2012/07/03
3,REDACTED,en,4591,"My room at this hotel was a lot larger than I had expected. There were notices of works happening at the hotel, so I wonder if I got an upgrade as a result. I had a restful nights sleep before a 4am flight. The complimentary shuttle was great and ran on time. Would stay again if I had a late night arrival or early departure. Otherwise, it is too far out of Tokyo to be useful for a traveler.",4,2012/06/19
3,REDACTED,en,4592,"I arrived at Haneda from the U.S. late in the evening, with two small children in tow. Nothing was better than the easy shuttle to Domestic Terminal 2, then the short walk inside the terminal to the hotel entrance. Staff amused my kids while I checked in, the room was impeccable. There was no need to have breakfast at the hotel, as the terminal is full of restaurants to choose from. A great way to start the trip.",5,2012/06/12
3,REDACTED,en,4593,"Great place to stay to catch an early flight! The hotel has great food too! And the hotel do provide early bus to bring you to the other terminals, but don't missed the bus as that's the only bus in the ealy morning. The hotel staff was kind enough to let us know when we check in and offer to give us an early wake up call! Great service!
Hotel room is very small but very clean. We did enjoy our stay.",4,2012/05/22
3,REDACTED,en,4594,"I stayed at the Tokyu which is attached to the Haneda Airport for 3 or 4 days last year in June. Japan Travel Bureau was offering a special. Airfare and Hotel for 4 nights was around $780.00 total. Unfortunately, or fortunately, I arrived in Narita and took the bus to Haneda. It was direct and was very easy to find. Lots of helpful people in the airport.

While I did not relish staying next to Haneda, it was very easy getting into the City to do my sightseeing and there are lots of restaurants that were open early and late to allow me to get food, including a convenience store.

No complaints with the hotel at all. I only experienced one little earthquake while there. Fantastic people at the hotel desk. Highly recommend. They have a really nice hot water heater so you can make coffee, tea or instant ramen if desired!",4,2012/05/21
3,REDACTED,en,4595,"Arrived at Narita and took a Limo Bus to Haneda Terminal 2 where this hotel is connected at one side. You can literally wake up, change, check out, and grab your spinner and run to the security gate for your flight within minutes. There are various restaurants, stores, and souvenir shops in the airport concourse but not much is open past 8pm so if you arrive late you need to find a cup noodle vending machine (the hotel restaurant is open until later however.) The morning breakfast buffet was impressive spanning across several counters with an assortment of western, Japanese, and other food. Don't expect a great view or any surrounding area points of interest - this is just a good enroute stop over owing to the direct connection of the hotel lobby to the airport concourse. Now if only you could check in, check baggage, and get your boarding ticket from the comfort of your room before waking up....",4,2012/05/16
3,REDACTED,en,4596,"My daughter and I were taking a trip to Singapore from Dallas and our ""midpoint"" was Tokyo. As if flying for more than half a day wasn't enough on top of a 12 hour layover, we had an airport change as well. 

Haneda was 80 mins away from Narita via airport limousine bus. Our 4 heavy pieces of luggage meant the train was out. A ""cheapest"" chauffeured limousine was USD 250! Ha! When we arrived at the next airport, we were near comatose! Thank goodness I made a booking at the Haneda Excel Hotel Tokyu. ( Booking.com was the only service we found that would have let us cancel at 6pm the day of arrival. We were hoping to get a second wind and head to The Ginza. Another ha!)

We calculated that we were only going to be at this hotel for a max of 4-5 hours. We wanted to check in and check out the myriad of shops and restaurants at Haneda. ( I have to say they were FAR better than the ones at Narita.)

A side note about the limousine bus and check in. Before leaving the US, JAL said we could only check in 3 hours prior to the flight. But upon check-in at the JAL airport counter they said we could check in anytime after 6am the day of departure. We should've have gone to the counter first. It was at a different terminal form the hotel terminal (2). The airport limousine bus we took to Haneda loaded all our suitcases on carts and sent us on our way. We didn't have to lift a thing. But when we took the internal ( free) shuttle service to our (international) departure terminal later, there was noone to help with our 4 bags. The bus driver and everyone on the bus watched me struggle up and down with the bags. Horrid esp in the rain!

Anyway, we found the hotel with ease. We told the limousine bus operators where we wanted to go and they told us which terminal to get off at. You alight at one end then have to walk back to the other end of the terminal. We were so tired we didn't think we were ever going to make it!!

When I made the hotel booking we asked for a day rate. We were told they didn't have such a thing. Maybe the front desk didn't understand the booking.com rep when she called on my behalf. Noone at that front desk speaks English. The manager spoke a smattering but it was still difficult communicating. When we got in, I tried asking the manager promising him that they'd have the room back in 4 hours. He said that they had just sold out on that day rate! So, this hotel will go down as one of the most expensive hotels we've stayed at! Four hours for USD242. But as my daughter said, it was one of the best calls I've ever made!

The room: was a decent size with a long desk. We could have brought all our suitcases up and still had tons of room to move around. The double or quadruple glazed windows ensured that NO sound penetrated. Amazing, since the planes on the runway outside our window were within spitting distance. Someone mentioned that the rooms were dated or tired. I didn't find that to be so. Our room was newish looking, modern though I'm not talking W Hotel standards. But it's got that traditional Japanese feel. 

The bathroom: was smallish but sufficient. The particle board door kept out sounds and odors! The bathroom was spotlessly clean. It also had one of those interesting toilets that performed a whole lot of extraneous functions!

Closet: space was plentiful. Lots of hangers plus an iron and ironing board. There was also a handy organic spray made of green tea to remove odors and freshen our clothes. If I could've carried one more thing in my bag, I would have bought one of those sprays. Our jkts and clothes smelled clean and fresh after 4 hours!

Amenities: On our beds, they laid out two thin cotton, Japanese robes. They were most comfortable. It wsa nice to get out of our clothes and nap in something light. The bathroom toiletries provided were: razor, shaving gel, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, tooth brushes and tooth paste, loofah scrub clothes. More than enough though I would have loved some body lotion.

Beds: were extremely comfortable with lovely pressed cotton sheets. Heaven! For the first time since I began requesting firm pillows (100 yaers ago!), this is the ONLY hotel in the world that has gotten it right. They provided two different firm pillows. One was like a Tempurepedic. Another was almost like a down-filled pillow that was packed and very firm. I loved both of them. 

Before our nap I called down to the front desk to ask a question. No concierge. Noone spoke much English. So if you had any queries, you'd best head out to the airport information desk and try your luck there.

I took off one dot for the ""lost in translation"" problem, ""non-existent"" day rate and it being very expensive. Other than that, I have no complaints about this hotel. The staff were very polite and helpful. For what it is, the hotel is expensive but they know they have a captive audience. We were so tired and jet lagged. There was no way we would have been able to take another cab to another less expensive hotel nearby. The airport hotel was there at the right place at the right time for us.",4,2012/05/05
3,REDACTED,en,4597,"Stayed for one night as I had a 5am international flight. Service was excellent and they even made me a bento box for breakfast when I check out the next morning at 4am. There is also a great shuttle to the international terminal which leaves at regular times.

I ordered room service and had a lovely meal (spaghetti bolognese) which was great change after all the Japanese food. The room was clean, you could hear any flights taking off and the bed was comfy. 

Would stay again if taking an early flight!",5,2012/04/23
3,REDACTED,en,4598,"Our flight was due to leave Haneda at 06 25 meaning an 04 30 check-in. At this time the trains are not running and so we would have had to take (an expensive) taxi ride from Tokyo out to the airport.

This modern hotel is right in the domestic terminal building. The room was perfectly adequate and there is restaurant and bar if you need it. There is a free shuttle bus at 04 20 which takes you to the international terminal to check-in.

Obviously not the hotel to choose for a lengthy stay in Tokyo, but ideal for what we wanted.",4,2012/04/18
3,REDACTED,en,4599,"The hotel is connected to terminal 2. You actually walk past all the check in desks before walking through into the hotel lobby. For location it is hard to be beat, especially if you have an early flight or a late landing. There are buses to terminal 1, but its as easy to walk through the connecting passageway. We flew from the International terminal. You can get a shuttle bus from T2 to the international terminal. The buses don't begin until after 5am. However, the hotel has recently put on a bus at 3.50am and 4.20am respectively. They are just for the international terminal and it takes 10 minutes. This was especially good for us as our flight was at 6.20am. This is a nice bonus as there were quite a few wanting such an early arrival at the terminal. This bus is on a first come first served basis, however the bus used was big, so I wouldnt think it would ever get full.

The room i had was a small double, which was adequate for my wife and I as we were only there for a few hours. I wouldn't want that room if I was there for much longer. The bed was pushed against the wall. There was room however to move the bed so both of us could walk down either side of it. I am not sure why the hotel do not change this themselves, it would make the room work better. 

Rooms as ever were up to Japan standards, clean and with good bathroom amenities. Would stay here again, but if I was staying longer than I did I would opt for a bigger room. It was also quite expensive room charge for such a small room. You pay extra for the convenience of staying 'on' airport.

Monorail into Tokyo is a short walk from the hotel. The hotel has a restaurant, but there are plenty of other eating options within the terminal.",4,2012/03/30
3,REDACTED,en,4600,"I stayed in a spacious King bed room for 2 nights on a recent business trip. Similar to reviewer ""mochabert"", it was a nicely laid out room with a large dressing area (with a large closet and luggage bench) across from a spacious bathroom with a long vanity counter covered with amenities, a large tub/shower, and a toilet at the very end of the long bathroom. This layout does not seem to be shown in any of the photos, but it was much larger than any shown. The room had multiple windows overlooking the terminal building, a long desk extending the length of one wall (with the TV on it at one end), the comfortable king bed, and a chair/ottoman. Everything was very nice about the room, except the sink/vanity was very low to the ground (Japanese style), which required some adjustment if you are tall. The hotel being adjacent to the airport was a plus - Haneda's airports are set up like shopping malls and have plenty of restaurants too. All of the trains into Tokyo run in/out of the airport, so in addition to busses/taxis, the train was just a short walk into the terminal. The rooms must have extra noise insulation, as I did not hear the noise of the aircraft or any noise from adjacent rooms.",4,2012/03/29
3,REDACTED,en,4601,"We chose to stay here instead of in Tokyo city this time and although it was more expensive we were pleasantly surprised at the size of the room. We decided on a twin room and it had ample space compared to some in Japan. The room was clean and nicely furnished.
Hotel service was great and would stay here again.",4,2012/03/22
3,REDACTED,en,4602,"I stayed at one of their King-size bed rooms for 2 nights. The layout is quite well thought out and I found the guest room very useable - On your entry, one side is a roomy closet and baggage area, and the other is a bath and toilet (which can be separated by a sliding door). Room is spacious, clean and simply done. I'm often annoyed by the lack of decent working desk space in many Japanese hotels but this one was quite good albeit small. Staff was all friendly, helpful, and had answers to most of my queries. Haneda is also well connected to places such as Yokohama by bus routes, so this could be a good base in Tokyo - obviously very advantageous if you are traveling through Haneda.",4,2012/01/31
3,REDACTED,en,4603,"If you are in transit through Haneda, then this hotel is perfectly located! Even if you fly into the new international terminal, you can just jump on the free bus which goes between the terminals and takes 5 minutes. The Haneda Excel is at the far left of the terminal as you go in.

Yes, the rooms are small but this is an airport hotel and you are not going to live here for any length of time, are you? It is very convenient for the restaurants and shops in the terminal if you don't like the look of the cafe in the hotel (which is open from 0500 to 0030).",4,2012/01/21
3,REDACTED,en,4604,"Stayed overnight for an early flight to Okinawa. Hotel is attached to Terminal 2 and you can literally walk into the lobby of the hotel from the western wing of the departure hall. Super convenient!!! The added plus is that there are plenty of restaurants situated in Terminal 2 as well. Hotel is clean and efficient and perfect for an overnight stay.

Will definitely stay again.",4,2012/01/03
3,REDACTED,en,4605,"Unlike heb999 below, I had an excellent experience catching an early flight at Haneda. The concierge has clear printed instructions in English with a map that indicates how to get to Bus Stop No. 9 at the arrivals level, which is one level below the hotel. There is a 24 hour hotel entrance that is clearly marked, which leads to the outside and a short distance from a 24 hr entrance to Terminal 2 where an elevator takes you down to arrivals and you walk a short distance to bus stop no. 9 where the green bus takes you to the International Terminal. Also contrary to heb999, the bus starts at 5:02am and runs every 6 minutes after that. Not 7am!!! For our 6:25 flight, we caught the 5:02 and were at the International Terminal in 10 minutes. Couldn't be more convenient. For travellers catching earlier flights, the hotel has arranged two special buses which leave at 4am and 430am should you need to get to the International Terminal even earlier.

Otherwise the hotel was simple and clean, but a bit overpriced for the standards. However, this isn't surprising for the convenience. Terminal 2 has an abundance of sweets and snack shops as well as a variety of restaurants and some shopping. It is actually a very convenient place to buy gifts and snacks before leaving Japan and would actually suggest that travellers staying at the Haneda Excel wanting to shop and buy gifts and arrive early, check-in and do last minute shopping. Overall, it was a good experience at Haneda Excel.",5,2011/12/01
3,REDACTED,en,4606,"Stayed there in other to catch an early flight to Toyama. It is the main reason I chose the hotel. But contrary to other reviews, it is nothing to brag about! Room is small, very basic, and the breakfast offered for 1900 JPY didn't have that much selection. I have stayed at much plusher hotels in Tokyo, Nagoya, and Toyama for the same room rate and much nicer rooms and hotels.",3,2011/11/13
3,REDACTED,en,4607,"This is a great hotel for those, like us, who are overnighting in Tokyo. We arrived in the early afternoon, checked in and caught the monorail and train to Shinjuku for an afternoon and evening of shopping and eating. 

The beds were comfy, service was excellent and it was so convenient to catch the interterminal bus (free) to the international terminal early the next morning.",4,2011/09/24
3,REDACTED,en,4608,"Enjoyed a one night stop here. No complaints about the hotel which has great rooms and good staff. Arrived late and left early so cannot comment on the restaurants or other facilities. Can say that the bed was very comfortable, the room and bathroom large, clean and very well appointed.
Our only problem was that we had a very early flight (7.00 am) from the Haneda International terminal. The staff at the hotel reception advised us where we could catch the shuttle bus. The hotel is situated right inside the terminal and so getting out onto the street requires walking through the terminal. This involved quite a circuitous route through the domestic terminal as it was not open at 5.00 am and many doors were still locked. When we eventually found the bus stop we discovered that the bus did not start running until 7.00 am. In our panic we tried to find a taxi but they were almost non-existent and the odd one that was running would not stop. Eventually, I almost had to stand in the middle of the road and force a taxi to take us. The driver was very unhappy but we were desperate. The trip between the terminals cost about US$30.
So, if you have a very early check-in at the international terminal arrange a taxi the night before - it is far too far to walk.",5,2011/09/17
3,REDACTED,en,4609,"We had to catch 6.25 flight out of Haneda International. Better than worry about getting to airport in time for flight we stayed at Haneda Excel, which is part of Terminal 2. There is a free airport shuttle bus to International Terminal that only takes a few minutes. Would always use the Excel hotel in future. It is easy to get to from the centre of Tokyo by monorail or Keikyu airport line, and takes only a short time if you want to get back into Tokyo in the evening. 
Hotel room provides all the facilities you need and the bathroom has hairbrushes, facial soap, body soap, shampoo, conditioner, toothbrushes and toothpaste. We had a room facing the airfield, and their was no noise from the aeroplanes.
We did not try the hotel's restaurant but there are lots of restaurants in all the terminal buildings.",4,2011/06/20
3,REDACTED,en,4610,"This is a good hotel. Great location at Terminal 2 (ANA, Air Do), within seconds you'll get to the ANA/AIR DO counter. Friendly staff. Good breakfast buffet. Clean, Modern, and large rooms. Quiet rooms but still you can see the airplanes taking off on the runway (ideal for airplane geeks). Slightly overpriced if you think you'll stay just one night for an early plane (you can get a good room around Kamata for half the price). When you're tired at Haneda and want a good treat for yourself, or when you're first time in Tokyo for a very short stay and plan to use this airport for domestic and international flights, then this hotel is a great option.",4,2011/04/07
3,REDACTED,en,4611,"Very convenient. Staff helped with travel plans, getting taxi that took cards, computer help, and printing, all at midnight. Really good breakfast too. Bed a little hard, but no worse than standard in Asia.",4,2011/02/25
3,REDACTED,en,4612,"Hotel fine - single rooms are small, and relatively expensive but for convenience you can beat it. The hotel is located inside terminal 2 - with the domestic terminal 1 (JAL) only a 5 minute bus ride away. A bus to Narita Intertnational airport from here takes about 1.5 hours traffic permitting. The hotel worked perfectly for me as I was arriving late from Hong Kong, and flying on the first JAL flight (7am) to Sapporo (Hokkaido) the following day",4,2011/01/22
3,REDACTED,en,4613,"Check in only took a few minutes, and the front desk staff was incredibly polite. Went right up to my room to shower and sleep (after a 14hr flight, wouldn’t you?). Shower had refillable dispensers of soap, shampoo and conditioner. There was plenty of hot water available. Bathroom was small, but the toilet was very futuristic, and the mirror had a steam proof section. The TV was a flat screen, and there was a mini bar. They participate in a green program where if you don’t use certain products they leave in the bathroom they will donate a dollar to a green charity. The room was the cleanest I’ve ever stayed in. Expensive, but worth the money and the great location.",5,2010/12/20
3,REDACTED,en,4614,"The room was confortable and clean. They provided free Internet connection via LAN cable (the cable itself was provided as well). The hotel has no bar, but it has a restaurant. We did not try it however, as there are lots of restaurants in the airport building itself. 
Overall, an elegant hotel with perfect location if you have an early flight from Haneda.",4,2010/12/10
3,REDACTED,en,4615,"We chose this hotel because it was right at Haneda Airport for our connecting flight to Hokkaido on the next day.

We paid about USD 250 a night for a room of 3 persons WITHOUT breakfast. As usual in Japan, for a so called triple room it is in fact a twin room with an extra bed.

The room we got had nothing special. The extra bed caused the room having less space to move around.

Maybe the hotel is good for business traveller. For leisure travel, I do not recommend unless you don't want to rush to airport very early in the morning.",3,2010/09/14
3,REDACTED,en,4616,"I stayed here because of the location. I did not want to wake up early to catch my flight the next morning after a short visit to Tokyo on my way to Beijing. In other words I did not want to risk missing my 930 flight by taking a taxi from inside the city. At least an hour drive in traffic. On top of that I arrived the previous day at night and finding a hotel late night is no fun. The ""limo bus"" took us directly to Haneda Airport and the hotel is right inside the lobby. It was a good feeling to know your room was available at 10pm. (Many shops close by 10pm). Although its higher priced for a budget trip, it was worth the safety/convience and peace of mind to know you had a place to stay for this first visit to Japan.",5,2010/06/10
3,REDACTED,en,4617,This hotel is in a great location for a stop over. The breakfast was nice. The room was clean and a good size. The kids loved watching the planes from the window. The customer service was outstanding. Very helpful and extremely friendly. Would recommend.,5,2010/02/26
3,REDACTED,en,4618,"The hotel is lovely and easily accessible. The airport limousine biases, taxis, or the train are all simple ways to get to and from the airport. The hotel itself is very clean an well maintained. The staff are very patient and helpful. They kindly upgraded my room for no reason. Their English is perfect. While it is in the busiest airport in the country it is remarkably quiet and you can get a sound sleep here. I found the price a bit high for an \""airport hotel\"" but it is one of the only realistic choices around.",4,2010/01/19

3,REDACTED,en,4621,"My stay at the Tokyu Hotel was unintended. My flight out of Beijing was delayed so I missed my connection to Honolulu. ANA was kind enough to put me up for the night at the transit hotel. I wasn't expecting all that much so I was pleasantly surprised.

The quality of the hotel was much higher than I anticipated. The room was very small but very nicely set out, using all available space. The climate control worked well and the queen size bed was very comfortable. The room was spotlessly clean and well maintained. The TV was disappointing, with the only English language programming being CNN - which was locked up during most of my stay. The bathroom was small but functional, with a good, hot shower. The room was very quiet and I was not disturbed at all during the night.

Check-in and check-out went very smoothly with all the staff being very courteous and friendly. There was a restaurant there that looked very nice but I did not get a chance to eat there. 

I thought the room was greatly overpriced, at least according to the rack rates, but you tend to get that at airport hotels due to the lack of competition. The location is great if you are just making a transit in Tokyo, but if you are planning on staying in Tokyo for any length of time and doing some sightseeing, then you would be much better off in the city. Recommended for airport transit stops, but otherwise give it a miss.",3,2009/11/10
3,REDACTED,en,4622,Very convenient as it is located inside Terminal 2 (ANA). I was actually flying with JAL which fly from Terminal 1 but there are free shuttle buses which run very regularly between the two terminals so that was not an issue. The room was well appointed and a pretty good size for a Japanese hotel. Restaurant was nice and not too expensive. Highly recommended if you want to be near the airport for an early flight.,5,2009/10/12
3,REDACTED,en,4623,"This is a great hotel if you need to stay at Haneda airport. It is located at the end of Terminal 2, so you can access the shops and restaurants. There is also a free shuttle bus to Terminal 1. There is a restaurant and cafe/bar in the hotel too. I found it to be quite modern, clean, and upmarket. However, it is a little pricey because there isn't a lot of competition in the area for other accommodation or hotels. It's perfect for a stay over, especially if you have an early morning flight as I did.",4,2008/08/07
3,REDACTED,en,4624,"I started with a different assumption from the previous reviewer. I had an early-morning flight and I was dreading staying at the airport hotel. I was delightfully surprised at how nice it was. My room was small but very stylish (in that European everything-in-its-place kind of way). The restaurant was much better than expected and not too expensive. As the previous reviewer mentions, this hotel is not close or convenient to town. I wouldn't recommend it as a tourist hotel for visiting Tokyo. Althoug if you do want to go into town, take the monorail instead of the train. The price is about the same and the views are great!

3,REDACTED,en,4625,"Was put up at the Haneda Excel Tokyu Hotel on a business trip due to budget constraints. The hotel in general is fine, perfect with bathtubs, hotpots, ironing boards etc. My ony grouse really is its location.

Forget about this hotel if you're planning to stay for more than 2 days. The fact that it is located at Haneda airport makes travelling a chore. In case you havn't realise yet, transportation (even public) is expensive! To get from the hotel to the nearest decent town (Hamamatsucho) by monorail would set you back by JPY470 per way - not to mention the transfers needed if you were to get somewhere else like Shibuya, Shinjuku or Ueno.

Being situated at Haneda has its plus and minuses - if you enjoy plane-watching and find the environment of an airport stimulating, then you'd probably enjoy it. One thing worth mentioning though is its soundproof walls that makes sleeping possible despite being located in an airport itself.

The hotel's located at Terminal 2 where there's substantially less shopping and food choices than Terminal 1. Fret not however because there's a shuttle bus that connects you between the terminals every five minutes.

I'd say don't use this as a base hotel but it'll be perfect if you have an early morning domestic flight to catch the next morning at Haneda airport.

4,REDACTED,en,4626,"We chose to stay here because we had an early morning flight out of Narita and didn’t want to stay out at the airport. Narita is in the middle of no where with nothing to do around it.
The hotel is across the road from Tokyo station where you can access the Narita express train and most other JR and subway lines. Due to the size of Tokyo station, the Narita express line is still a 15 min walk away as it’s on the opposite side of the station to where the hotel is. All other lines are 5 to 10 mins walk from the hotel. We used Narita express as we had JR rail passes so it was free for us. If you don’t have a rail pass, you can get a bus from right out the front of the hotel and takes the same amount of time as Narita express to get to the airport. 
The hotel has great facilities and is very comfortable. Reception is on 15th floor and rooms are all below. Highly recommend if you need easy access to Narita. Ginza is 15 mins walk away",4,2018/01/10
4,REDACTED,en,4627,"This hotel was highly recommended by a good friend. After reading so many excellent reviews on this forum, I decided to try it and the excellent reviews here are true; I don't think I need to add more. Clearly this is the best hotel in its class and I've stayed in Tokyo several times. The hotel is super clean, complete ameneties (including a flat iron- must call the front desk though), room is big for a 3 starred hotel, and staff is efficient and helpful. The front desk helped me sending my luggage to Narita airport (to be picked up at the day of my departure), so that I didn't have to carry those to the bus stop. Location is convinient for Limousine bus and Keisei bus stops- all go to Narita airport. This is going to be my go to hotel from now on in Tokyo.",5,2017/10/11
4,REDACTED,en,4628,Located within easy walking distance to Tokyo Station and Nihonbashi Sattion on Ginza line made it super convenient for a few days in Tokyo. There’s an entire food and shopping hub within Tokyo station. The hotel is great and we stayed as a family of 4 in a Japanese Suite B and the kids had futon beds on tatami. Minibar and snacks were complimentary during our 3 days. This hotel has the most comprehensive collection of bathroom or room amenities of any international hotel. Beds were super comfortable but firm. To make matters even better it was the most competitively priced hotel around the New Year period of any other 4 star hotels in Tokyo.,5,2018/01/09

Please try their in-room sleeping system, guaranteed to put you to sleep in a flash. The hotel is very close to Tokyo station, if you take the Narita express, go up to the main level. There you will have two exit choices Yaesu or Marunouchi. Go to the Yaesu, regardless of north, central, or south. Once outside take a left, till you get to the Damiaru store, cross the street and you will see the Hotel Ryumeikan sign. Go up to the 15th floor for check in and restaurant. Definitely one of the best hotels I stayed at in a while.",5,2018/01/05

Our room on 13th floor afforded terrific view of the modern side of the station. Lobby was on 15th floor and the room card was required to access the guest floors.
The economy double room was small, as most Tokyo hotels are. Decoration was elegant, with good materials. Pillow menu included hypoallergenic and firm ones. However, there was no wardrobe or closet.
Bathroom was large for Japanese standard. Great powerful and hot shower. Lots of amenities which were refilled each day. Drip coffee and tea sachets (house brand) were provided with kettle. Two complimentary bottles of mineral water were provided in the fridge per night. Two packets of traditional Japanese crackers were also provided each day.",4,2017/12/24
4,REDACTED,en,4631,"QUIETNESS
As I am an extremely light sleeper, my top priority in hotel selection is the quietness. And Hotel Ryumeikan Tokyo is EXTREMELY quiet!

I hardly heard any sound in my one-week stay, though many rooms were occupied (only saw other customers at lobby and restaurant). 

As the hotel is located near the intersection of two major roads, I did hear siren a few times. But the sound is so reduced that it didn't bother me at all.

LOCATION
And speaking of location ... it's great! We took Narita Express from Narita Airport to Tokyo Station, and it took five minutes to walk (slowly) to the hotel.

One thing to note is that when I viewed hotel's website on mobile, it only mentions distance. But desktop version provides full direction with photos.

The hotel is also about 2-3 minutes' walk from Nihombashi subway station. But do note that depending on which line you take, you may need to walk many more minutes inside the station.

SERVICE
Very good! Period.

Will definitely stay there again if I go to Tokyo in the future!",5,2017/12/13

4,REDACTED,en,4635,"As I write this, I am struggling with adding up more positives to this review on the Hotel Ryumeikan. In hindsight, I should’ve gone with my first choice in the heart of Ginza and where breakfast was included, and room rate would have been less expensive. Here at Ryumeikan, I was left feeling like I paid a lot for very little. The room is indeed microscopic and barely nil space to stack a suitcase spinner for one person, let alone a couple. No space for toiletry kits in the bathroom. Breakfast at the hotel’s restaurant was an additional (about) $23USD pp. Notes included in the original reservations were never acknowledged. 

The staff were functional and offered the expected level of customer service. It’s proximity to Tokyo Station also means an easy walk through to the Marunouchi side and then on to the Imperial Palace and Gardens. A less than 10 minutes walk brings you into the heart of the Ginza District and the Tsukiji Fish Market is about 25 minutes away, if walking at a brisk pace.",3,2017/11/26
4,REDACTED,en,4636,"I booked this hotel as it was close to the train station and was highly rated. I wanted 2 room for 4 people. When booking the hotel (using booking.com - recommended by tripadvisor) the reservation say 2 x double per room. I assumed this meant 2 double beds. When we go there very small room with 1 small double bed. Now 2 x = 2 times double. The correct statement would of been 2 people 1 double bed. They seem incapable of understanding.

In addition, when we got there the hotel staff would not help us. They said there is nothing they can do. I doubt this is the first time this has happened and I would think a reputable and customer service hotel would correct the situation and future booking. The management spent more time trying to prove us wrong than helping us. I would avoid this hotel as they are incapable of performing customer service and perpetuate misleading advertising and booking techniques.",1,2017/11/22

Comfortable bed and pillows.
Bathroom with the usual high-tech Japanese toilet, tub/hand-held shower with good water pressure.
My rating would be higher if it wasn't for the following negatives:
- Inconsistent water temperature in the shower at peak times (it suddenly got cold when a guest in another room flushed the toilet or used water)
- Shower head angle not adjustable
- Complete lack of storage space for the guest's items: no available shelves, drawers, etc. (the only drawer contains the safe and various hotel items)
- Relatively early check out time at 11:00. When I asked for a late check out at 12:00 (something that hotels usually provide without charge if the room is not booked) they tried to charge me 2,000 yen (about $20) for one hour, which I declined.",4,2017/11/11

Also there is a bus that goes direct to Narita airport next to the hotel which we took and you pay the driver as you board.

4,REDACTED,en,4644,"This hotel is about a 2-3 minute walk from Tokyo Station, so cannot get any better. We also went to Tsukiji market for the auction and as it's too early for the tubes yet, we walked. It took us about 25mins so was not a problem at all and also avoided a crazily expensive cab ride. We have started and finished our 2-week long Japan trip, we stayed at this hotel in Tokyo for the first 3 nights and it was absolutely perfect. We had a Forus Semi-double designed comfort sleep room then - although tiny (just like most hotel rooms in Japan), we were not left for wanting anything more. They have the usual all signing and dancing TOTO toilets and a spacious shower cabin with a door that closes perfectly shut with a ventilator built in, which meant no more humid and musky bedroom after showers. They also provided kimono style pajamas, some shiseido cosmetics and 3 different types of pillows. It was also very quiet. We have gone back to the hotel for the last night and unknowingly got a standard bedroom. The cosmetics, design PJs and the buckwheat pillows disappeared, which would probably be predictable, but we had to ask for another room as the shower cabin was also not included, instead it was the old style shower curtain and tub, and without being able to open the window, the room was rather stinky. They did provide another room, that one refreshed so we can't complain. However we would have opted for the Forus room had we known that it would make a difference. Said that, we didn't spend much time in the room anyway. Additionally, there is a huge Daimaru with two levels of the most amazing food (from cakes to sushi to anything you could desire), which was perfect when we just wanted to pick up a few boxes of sushi or try (and be amazed) by all the different cookies and cakes. Check in and out is stress free, easy and we would definitely recommend this hotel.

I will returnn to Hotel Ryumeikan with certainly on my next trip to Tokyo.,5,2017/10/01
4,REDACTED,en,4648,"My wife and I were on our first trip to Japan together, and we were coming into Narita late off a double long-haul. So being unfamiliar with Tokyo, my priority was to find a hotel as close to Tokyo central station as possible so we wouldn't have to navigate too far away from where we got off the Narita Express.

I quickly realized that there's a steep premium for this area of Tokyo, it's where many of the famous five star hotels are located. 

Among these high-falutin hotels was nestled the Ryumeikan. It's not cheap, but it seemed to represent much better value than those around it. So I booked a ""Standard"" twin room. This was a great decision!

After crawling through the labyrinth of tunnels that is Tokyo Station, we emerged into the rain and scuttled along the street until we found the unassuming entrance of the Ryumeikan. The lobby is actually on the 15th floor and at ground level there's only an elevator... easy to miss actually.

On the 15th floor the reception staff quickly checked us in, with decent English. Payment was required in advance and my Mastercard did the job.

The ""standard"" room was great! As comfortable and spacious as any modern chain hotel. We particularly loved all the little touches like a fresh Yukata every day, fresh sleeping clothes every day, slippers, shoe/clothing deodorant, toe spreaders, foot massager, lots of face creams and amenities including shaving kit, face cream, decent shampoo and conditioner. The Japanese style short but deep bath was also great. The beds were a little firm for my wife, but perfect for me. Noise isolation was fantastic (or perhaps we had no neighbors for our 4 night stay). Wifi was fast, free and flawless, except for having to sign in again every day.

We also had a good view over the main road towards the central station. Looking at the emergency escape map, it seems our standard room was actually much bigger than most of the rooms on that floor. I guess most of the rooms are catering to single business travellers, and if I'm right, those rooms don't even get a window.

We also availed ourselves of the massage service, which was on time and efficient, right in our room (although I wasn't used to the Shiatsu massage style, but that's a different story).

We did not take breakfast at the hotel. I couldn't bring myself to pay the equivalent of almost 25 USD per person per day for breakfast, not matter how good their spread is. Instead we used the Excelsior Cafe a couple of doors down for about 7.50 USD yen each for a nice coffee and toasted ham and cheese sandwich. 

All up, if I felt the need to stay so close to Tokyo Station again, Ryumeikan would be my first choice. But I suspect you'll get even better value pushing out away from the main station.",5,2017/09/26

The desk is also well equipped with three fold mirror stand, stationary, letters and postcards. The mini bar has a lot of snack variety and tea. Plus, you also get to use the Nespresso machine for your morning coffee. 
The shower is also a pretty comfortable size. Also, the hotel has prepared all the toiletries you possibly need. (Including Shiseido skincare and makeup remover set for the beauty lovers)

4,REDACTED,en,4659,"PROS:
*LOCATION!!: My wife and I stayed here for our last night after our 5 city Japan tour before taking Narita Express back to Narita airport. We had initially flown into Narita, but stayed in Shinjiku on the first leg of our trip, but for our last night we planned for low-hassle travel back to Narita. Hotel Ryumeikan Tokyo fit the bill. As many others have said, your nearly across from Tokyo Station, and taking Yaesu NORTH Exit best and most direct. Once outside cross the intersection, and go left for 1-to-2 minutes, you'll run right into the hotel, After entering the hotel, go through double-doors and take elevator to 15th floor (Lobby).

*The Lobby has a great view, being on the 15th floor
*Staff was very accommodating during check-in
*Rooms clean & adequate in size, not huge by any means, but par for the course in Tokyo
*Price fair (when we booked)

CONS:
* Staff member at check-out was a little less enthusiastic, when we asked to have our luggage held so that we could finish up a little last-minute gift shopping. Her face clearly went from pleasant to annoyed as soon as we asked *IF our luggage could be held, and she replied: ""I think So, but can you tell me about what time until you return?"". We had regularly asked this of hotels across Japan (and elsewhere in the world), this was the first time we were made to feel like we were inconveniencing hotel staff.

4,REDACTED,en,4660,"I have stayed at the Hotel Ryumeikan many times over the years. Usually, it has been for a quick, one-night stop in Tokyo before taking the shinkansen to other destinations. But this time, I began my trip and ended my trip at the Ryumeikan; as a result, I was able to take fullest advantage of what the hotel has to offer for the first time.

The location is ideal for train travelers. Exit Tokyo Station on the Yaesu side (best exit is the Yaesu north exit next to the Daimaru department store), cross the street, turn left and walk for a minute or so and you are at the front door. The moment you enter, the elevator lobby (reception is on the 15th floor) you are greeted by the scent of incense, the kind of elegant gesture which is characteristic of the property.

Having previously stayed in the small but well thought-out standard single rooms, this time I chose the Forus rooms which are larger and more elegantly equipped with a Nespresso machine (and 8 capsules!), complimentary snacks, 4 bottles of water, high-end room slippers, robe and night shirt. Other nice touches included a foot massager, very nice green-tea scented toiletries, a great rain shower, and in the case of my Forus C room, an illuminated dry erase board for encouraging one’s creative side! Housekeeping kept the room immaculate and well stocked. If there was a downside, the room had no view; those who are strongly claustrophobic, take note.

In addition to the reception desk, the 15th floor also has a lounge area with books to borrow as well as the hotel’s restaurant Hanagoyomi. My room rate included breakfast – a large, varied buffet of Japanese delicacies. Those looking for a western breakfast will be mostly disappointed but I found the food delicious and ate much more than I should have.

As someone who has enjoyed many of Tokyo’s high-end hotels (I was a long-time devotee of the late, great Hotel Okura), my decision to stay at the Ryumeikan for my days in Tokyo was something of a lark. But I am glad I did. While not one of the city’s highest-end luxury properties, the Ryumeikan nevertheless provides its guests with caring, thoughtful hospitality in a prime location. I will be returning at my next opportunity.",5,2017/08/12

Many restaurants surround the hotel, often frequented by office workers after work. Tokyo Station had many shops and restaurants including a pizza restaurant and McDonalds.

I would definitely consider returning to explore this place further, especially when it is located so centrally.",5,2017/07/31
4,REDACTED,en,4664,"Location was very convenient though not linked to Tokyo JR station. Near the Nihonbashi and the Otemachi main subway lines. Very convenient when coming in via the Narita Express and for going by subway to the attractions. We were catching a shinkensen the following day for Hakodate. It was an easy stroll across the road.

Room was very decent sized for Tokyo. Amenities were of good quality; and wifi decent. 

Enjoyed ourselves immensely. Would definitely want to stay here again.",5,2017/07/23
4,REDACTED,en,4665,"I wanted to try the chou district this time,
the room was very very small, not even a shelf to put your clothes on.
the location is OK not exceptionally good.
last time I stayed in shimbashi I thought it was a better location, I had a much bigger room and the price was better.
the nice thing was the tea in the lobby.",3,2017/07/20
4,REDACTED,en,4666,"This hotel was a major disappointment. The room was absolutely tiny, even by Tokyo standards. Was clean, but apart from that really had nothing else going for it. The staff at the front desk were uninterested and dismissive almost to the point of being rude.

The great thing about the hotel is the location. It's just 2 minutes walk from Tokyo station and easy to find (so long as you go out of the station at the correct exit). 

If all you require is a bed immediately across from the station then this hotel will serve you well. If you require anything more then I'm sure you can find much better.",2,2017/07/07
4,REDACTED,en,4667,"Just a couple blocks down from the Yaesu North exit of the Tokyo station, this is a nice hotel. The breakfast buffet ($23.00 per person) was nice and I enjoyed trying some new dishes. The employees were friendly and helpful although English is somewhat limited but in the end we communicated just fine. The rooms are clean and comfortable but a little small when compared to U.S. hotel rooms.",5,2017/06/30
4,REDACTED,en,4668,"In Tokyo for a few days picked this hotel randomly. We wanted wanted something close to the train station with everything being accessible. It was a great find had eveything we needed and more including a place to do your laundry. It had kimono's, slippers, and all the toiletries you could think of. We would definitely recommend it.",4,2017/06/28
4,REDACTED,en,4669,"The initial check in experience was not a very good one at all, and after a very long day of flying, trains and walking with 2 suitcases, I was looking for a friendly face.......I did not find one. 
The room was not much bigger than my closet at home, there was literally no room for my 2 suitcases so I had to rearrange the place each morning just so I could open the door and get out the door. 
None of that compared to my checkout experience. As I expected, my meetings concluded and I needed to check out early, and I told them that may happen when I checked in. I was driving back from a meeting and called the hotel around 11:15-11:30 to let them know I was checking out and would be there within a short time for the bill. They needed to credit my credit card for my other days. I arrived at the desk around 13:30. 
The girl I spoke to did not understand English enough to help me and wanted to charge me the entire next night, which I did not agree to. After some back and forth I asked for the manager and she hesitantly asked a man named [--] to try and assist. It took about 30 minutes of convincing him that I was not told about the cancellation policy when I checked in, and I mentioned the fact that I specifically asked about leaving early and was told I would just get a refund for the remaining nights. He finally gave in but insisted he charge me 7500 Yen for a late checkout because I had been standing there arguing with him. 
On top of that I was charged an entire night stay because I checked in around 10.30 am, so in total I was overcharged around 27,500 Yen. I told them I was referred to them, but I can guarantee I would not be referring them to any of my contacts, and I would be emailing the GM of the hotel. 
I travel all over the world and I am very big on customer service. This hotel did not show that from the time I arrived until after I had gone. I will not be using it again.",2,2017/06/26
4,REDACTED,en,4670,The photos don't do this place justice. It's a Japanese style hotel but there was a lot more room than I expected so close to Tokyo station and the fit out was modern. It easily fitted our portacot and stuff and the desk area was big enough to be useable. No view but the room was very reasonably priced. Staff were very good and their English seemed good too although my husband speaks Japanese so we didn't have to test it. Very accommodating at breakfast of our 1yo.,5,2017/06/26
4,REDACTED,en,4671,"Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. Location was perfect as it is very close to the train station. We were there when the cherry blossoms were in full bloom & we saw a spectacular display of blossoms close to the hotel.

We would stay here again next time we're in Tokyo.",5,2017/06/23

Each high level has ice machine, washing machine and dryer (only 300yen) and drink machine with reasonable price. I booked at last minute and can only get a small room, just found the chair is relatively big compared with the room size, bit convenient to move around. Overall, very happy stay of 2 nights. Will go back for sure.",5,2017/06/14
4,REDACTED,en,4673,"I visit Tokyo frequently and this hotel has always been my first choice. The location is super convenient, staff very professional and friendly, the rooms are not huge but the fine attention to detail makes it very comfortable to stay. Also it is worthwhile to try their breakfast, loaded with local delicacies! Highly recommended",5,2017/06/08
4,REDACTED,en,4674,"The hotel is very close to the train station, which makes it perfect for travel within Japan. The room was spacious for Japan standards, and had all amenities you could wish for. The in-room coffee was Nescafe, a nice change from bad hotel coffee!",5,2017/05/29
4,REDACTED,en,4675,"This has become my go-to hotel whenever I am in Tokyo. It's in a very convenient location, with easy access to Tokyo Station, Marunouchi and the Nihonbashi areas on foot. There are many food options around with Daimaru located at Tokyo Station and KITTE across from the Marunouchi South Exit.

The hotel is also 5 mins away from the nearest Metro entrance where you can take the Ginza line to Shibuya and Omotesando at one end and Asakusa on the other.

The hotel may seem pricey but given its convenience for a solo traveler, I will definitely go back to it again and again.",4,2017/05/16
4,REDACTED,en,4676,"We stayed in total 5 nights for Cherry Blossom Trip include Tokyo, Northern East Japan. This is our second time to stay here and it seem our first choice when we stay in Tokyo.

Of course, location next to Tokyo Station and a Airport Shuttle Station just next to hotel entrance. 

And the room provided good environment with men and ladies consumable. I would like to say that the razor provided is one of the best hotel provided razor so far.

Last but not least, we recommend to pay for the breakfast and you would find that each details of the disc is not standard buffet breakfast. Every morning, I am happy to see the Japanese egg roll made by chef in fresh and delicious.

The staff also make us memorable services. During our check in is rainy day and we cannot open umbrella from Tokyo station to hotel. So all we are wet, When we check-in, staff gave us a warm towel to clean our hands and other white towel to make our hair and body dry. All these services provided efficiency and elegant.

I would recommend this hotel to any person who need stay close to Tokyo Station and further travel to other area of Japan.",5,2017/05/03
4,REDACTED,en,4677,"Most important thing about this hotel is it's location. 3 minute walk to the major Tokyo station from where all the main Shinkansen trains start and terminate. Bus to Narita and Haneda airport are just outside the hotel. There is a family mart to buy the basic things and a major electronic store to buy SIM cards and other things. Daimaru dept store is in the station building. Room is small but that is everywhere in Japan. Bathroom amenities are very good and the best shower in the world after a tiring day. Lots of eateries nearby. I can easily recommend this hotel, a bit on the pricier side but that is became of its location.",4,2017/05/01
4,REDACTED,en,4678,"I stayed 4 nights in a Forus C room, which was more spacious than I expected and very comfortable for me traveling alone (would assuredly be enough for 2). There were nice amenities (including snacks and a Nespresso machine) and the large shower stall was terrific. 

I had lunch in the hotel restaurant which was nice, and the hotel front desk staff were helpful and efficient. Their English was good enough to get done what I needed to do. The reception desk and lobby are on the 15th floor, with hotel rooms lower floors; when you walk in the building there's an elevator lobby for the hotel separate from the elevator to the rest of the building's offices. When you walk through the doors of that elevator lobby there is quiet and subtle incense that makes it a lovely change from the busy streets of Tokyo. 

The location is perfect: The hotel is about a 5-7 minute walk from Tokyo station and about a 7-10 minute walk to the Nihombashi station on the Metro line, and from those 2 locations I could easily go wherever I wanted to go in the city, including the Tsukiji Market, Akihabara, and Ueno Park.",4,2017/04/30
4,REDACTED,en,4679,Hotel is 5 min walk away to Tokyo station. Booked hotel as we wanted to travel early next morning to Kyoto by Shinkansen. Movement within room limited if have 2-3 big suitcases. A lot of good amenities provided.,4,2017/04/29
4,REDACTED,en,4680,"We stayed two nights in a Focus C double room and enjoyed our stay. The room size was not large but was rather decent by Tokyo standards as it could still accommodate a small sofa. We found the room to be very clean and the bathroom was nicely appointed with quality toiletries. The toilet bowl even had auto open and close functions. The double bed was comfortable but be forewarned that it might not be large enough if both adults are big sized. The bed had a drawer at the bottom where an in-room safe was housed. There is a Nespresso machine for coffee. Everything in the room looked new.

There was also a white board with markers in the room for guests to pen their thoughts. Thought that was quite interesting! 

Location-wise, it was great as it was a short walk from Tokyo Station. Take the Yaesu North Exit, pass Daimaru Department Store on your left and cross the road. Turn left and the hotel is just a couple of blocks down and opposite the Shangri-La Hotel. There are a number of eateries around the hotel and Cafe Excelsior is next door.

For the price we paid, it was a steal considering that it is very close to Tokyo Station. We have stayed in various hotels in Tokyo (this was our sixth visit) and would recommend that you consider this hotel because it is value for money.",5,2017/04/26
4,REDACTED,en,4681,"Stayed in the Forus C room here with my wife and 1.5yo. Plenty of space with great features. The whiteboard is a cute touch, and the Nespresso machine was a hit with my wife. Location is also great: next to the Keisei airport bus stop, about a 5 min walk to Tokyo station (Yaesu side), and about a 15min walk to Ginza.",5,2017/04/25
4,REDACTED,en,4682,"I stayed in two different rooms (budget). One of them was their second-cheapest category and offered a lot of space so I would recommend that as better value. None of the rooms had a view (in fact, not even day light). However, the place is exceptionally clean, tidy, modern and well-equipped. The beds felt brand new and of highest standard (firm). Staff were very nice too so all-round an outstanding hotel.",5,2017/04/24
4,REDACTED,en,4683,"We stayed 1 night before heading out to Kyoto in the standard twin room. The room was very small, but it is quite standard in japan. It was neat, clean and comfortable.

So in sum, i had a pleasant stay.",5,2017/04/24
4,REDACTED,en,4684,"We stayed there during spring break on a way home just for one night. We choose triple room which was very specious. Proximity to Tokyo Station is huge bonus as it's easy to connect to/from airport ( as well at the doorstep it's Airport Bus) , subway and major train station. Room was very well equipped with all amenities ( inc Nescafé coffee machine). As we stayed only for one night we haven't checked all hotel facilities. Next door there are plenty nice restaurants to try on. We enjoyed our short stay.",5,2017/04/21

The rooms are smallish, as expected, but well appointed and with a Kurig coffee/tea maker and all the delightful amenities we found in all the Japanese hotels. The location across from the Station (exit near the Daimaru Dept Store and look left to see the top of the hotel) provided ready access to the JR ticket office,city/local/national trains and a subway stop (a different stop is around the corner). Additionally the Station and Diamaru have many, varied and good restaurants. The hotel reception staff were kind and accommodating and there was always someone who spoke English at the desk. There was a great view from the top floor lobby and spaces to relax and try some interesting complimentary teas.",5,2017/04/20
4,REDACTED,en,4687,"I booked this hotel for one night because of its proximity to Tokyo Station which made it easy to get to the airport in the morning. The outside of the hotel and its foyer on the 15th floor are fairly nondescript. However, my room was modern, nicely decorated with discreet Japanese touches and came with a lovely Japanese print robe, PJs and a wealth of toiletaries. My floor had a washer and dryer which were free to use. The only quibble I had was the softly whistling air-condioner. Also don't expect views.",4,2017/04/20
4,REDACTED,en,4688,"I chose this hotel for my 3 nights stay after reading mostly positive reviews in tripadvisor site. However, this is simply not the case in reality. This hotel has the worst front desk service I've experienced in my recent years of travel.

I got sick in my arrival unfortunately. In times, I'll ask the front desk for assistance, such as directions and room availability/rates if I want to extend my stay so I can rest. Some of the front desk staffs are pretentious and insincere. When ask a question, they have an annoyed/irritated look on their faces, despite their best attempt to hide it. And they gave me different information on room rates and availability everyday which made me very confusing. On 2nd day they told me there's zero room availability, but on the 3rd day I asked another staff, she offered me a much more expensive room for extended stay. I have no choice but to accept it and told them I will do the transaction next day.

Later that night, my illness got worse and unbearable. I decided to cancel my extended stay and went to the airport to try get an earlier flight home. In the morning as I told them I'm leaving and would like to cancel the new room reservation, a female staff in her early forties was agitated. She raised her voice and talked to me in a harsh and hostile tone, blaming me for not telling her earlier and said that I would have to pay for cancellation charges in my future stay. I apologized and explained to her politely about my illness condition with my hoarse voice, she didn't even care and gave me a cold hard stare, then looking at her monitor with dead silence. No sympathy for a sick guest, no basic courtesy farewell to a paying guest. I took a glance at her before heading to the lift, saw her blabbering to her colleague about me. Very unprofessional and rude.

I am extremely disappointed and disgusted by the services provided by hotel Ryumeikan Tokyo. Japan is a country well known for it's hospitality and manners, but sadly it doesn't exist in this hotel. I've strongly urged my friends and co-workers to stay in other better hotels near Tokyo Station, because I don’t wish anyone else to receive the poor treatment I had in Ryumeikan.",1,2017/04/19
4,REDACTED,en,4689,"Like other reviews have already stated Hotel Ryumeikan is a short walk away from the Nihombishi station and Tokyo station. Tokyo station is a hub for the metro line, JR Train lines, Shinkansen, and Narita Express. Next to the hotel is a Family Mart convenience store and the nearest 7/11 is about five minutes away (important for withdrawing money with your debit card!). No complaints about the staff per the norm in Japanese service culture. The room was very modern and the amenities were good. To summarize some of the notable amenities: washlet, beauty/grooming toiletries, kimono/pajamas, water bottles, snacks, post cards, wi fi. The hotel also has a laundry room and vending machines. I would say this hotel is in an ideal location for most travelers and highly recommend it.",5,2017/04/17

We forgot our wifi hotspot in our taxi and they were very helpful in helping us find it! (Always make sure to save your taxi receipts in Japan!!) Room was perfect for one person & they had every type of toiletries provided that you would need. Also held my luggage after and before check out! Good room for a good price. Wish I got to eat at the restaurant! If I ever visit Japan again, I would definitely stay here!",5,2017/04/16

Rooms were spacious, very clean and with nice amenities.",5,2017/04/12

Thanks you for that!!

4,REDACTED,en,4696,"Ryumeikan hotel is located just across Yaesu North Exit of Tokyo Station. If you are taking airport limousine bus from either Narita or Haneda, the bus will stop at Tekko Building which is right across the hotel. So, hotel's location is very strategic. Check-in lobby is at 15th Floor with reasonably nice view from the top. Payment for hotel charges have to be made up-front upon check-in. Standard room size is big enough for single traveller. You can easily find eating places around the hotel, just go to the alleys next to the hotel. Convenient stores like 7-11, Lawson, and Family Mart are plenty around the hotel.",4,2017/04/06
4,REDACTED,en,4697,"Stayed one night at the Ruymeikan. Perfect for my needs, one night near Tokyo Station for a day-and-a-half whirlwind exploration of Tokyo.

Room was small but functional with a comfortable double bed (big enough for one unless you and partner are either very close or very small or both) and full bath. Noise transmission from next door was annoying. Fortunately, my neighbours knocked off early.

Plus: excellent location for getting around. Easy access to Tokyo Station and all rail lines to various points in the city. Staff were helpful in storing my luggage before check-in (2 pm) and after checkout (11 am) but they were zealous in making sure I adhered to these times!

Minus: Not a lot of extras! Don't expect a whole lot and you won't be disappointed. 

Conclusion: Not bad for the cost.",3,2017/04/03
4,REDACTED,en,4698,"I was in town for some business in the Ginza area. Therefore, this hotel was chosen for its short distance from Ginza and JR Tokyo Station. Little did I know that it would be so much more conveniently located than I expected. There were several major department stores and countless good restaurants around. The hotel was just across the street from Daimaru Department Store and was easy to locate. Being next to the Tokyo Station also meant that one could get anywhere in Tokyo easily from there.

The hotel was on the luxurious side -- I got a good deal and big discount online and had one of the smaller rooms with no view. That did not bother me at all. The room was nicely appointed and well equipped. There were bottles of water, snacks, and even a Nespresso machine with capsules -- perfect for a tired traveler who had just arrived. The room itself was very clean. The bathroom was excellent -- very well stocked with all you'd need for the stay. The shower system was great -- with several shower options available -- and the water pressure was great as well. It would have been even better if there was a safe.

The room does have a very interesting system, which turned off the light and sound gradually when you activated it before sleeping, and turned on the light and sound gradually when the alarm was set. Very fascinating system -- saved me the hassle of fiddling with light switches before sleep.

The reception was located on the top floor, which was a nice touch actually. At night, one could enjoy tea (provided there for free) while watching the lights and city outside the windows.

The service there was excellent as well -- very patient and efficient.

All in all, it was a wonderful stay at Hotel Ryumeikan for me.",5,2017/04/02
4,REDACTED,en,4699,"We loved our stay at Ryumeikan Tokyo. We both had been to Tokyo a few times (my husband lived in Tokyo for a bit as well), and we were struggling to pick one area to stay in. 

Hotel Ryumeikan Tokyo was a perfect choice for us as it was right next to the Tokyo Station, meaning we ended up not having to choose! Everywhere in Tokyo is very easily accessible from Tokyo Station; in short, if you're not planning on focusing your Tokyo trip on a single area, Hotel Ryumeikan Tokyo presents the perfect base. 

The hotel itself was absolutely perfect - spotlessly clean, service was excellent, and it even has a fantastic breakfast buffet that allows you to do ""kaiseki"" type meal. For a Japanese hotel, the room was also very spacious! All in all, we would definitely stay at Hotel Ryumeikan Tokyo again next time we are in town.",5,2017/04/01
4,REDACTED,en,4700,"Chose hotel to rest for the night when we flew into Haneda past 10 pm, before heading for Toyama on the Shinkansen the next morning. Typical of Tokyo hotels, the room is rather small with double bed, and the window faced a wall, which did not matter. However we had nespresso coffee machine, two choices of night wear, complete set of toiletries for both men and women, which included skincare - we should not have bothered to pack ours. The bed came with mood music and lighting that got me engrossed and fiddling when I should be resting instead. We asked for humidifier and iron and ironing board to press our clothing. Not much space in the room to do this though. However the toilet and shower facilities were impressive, though there was no bath - which did not matter to us. Being presbyopic, however, it would help to make those bidet choices easier for non-kanji readers. Tokyo station was a stroll away. We were also informed of airport bus limousine to Haneda in a building across the road, which was very useful for us because it rained on our departure day. We saw quite a few people waiting at the bus stop in the open for a different company service. 
We came back to rest for another night when we came back from our 4 day stay at Toyama. Though the room was small, we had a restful last night stay. We left one luggage there while we were away. Kind of look forward to come back to Ryumeikan but this time, maybe a bigger room.",4,2017/04/01

Only grouse I have was the concierge mis-directed me to walk to the Keisei office (in the rain) to buy tickets for next day bus to Narita airport. When I got to the office they told me I cannot buy tickets and should just go direct to the bus stop. Please note this if you are planning to take the Keisei bus back to airport (bus stop in front of Ryumeikan). 

Having read the good reviews on the service, was surprised that the concierge / front desk was not more friendly, and also made me walk in the rain for nothing. But otherwise an acceptable stay and will stay again if travelling by Shinkansen.",4,2017/03/27

We booked last minute so not many rooms types available. Best deal for us was via agoda.com. Check in was smooth and very friendly at 10pm which was much appreciated after a full day of travel with the kids.

We stayed in 2 semi doubles 1adult 1child in each room in a double bed. Rooms were well presented, immaculate, modern, reasonable size with great size bathroom for Tokyo packed with amenities.
Wifi works great too! Kimonos on the bed were fun for the kids! 

Great location to Tokyo Station only a few minutes walk with kids and bags in tow once outside the station and easy to find. 

Take Yaesu North Exit, then Diamaru walkway, turn left when outside the station, cross over the road at the crossing and it's not even 1 block. Look up for the white neon sign on top of the building and next door is a mini mart with a big green and white stripe neon sign Reception is on the 15th floor. 

Would definitely stay here again for overnight transfers and exploring tokyo via the metro or buses.

The location is very near to Tokyo Station and It is easy to get around. Lots of restaurants at Tokyo station and in nearby streets. And of course nearby to daimaru.

4,REDACTED,en,4712,"So I do owe everyone a few reviews, but let me start with my trip to Japan. Started out as a couples trip but that changed when our daughter's due date conflicted with the trip. We went from a couple's trip to three guys. The schedule was Tokyo for 2,nights at the Palace hotel, 2 nights at the new Four Seasons in Kyoto then a plane ride from Osaka to the island of Hokkaido for 5 days of skiing. Who knew that skiing in Japan is awesome. We skied in Niseko, get the all mountain pass and have a great time. Lift tickets, rentals are cheap compared to the U.S. We had a guide each day, and it was worth it.
So I digress, Tokyo was awesome, had a dinner at Nakahara, great grilled meats at the table,get the legendary Waygu beef tongue, have to order in advance, but it was phenomenal!! The Chef was born in the U.S. In San Jose then the family moved back to Japan when he was 4. Went to Sushi bar Yasuda. It is Yasuda-San, the Chef, his wife and their daughter, Junior, who take care of you. A great place to go, everyone wants to go to Jiro but this guy is the real deal. Narrow staircase to walk down to the restaurant but really worth it, and sit at the counter. He knows his sushi and his rice! Also in Tokyo, restaurant Takazawa, unbelievable 8-9 seat restaurant that is off the charts,if you can get in please go, and it is not cheap. And they have a crazy good wine list that Thatcher has put together. We had a 2014,Ramonet, a 2009 Lignier, and a 1988 Gaja speers. Cool place, cool people. They also have a bar downstairs if you want something a little more casual. Oh yeah, go by the fish market, Tsukiji and the shops/restaurants around it. And stop by the knife store, they hand make their knives and sell to Chefs...the name is Tsukiji Masamoto, I bought knives there and wished I had bought more.
I was very impressed by the respect everyone shows to everyone else, and how clean the cities were. In Kyoto we had dinners at Kappo Sakamoto and Tempura Matsu. If you go you will experience Kyoto dining as no one else does. Tempura Matsu had a wonderful menu and only a couple of tempura dishes but they were light a delicious. Kappo Sakamoto was a total delight, a son, the Chef and his Mother run this small jewel of a place, maybe 6-9 seats at the counter, tough to find but enchanting.
Hope you can enjoy what I did.
All the best!!",5,2017/03/01
4,REDACTED,en,4713,"we stayed here for 6 nights, very close to Tokyo station and the JR trains, so brilliant location. Also impeccable discreet service! Feels like a 4* in terms of cleanliness, comfort and service but remains 3* in terms of facilities (no pool etc). So if you're looking for a base to explore the city and want to come back to a relaxing clean room, then this is the place.",5,2017/02/20
4,REDACTED,en,4714,"We stayed here in January 2017 as a one night stopover before taking the shinkansen up to Shiga kogen. The hotel is only maybe a 5 minute walk from Tokyo station and is easily found.
The front desk was helpful and directed us to izakaya/yakitori close by in the streets next to the hotel.
The rooms are small, as typical of Japanese hotels, but clean and adequate.
For the price, it is quite reasonable indeed for our purposes (just 1 night rest, then off early in the morning).",4,2017/02/13
4,REDACTED,en,4715,Great hotel. However room is a bit small but able to accommodate the bags and stuff. Well organized in terms of space planning. Ambience quiet. Near very near Tokyo station and easily accessible to everywhere.,5,2017/02/07
4,REDACTED,en,4716,"We stayed 4 nights, you can't beat the location and easy walk to Tokyo station and the JR trains, Metro station is across the road. We had 2 separate booking and we discovered there are different types of standard rooms, which was not obvious on the Agoda site I used to book. If you can get the room with the rain shower, so much better and well worth the 2000 yen difference per night. The bathroom and choice of a amenities is far superior. The shower room is large, the other was a standard shower over a bath. This room has a coffee pod machine, the other instant coffee. The bed while small in both rooms, in the rain shower room you have a small bench next to the wall, while the other the bed is hard against it. The rain shower room has space for hanging clothes and room for storing suitcases.",5,2017/02/04
4,REDACTED,en,4717,"Stayed here for a night in a double room before flying out of Tokyo after travelling through Japan. Have to say I wished I had stayed here for my previous Tokyo stay. Location is unbeatable; Hotel Ryumeikan is 2 minutes walk from Tokyo station (JR Yaesu Northern exit) - you can actually see the hotel as you walk out of the station. There are two Tokyo metro stations nearby (both walking distances) as well. Not only that, staff are kind, friendly and very approachable. Rooms are kept clean and decor simple which create relaxing atmosphere. May find rooms slightly smaller than other luxury hotels but they are very well equipped and comes with a variety of amenities which means you really need not carry anything else. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone travelling to Tokyo.",5,2017/02/02
4,REDACTED,en,4718,"Hotel Ryumeikan is a small hotel that can beat the bigger luxury hotels in terms of location, service and value for money. We stayed 9 nights in connecting twin rooms that were spacious and looked like they had been refurbished not too long ago. The fancy Toto Washlet with automatic lid and flushing system in the premium corner room was a pleasant surprise.

Getting around Tokyo and traveling to Tokyo Disney Resort, Gala Yuzawa and Narita Airport was a breeze as Tokyo and Nihombashi stations are both within walking distance. The Keisei bus stop is almost at the hotel's doorstep while the Airport Limousine stop is across the road.

What really impressed us the most about Hotel Ryumeikan is the service. Our e-mail enquiries were answered promptly and restaurant reservations were made within a few hours from the time we e-mailed our requests. Thank you Shiori-san for your assistance. Front desk staff were approachable and helpful and the housekeeping team is excellent. 

This hotel really tries hard to meet the needs of its guests. You can leave behind your toiletries as everything you will need is provided for in addition to a yukata and pyjamas. There's also a coin-operated washer and dryer on the 12th floor. Sound proofing is excellent.",5,2017/01/28

4,REDACTED,en,4720,"We stayed in Tokyo for 4 days and we stayed in this hotel. The location was perfect since it was adjacent to Tokyo station (<10 minute walk) and walking distance to Imperial Palace grounds. It was a tad tricky to find, but you go inside the building from the street and there is an elevator to the left and the hotel is floors 8-15 with reception being on 15. Highly recommend.",5,2017/01/24
4,REDACTED,en,4721,"This is the second time we stayed at the Ryumeikan. Location is first class, rooms are lovely, beds are firm and comfy. Bathrooms are located very. Having a Nespresso machine with capsules in the room is a nice touch. The staff are wonderfully welcoming. 

Direct access to and from Narita by Narita Express and bus. Extremely convenient for JR, Shinkansen and metro. Really, the location couldn't be better- plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby, Concept Lani building is virtually next door for all the new gadgets, electronics and home appliances, Tokyu Hands and Daimaru across the road in the station complex. 

For the area, prices are reasonable and you can get good deals on hotel booking websites. Highly recommended!",5,2017/01/23
4,REDACTED,en,4722,"10-15 min from Tokyo station. Rooms quite big for Tokyo standards. Stayed 1 night n loved the modern n very clean rooms. On our level, there was a room for water / beer dispenser. Can buy movies from a ticketing machine here too. Shower was nice n loved the auto toilets. Also next to a subway line.",4,2017/01/17
4,REDACTED,en,4723,"The Ryumeikan is across the street from the north or central exits (Yausu North) from the Tokyo Station. Cross at the large scatter crossing, turn left past the big electronics store and it is about another 75 m on your right. To catch the Haneda bus, turn right as you leave the hotel, walk to the lights, about 20m, cross and then double back in front of the black Tekko (?) building. The bus station is under the portico-style entrance and has a large waiting area. The bus to Haneda International Terminal takes about 40 minutes and leaves about every 40 - 50 minutes. Tokyo Station opens up the rest of Japan to you and if you are using a JR pass, the access to the station from the Ryumeikan is just fantastic and could not be beaten.
There is an excellent Daimaru with a great food and delicatessen area around the north entrance to the station, along with a vast number of other shops, so provisioning your food for a days travel is easy.
We had a room classed as a ""semi-double"" on the 11th floor which means that the bed is pushed up against the headboard and one wall or side-board, so access is a bit restricted, but by Tokyo standards, the size of the rest of the room and the layout was really quite good. There was no view from our window, just buildings, but that didn't worry us as we were out all of the day. The bathroom was good, but did not have a bath but did have an excellent shower recess. The standard of housekeeping and the in-room coffee maker made this a very welcome place to return to after a long day.
Overall we were delighted with this hotel and found the staff to be very helpful.",5,2017/01/11
4,REDACTED,en,4724,"Our bus service from Narita airport was able to drop us off literally at the hotel doorstep. From there, concierge took care of our luggage and provided info on places to go for NYE in Tokyo. The hotel also offered free noodles in the evening to celebrate the ""year crossing"" (see photo). The following morning for new year's tradition, the hotel hosted a mochi-making demonstration at the lobby with complimentary mochi tasting afterwards.",5,2017/01/10
4,REDACTED,en,4725,"This is Japan. So everything is fine. Service is nice, rooms are clean, toilet is cosmic. We were there during march holidays in 2013. Location is best - you can transfer in any destination. The only minus is that room is small.",5,2017/01/10
4,REDACTED,en,4726,"This hotel is right across the road from Tokyo station so very easy to access from the airport - we took the Narita Express train but there is the bus stop right out the front if that is your preferred option.
Reception is located on the 15th floor & the check in process was quick & efficient. We needed two rooms so booked one economy & one standard. For slightly more $$ the standard is much better value being a bigger room with better amenities (eg coffee machine, kettle, nicer bathroom products). 
The hotel is surrounded by loads of restaurants, shops & attractions. We walked to the Imperial Palace gardens, Ginza & the kids loved Character Street which is located underneath Tokyo station.
We loved our stay at this hotel & would recommend to anyone looking for a reasonably priced hotel (by Tokyo standards) in a first class location!",5,2017/01/08
4,REDACTED,en,4727,"Our 2nd stay in the hotel. We stayed in the larger ""Art"" room this time as the regular rooms are quite small. Whats unique and surprising is that the room has a backlit whiteboard for drawing!

Same as last time, the hotel has good service and good location near Tokyo Station. A very comfortable hotel. Only downside is the small room size, which is almost universal for hotels in Tokyo.

Room facilities are quite thoughtful. A universal power plug is provide on the bedside, a convenient installation for oversea travellers. The disposable slippers the hotel provided are comfortable and of better quality, and even encourages you to take them for reuse on the plane.",5,2017/01/08
4,REDACTED,en,4728,We enjoyed 4 nights at the Hotel Ryumeikan in late December. The hotel is well located and is a short walk away from the main railway station.The room was a typical size for central Tokyo but more than big enough for a couple and well appointed. Reception is on the top floor and the rooms are below that level. The rooms are comfortable and well maintained and represent good value for money for the location.,4,2017/01/07
4,REDACTED,en,4729,"Rather small but nice and fully equipped room. Very good location, and very close (maybe 30 m from the entrance) to the stop of the shuttle bus between Tokyo Station and Narita Airport. We found much more practical and convenient to take the shuttle rather than the Narita Express Train.",5,2017/01/05
4,REDACTED,en,4730,"Perfect hotel location for exploring the cities of Tokyo. Very close to Tokyo Central Station (railway and subway and Narita Express to airport). Also very close to stations on multiple subway lines outside the TCS. You can reach almost all parts of Tokyo from this central hub within 40 minutes. Hotel rooms are not overwhelming in size, but well equipped and very functional. Service-minded staff will try their best to help out on all sorts of problems you might run into. Reasonable room rates. Great number of restaurants within walking distance.",5,2017/01/03
4,REDACTED,en,4731,"We were staying only one night in Tokyo, transiting from Nagano back home, so we wanted some place close to the Tokyo Station. This really fit the bill. It is a 10min walk from the shinkansen and Narita Express. You simply cross the road and walk down by Daimaru towards the JR East station. Along the way, there are tonnes of restaurants and bars both above and below ground. Daimaru is also a great place to pick up gifts if you've forgotten them. The underground passageway is also chock full of stuff to buy. 

The hotel itself is rather small, with a tiny lobby. Efficient staff, friendly and accommodating. I had tried to book a triple room but they were full, so had to settle for a twin room. Didn't realize that you have to pay per person - i.e. each child 6 and above is counted as an adult, so we actually had to pay for 4 persons for the twin room. The front desk people were really nice though and waived the kids' charge for the night (it would have come to about $500USD for a small twin room). But families should note this before booking. 

The rooms are pretty standard but very large for Tokyo. It fit two beds and a sofa, plus a desk and chair! We've been in twin rooms where you couldn't open your luggage. This one fit our family of four amply. The bathroom is also comfortably large with good amenities. 

Around the hotel is a bunch of great noodle shops, yakitori joints and izakayas. We had a great time wandering around but get there early with kids as the restaurants fill out really fast. It's also a straight, short walk to Ginza and more shopping! You can't go wrong with Ryumeikan.",4,2016/12/30
4,REDACTED,en,4732,We spent out first two nights in Japan at Hotel Ryumeikan and it was a perfect choice! Very easy to walk to after taking the Narita Express to Tokyo station and an excellent base for getting to places. The service was gracious and the room very well equipped; also a convenience store close by and shopping within easy reach. We had dinner at the restaurant the last night and it offered and excellent introduction to Japanese cuisine. Highly recommended!,5,2016/12/23
4,REDACTED,en,4733,"With my family, I stayed a total of 7 nights at this lovely hotel. The room rates are quite reasonable. We stayed at the Corner Deluxe Room which is well appointed, bright, clean and cosy and with lovely view. Staff speak good English and are very helpful and attentive. This hotel is well position at Tokyo Station, very convenient, plenty of eateries surroundings. Another plus point is that the Airport limousine coach operating to and from Narita/Haneda is just across the road (Tekko Building), or if you travel light, you can hop-on the airport coach just in-front of the hotel.",4,2016/12/21
4,REDACTED,en,4734,"Decided this Hotel after reading reviews. Staff here were helpful and it's location to Tokyo Station makes it quite easy to get around especially if new to the city and figuring out the train system. Beds may be too firm for some as in case for my wife but I found them fine.

Basically, this is a super convenient hotel in a great location, small but comfortable rooms with nice amenities and staff are hospitable. Will definitely revisit on our next trip to Tokyo.",5,2016/12/21
4,REDACTED,en,4735,"Not only is this hotel super convenient in terms of location, but its small but comfortable rooms are well-appointed with everything you could possibly need - from a nice bed and yukata to plentiful shampoo etc. Our room on the 14th floor had a great view of the street and Tokyo Station. The staff are very hospitable and welcoming, providing request cards for you to communicate if you need something (like extra towels as we did). They had a helpful laundry service that I used (costs extra, but worth it), or laundry machines if you want to do your own laundry (also costs extra). We had a package delivered to the hotel, and it was there when we arrived. Great experience, and this will be our go-to hotel next time we come to Tokyo!",5,2016/12/19
4,REDACTED,en,4736,"I cannot recommend this hotel enough to my college and friends.

I stayed here twice and both times were fantastic.
The staff was polite and professional.
The location was fantastic both for those who travel by plane or train as it's within walking distance from Tokyo central station.

There was a lot of restaurant nearby and convenient store just located beside the hotel.
2-3 minutes walk to subway just awesome.

The room was nice and adequate with everything I need during my stay.

all in all, I had a wonderful stay and would like to stay in here again anytime I hit Tokyo.",5,2016/12/16
4,REDACTED,en,4737,"We were arriving late into Tokyo and catching a train to Kyoto the next morning, so we needed somewhere near the train station that was going to be easy to find and easy to get to. Hotel Ryumeikan fit this perfectly. A very comfortable and clean hotel, it is very conveniently located near JR Tokyo station. We paid for a double room and were very pleased with the size and space of the room.",4,2016/12/15
4,REDACTED,en,4738,"I had booked the hotel so that we could be close to the Tokyo station as we were flying back to Australia the next day. This was one of the (very) few hotels that had a room capable of having all four of us in it (2A, 2C).

The check in process was seamless, the room beautiful, the bathroom amenities varied and heaps of them, free drinks in the fridge, a Nespresso machine, plus lots of other little extras. 

The hotel kindly looked after our luggage after we checked out for a few hours as our flight didn't depart until early evening.

I've never paid this much for a hotel room before ($800Aus), so it was a real treat, however the alternatives were limited and would have required us to book two rooms at over $300 each, so overall we thought it was good value.",5,2016/12/14
4,REDACTED,en,4739,"Hotel Ryumeikan does a lovely job hitting the sweet spot between location, price, and room size.

Location: 10 minutes from getting off the train from Narita to the front desk. Next to Tokyo station, short walk to the imperial palace, 30 minute walk to the fish market. 25 minute walk to Kikanbo ramen (plus, the Tokyo station ramen street is near by)
Price: More than reasonable 
Room size: Comfortable with good size bathrooms

I'd stay here again in a heart beat...",5,2016/12/11
4,REDACTED,en,4740,"This hotel is definitely worthy of its high rating. Staff are polite and friendly, with quite good english. They are able to receive and send luggage via the Yamato (black cat) service. The rooms of course are on the smaller side (as most Japanese hotels), but are very comfortable with some surprising features. And the location is perfect for any visitor. It is literally a 2-3min walk to Tokyo Central station, which has local train lines as well as bullet train services. There is also a hotel across the street (next to the train station), which run regular shuttle bus services to airports. We were lucky enough to travel during Cherry Blossom season, and were able to take part in a street party/festival, which was only a block away from the hotel. They closed some of the streets for people to sit under the cherry blossom trees to eat, drink and spend time with the families and friends. The hotel definitely made our last days in the country more comfortable and enjoyable.",5,2016/12/10
4,REDACTED,en,4741,"Forus semi-double room. Surprised that there was quite a lot of room for a Tokyo hotel. Bed would be big enough for two. Window looks out to the side of hotel - there is a building a few feet away so not much of a view or natural light (I think this is why the forus room was cheaper its designed mainly for sleep). Lack of a view or much natural light didn't bother me at all but might be an issue for some if staying for longer. Bed great, location fabulous - so close to Tokyo station and hence quick to get anywhere in Tokyo. Lots of restaurants nearby, I found Tokyo station area quiter than Shinjuku, Ginza or Shibuya so preferred it. Shower was great. Strongly recommend.",4,2016/12/04

While you might get the feeling that it seems more like a dorm room than a hotel room if you are used to American rooms, it is incredible well appointed, with amenities that you might expect at a 5 star hotel. The hotel is right near the train station and walking distance to the gardens. You might not have the greatest view, but this is probably the best value you will find in Tokyo.",5,2016/11/28

4,REDACTED,en,4748,"our first Tokyo stop so this hotel was in a great location just across the street from the Tokyo station.
Our room was small but the space was used very well. Bathroom excellent with the usual crazy Japanese toilet.
We had a no view room - and yes true to the description there was absolutely no view! Well to be fair there was a view but it was of a brick wall which was about 2 feet away from the window!! Made it very dark and impossible to know what time of day or night it was, or what the weather was.
However it did keep the price down and there is a lounge area that affords guests a view if that is required.
If you are spending your time out and about then the view doesn't really matter.
There is a sound and light system by the bed that sends you off to sleep and allows a natural wake up with an automatically adjust light.
There are lots of good transport links from the Tokyo station opposite.
This hotel offers good value for money (though I preferred Matsui Garden Premier I would stay here again if needed).",4,2016/11/20

The hotel is very well kept and all the amenities are fantastic. They even provide a Japanese robe to sleep in! 

We had lunch in the restaurant on the lobby floor 15 and it was also very good!

However you have to be careful when booking your room here online.

Double does not mean double as it does in most places - it's actually semi double which is more like a single room with double occupancy so will be very very small and two adults cannot manage easily.

I have still awarded 5 stars because the staff handled the situation very professionally and in the end after some conversation gave us a twin room which was much more appropriate. 

Well done Ryumeikan pictures are attached.",5,2016/11/19

4,REDACTED,en,4752,Stayed here 2 nights prior to flying out of Narita Airport. Located less than 5 minutes from Tokyo Station. Hotel front desk was located on one of the top floors by the hotel restaurant. Hotel staff spoke English well enough for me to be understood with no problems. Room was clean and beds were quality like most Tokyo hotels at this price point. 24 hour Convenience store located right by the ground floor entrance. Staff provided excellent customer service. Ordered an additional suitcase from Amazon and the staff brought it directly to my room. Would stay here again. Had plenty of restaurants nearby. Proximity to Tokyo Station means exploring the rest of the city from this hotel is no problem.,5,2016/11/08
4,REDACTED,en,4753,"Booking a room through this hotel's website is pretty unusual...you don't need to provide your credit card details to secure the room reservation. Pretty amazing! So one can cancel or simply don't turn up last minute (?)

Check-in & out at this hotel is on their topmost 15th floor...means that you will not meet any front desk staff nor bellboys when one goes in and out of this hotel. Can be a good thing or simply a pretty cold impersonal reception each time you step into the hotel. It was Halloween period the 9 nights I had stayed at this hotel, and the hotel seems oblivious to this. Minimal Halloween decor and staff are dressed in their usual work suits. If you are looking for a quiet & no nonsense kind of hotel, this would be it.

The room attendant also has quirks. I always placed my toothbrush & toothpaste in the cup provided in the bathroom. Each time after room cleaning, the items will be placed on their hotel's hand towel instead. They should just leave the items in the cup as this is what the guest wants. 

Much has been said about the location of this hotel...that it is very convenient. Indeed! I took the airport limousine bus from Haneda airport and it stopped at Tekko building which is just opposite to this hotel. The 30mins ride cost ¥930 per pax. Shinkansen aka bullet trains go through Tokyo station (5min walk) and Tokyo subway Nihombashi station (1min walk). Plenty of shopping and restaurants all within short walking distance.",3,2016/11/06

4,REDACTED,en,4756,"This was the first place we stayed upon arriving in Japan. So, we didn't have much to compare it to, other than hotels we've stayed in other countries. But now, having finished our 2 week trip to Japan, I can look back and say that this hotel was excellent. The staff were extremely kind and welcoming. Yet they were also pleasantly unobtrusive (other than the effusive greetings each morning at breakfast). I don't know what their breakfast buffet was like before they changed the menu in August, but we thought it was delicious. I was dealing with a chest cold, and their homemade chicken soup was perfect -- and something I didn't find at any other hotel we stayed at. The selection of Japanese dishes were all delicious -- I can expect that people wanting Western breakfast food would be a bit disappointed by the simple selection. The room was very well equipped; again, the best we encountered while in Japan. For example, they provided wash clothes, which we never encountered elsewhere. And the towels were quite large. We were given fresh bottled water every day -- this was very appreciated since I was trying to stay hydrated while I recovered from my cold. The yukata were very nice, again, the nicest we experienced on our trip. The location by the station was very convenient, but also managed to be a quiet place. Our room was a semi-double, and pretty small -- but we liked the compactness of it. Finally, this hotel had less of a businessman feel about it, with touches that made it feel more accommodating to women travelers, which I appreciated. The bed was very comfortable. I would like to make some adjustments to the Forus sleeping system so that the morning routine started with calmer music and vibration and the overhead lights didn't pop on so brightly, but the falling asleep routine was great.",5,2016/10/29

We stayed for 3 nights, and use subway extensively to go almost everywhere. Very nice amenities, quality of products are great. I really enjoy the FORUS type room which has Sleeping system on the Bed. In short, it's an amazing room!
The staffs are extremely helpful,and are highly recommended. In fact, my wife was panic when realize that she left her cell phone on the bus from Hakone to Tokyo. We notified the staff with the bus information, and the phone detail. They worked on it immediately, and in fifteen minutes, was able to let us know the phone was located, and provided us information/direction to get the phone back.",5,2016/10/24
4,REDACTED,en,4759,"Excellent location. Just down the street from the train station, and subway around the corner. Close to the shopping areas, but these were high end. We easily commuted by subway to other areas in the city. Rooms were spacious and clean. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Very nice amenities provided including sleepwear. No need to carry toiletries in Japan. Quality of products are great. Rooms were amazing. We stayed in the twin room which was very spacious. My other friends stayed in the double which was quite high tech, eg: can connect your phone to the bed which wakes you up in a very stylish fashion. Shower was also very good.",5,2016/10/22

The buffet for breakfast and lunch offers lots of vegetable dishes. Quite unique and worth the detour.",4,2016/10/15
4,REDACTED,en,4761,"This is clearly a business hotel which means small, cramped spaces. That said, it exudes all the best Japan has to offer; helpful staff, perfectly organized rooms, all bath amenities / toiletries, grace and thoughtfulness. Now add - spotlessly and perfectly clean. 

Amazing I know. 

What is missing?

1. A desk or table anywhere in the hotel for two people to sit and look at a map or book... to plan out ones day or work together. 

What else did I wish for?

1. That the desk was on the main floor. I am one of those people who remembers to ask a question when I see the desk as I leave. 

The issue of the reception being out of the way could be solved with a doorman to answer those basic questions such as ; please point me in the direction to______.

I would stay here again in a heartbeat. 

PS- the a/c was without sound. Not even a quiet hum. 

Thank you Hotel R for giving us such a rounder Gil intro to Japan. You set the bar high.",4,2016/10/15
4,REDACTED,en,4762,"We went to this hotel in our last night in Tokyo. It was conveniently located right out the front of Tokyo main station which is a 5 min away to take the bullet trains. This hotel has many delicious restaurants close by and walking distance to ginza. 

We got a comfort room, it was small but it was typical of Japan. It came with lots of amenities such as rice crackers, tea, plugs next to the bed, PJs. The bed was high tech it had vibrations to help sleep and wake up cycle with music and lights.

One of the best hotels we stayed in, in Japan.",5,2016/10/12

Location was within steps of the central Tokyo station with very easy access to Narita (I took the Narita express, but the express bus stops right in front of the hotel). My room (11th floor) had a nice view of the station, was clean, comfortable and fine for the single traveler. The bathroom was well stocked with a large assortment of toiletries (toothbrushes, brushes, etc.). The staff was very friendly and helpful. They spoke very good English and always pleasant. I had a break between my stay and they held my luggage while I took a side trip. Well worth a stay at the Ryumeikan.",5,2016/10/10
4,REDACTED,en,4764,"The hotel’s reception is on the 15th Floor. All the bedrooms are on floors below this one (down to Floor 8).

I had a room with absolutely NO view whatsoever. It backed onto a wall and I could not work out if it was wet, dry, sunny etc etc – it could not have been more of a room without a view. But, my room did have an interesting sleep system. Setting it is easy, soothing music is played in time a vibrating bed with the light reducing to create the setting sun; it was a talking point and more importantly it worked really well!!

Excellent shower and a plethora of toiletries.

The breakfast was totally Japanese! Definitely worth giving a go.

Will definitely stay there again.",5,2016/10/10

We stayed there on the last 3 nights of a 3 week holiday through Japan and it was nice to have a bit of space at the very end compared to the lovely little Ryokans we had stayed in for the previous weeks. Plenty of choice in restaurants nearby if you want to eat near the hotel. Perfect location if you are arriving in Tokyo by shinkansen and don't want to lug suitcases through the subway.",5,2016/10/04
4,REDACTED,en,4767,"Great hotel in central Tokyo with a super room and very friendly and helpful staff who all spoke excellent English. They helped us greatly with sight seeing suggestions around central Tokyo and Ginza, and provided maps with instructions on them. This hotel has an amazing location, only a few minutes walking distance from central Tokyo station, Ginza and the Imperial Palace.

Our room had a brilliant double bed that had an inbuilt entertainment system, as well as a large flat screen TV, and wi-fi. The bed is very firm (as most are in Japan) but we had an excellent sleep and awoke very well refreshed the next day.

Our room also had a Nespresso system which is a great touch for a quick coffee hit before hitting the shopping malls of Ginza. The bathroom was really nice - beautifully clean and a pleasure to shower/bathe in after a hot day in Tokyo. The bathroom was also well stocked with complimentary items such as good quality toothbrushes and hairbrushes etc. Their yukata were also the best of any hotel we stayed in during our trip in Japan - really high quality garments that were a pleasure to relax around the room in.",5,2016/10/03
4,REDACTED,en,4768,"I stayed at 2 different hotels in Tokyo to get to know the various neighborhoods of the world's largest metropolis. RYUMEIKAN definitely beats the luxury Cerulean Tower, the other place I stayed. Though the room was small, it was efficient and clean. The washers were a big plus but there were only two. Staff team was super helpful and went out of their way to assist guests with inquiries. They even emailed me after checkout when they found something I left behind.",5,2016/09/30

4,REDACTED,en,4770,"I stayed in a Forus B Success room. This room had a generous amount of space for a central Tokyo hotel. Double bed, large work desk, comfortable desk chair, and a small sofa. The bed is quite firm. These rooms have no view. There is a window, but it looks straight at an office building 6 feet away. Therefore, you get no natural daylight, nor can you tell what the weather is like when you wake up in the morning. The furniture in my room was showing it's age and the woods dented, and the fabric of the sofa had some stains. Perhaps it is time for a renovation. A very nice feature is that there are complimentary water bottles and rice crackers put in the room every day. They also have a nice booklet about the neighborhood, such as where to eat and shop. 
As others have said, the location across from Tokyo Station is great if you are doing a lot of travel. The Nihombashi Metro station is also only about a 3 minute walk from the front door with access to the Ginza, Tozai, and Asakusa lines. Front desk service was typically Japanese professional and courteous.",4,2016/09/24

It is small but who cares, you are traveling not buying a home : ). Adequately stocked bathroom and vending machines on every floor for water etc 
Hotel is super close to Tokyo station just use the Yaesu North exit and turn left. So many restaurants near the hotel for an affordable meal and Japanese experience. I have been to many places and this hotel was right up there. I also had a great view of the streets below which was an added bonus.",5,2016/09/22
4,REDACTED,en,4772,"The hotel is within 5 minute walk of Tokyo Station. Be sure to use Yaesu Central or Yaesu North exit. Cross the street and turn left. Hotel is well marked on the right just past Family Mart and a British Pub. Hotel itself is nice. It has a Japanese restaurant on site. Yes, the room is small and mine had no view. The room is comfortable and the shower was great. I would stay here again and would highly recommend it. Very close to Imperial Palace grounds. From Tokyo station you can get to anywhere in the city.",5,2016/09/14
4,REDACTED,en,4773,"This is such a well located hotel almost opposite the main Tokyo railway station. The reception s located on 15th floor. We elected for a room with no view and that's what we got - we looked at the wall of the building next door but it didn't matter as it was a reasonably sized room and beautifully appointed. I'm sure a room with a view would have had a very nice outlook over the city. The room was spotless and everything was perfect and where it should be! The room was very quiet. The toiletries provided in the bathroom were even better than those in most of the other lovely hotels we stayed at in Japan and the bathroom had one of the most elaborate shower arrangements I have ever seen. There was a fixed shower rose, a flexible hose outlet and 3 outlets shooting water horizontally onto your body. Then there was a top quality Japanese toilet with all the bells and whistles and water spouts and modesty sounds etc that we were becoming very fond of. 

The reception staff were very friendly and had a tiny amount of English which we appreciated as our Japanese was almost non existent despite our pathetic but heartfelt efforts. 

Apart from being very elegant it is close to a vast number of restaurants, Family Mart and department stores to buy food to take back to the room if you wanted to. We heartily recommend this hotel.",5,2016/09/13
4,REDACTED,en,4774,"We booked 2 'double' rooms which were sold as double on the travel website but were actually very small. The tub was 3/4 size so not sure how a 6 foot adult would fit, or rather just sit. The room is cluttered with so many amenities it left very little counter space. There was no closet, just 3 hangers on the wall. They supplied nice Japanese kimono style robes and slippers. All in all, you are paying to be close to tokyo station. The restaurant dinner was excellent and priced at London prices.",4,2016/09/12
4,REDACTED,en,4775,"Little gem near Tokyo Station.

We were looking for a hotel near Tokyo Station, close to the Imperial Palace and the Ginza. Many hotels in this area were averaging $500-700/night. Using Trip Advisor we found the Ryumeikan Hotel, an affordable little gem one street over from the Tokyo Station. It was in our price range ($200-300). I saw that it received great reviews but thought it would be a basic hotel. Was I ever pleasantly surprised! It was top notch, upscale. Excellent Japanese customer service at check-in (15th floor). Our room was compact and perfectly laid out, well-appointed with robes, slippers, bathroom amenities, complimentary snacks, teas, and a Nespresso coffee maker which is a personal favorite. Complimentary water bottles in the fridge. Bathroom was spa-like with glass walk-in shower with body sprayers and rainwater head in addition to a standard shower head. Wonderfully hot, high volume showers- excellent! Great shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. Vending machine down the hall with inexpensive drinks of every kind, and clothes washer and dryer. You will find you have everything you need at this hotel. It is an easy walk to the Ginza, Imperial Palace, and Tokyo Station. Japanese restaurant on the 15th floor (we didn't try), good Victorian English pub next door, and plenty of food options at the Tokyo Station and vicinity. Lots of shopping opportunities nearby include the Maranouchi Shopping mall, Tokyo Station, and Ginza shopping district.

Tip: To find the hotel from Tokyo Station, follow the signs for the North side Nihonbashi exit, go right on the main street Etai-dori, walk one street over. After crossing the street the hotel is the second building in to the right. Tip: Look up at the top of the buildings to see the giant RYUMEIKAN HOTEL sign, lit up in neon letters at night. Enter the building, take a left to the elevators, lobby is on the 15th floor. Our room said no view so I was expecting a widowless room, but ours did have a widow with natural light looking out at the building next door.

The Ryumeikan Hotel was a pleasant surprise and a perfect stay. We were very happy with our choice. Highly recommend.",4,2016/09/12
4,REDACTED,en,4776,"Hotel Ryumeikan was perfect for the price. Rooms are quite small (as is expected in Japan), however the beds are very comfortable.

4,REDACTED,en,4777,"I stayed here for one night with my husband and toddler. The room was quite small but big enough fit a cot (make sure you speak to them if you need a cot; some of the rooms aren't big enough for cots and they had to change our room type to accommodate).

The room was extremely clean and fresh and the bathroom was lovely. The restaurant was OK but not great by Tokyo's exceedingly high standards. The restaurant made a mistake with our order but we did receive a refund.

The location is quite good although the heart of Ginza is about a 15 minute walk away. There is a Family Mart right next to the hotel that accepts foreign cards.

The staff members we interacted with were extremely kind and helpful. They had a fantastic map showing how to quickly and cheaply get to Narita airport by bus; there is a bus stop 1 minute away from the hotel with airport buses every 20 minutes.

All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel for a short stay in Tokyo as it is quite lovely and very reasonably priced.",4,2016/09/08

4,REDACTED,en,4779,"After a bell to bell day of touring Tokyo with our wonderful Guide Hidye and literally feeling like my feet were going to fall off, I was overjoyed to walk into such a spacious and lovely room with the most comfortable beds and soft linens. We had taken the 6 am Shinkansen from Kyoto because my 11 year old had to go to Tokyo and see the Harajuku District and drink in all that Tokyo could give us over the course of 30 hours! 

Our Room had two huge beds with traditional Kimono and slippers laid out on each bed. There were huge floor to ceiling Windows and off to the left was a view of the gigantic neon billboards that we all think of when we think of Tokyo! There was a huge reclining chair near the window to kick back on and Once I crawled into bed, fell into deep quiet slumber for one of my best nights of sleep in the last year! 

The front desk staff was excellent, fluent in English and took all our luggage while we left for the whole day and evening and then had everything waiting in our room for us upon our return. Another bonus was the close proximity to the train station..we literally walked out of our hotel and were inside the station within 10 minutes the next morning while passing all the salary men and women on there way to work! 

I highly recommend this solid 4 star hotel and would stay there again without hesitation!",5,2016/09/02

No need to go anywhere, best noodles and street food. 
Overall a great place to stay.",5,2016/08/31
4,REDACTED,en,4781,"We booked an economy double room for 2 nights. The room was small but well appointed. I loved the amenities and the bathroom products. The pajamas and robes were a treat. The shower was amazing. I wanted to take everything out of that room with me except for the beds and pillows... Bed was too hard for us, and the pillows a bit uncomfortable. But the service was impeccable. They left us a nice gift for our anniversary and were quite accommodating during our stay. The location (near Tokyo and Nihombashi metro stations) was very convenient. We enjoyed our stay!",5,2016/08/29
4,REDACTED,en,4782,"Stayed here when I was visiting Tokyo during the Japanese New Year. I booked this hotel very last minute, was very luck that a friend of mine who frequently stays in this hotel got me in touch with the hotel directly and I was able to reserve a single room for three nights in one of the busiest time of the year. Although it's slightly expensive, I'm okay with that for a last minute, high season booking.

The hotel (reservation team I guess) responded to my emails quickly and I'm very happy with my experience with the staff at this hotel. As other reviews mentioned, the location is great. A few minutes away from Tokyo station which connects to all parts of Tokyo. It's very convenient if you're traveling out of the city as well, whether it's a day trip or your next destination. There's a airport bus station at the doorstep of the hotel which connects to one of the airports (I've forgotten which). There are many restaurants in and around Tokyo station. Not sure about the restaurant in the hotel but according to my friend their food is not bad. A number of large department stores are also within walking distance.

The room is in decent size for a single room (bare in mind that Japanese hotel rooms in general are smaller than hotel rooms in other location). It has everything you'll need in it. Clean and tidy with comfortable (double) beds. I was expecting to hear traffic noise as the hotel is on a major road but I can confirm it's very quiet in the room with the double-glazed windows.

Happy customer and will recommend.",4,2016/08/25

4,REDACTED,en,4784,I stayed for 3 nights with my wife and daughter. We chose this hotel to experience traditional Japanese culture. The futon accommodations illustrate that the Japanese are a tougher people than Americans. :) Comfortable stay. Good location. Pretty convenient to the subway and tourist areas downtown. We found a super ramen place a couple blocks Northwest one night when it rained and we didn't want to venture too far out. Breakfast was uninteresting. I had hoped for something with more local flavor. We skipped it the last day. I would recommend for a local experience at a very affordable rate.,4,2016/08/09
4,REDACTED,en,4785,"This hotel is wonderful. Perfectly central location (literally right across tokyo station - 5 mins walk max), great service and awesome amenities in the room.

My boyfriend and I came to the hotel a day before our check-in to store our bags. By the time we came again to check-in the next day, bags are placed in our room already.

Room is more spacious than standard Japanese hotel rooms, plenty of space to have both our suitcases open. There's a Nespresso machine in the room which is great for morning coffee. There's also a unique wake-up system which is interesting (wakes you up by slowly turning on all lights automatically and soothing music with vibration in bed). Nice small touches.

Overall an excellent experience. Will recommend to people who needa stay near the JR station without paying sky-high price.",5,2016/08/03

Two bottles of water and four coffee k-cups per day per person are in the room and replenished as needed. Small packets of snacks also. Helpful staff with good English. Gave good directions to catch trains and subways, location of 7-11 and stores. Many restaurants and shops nearby and in the station.
Hotel is about a five minute walk across the street from Tokyo Station. Leave Tokyo Station by the Yaesu North Exit and cross the street.

4,REDACTED,en,4791,"Tokyo was the second and last stop of our family holiday in Japan. I had never heard of this hotel though Tokyo is a familiar city. It was a three-generation family trip but hotel rooms in Tokyo are typically small. So i googled ""hotels good for family"" and Hotel Ryumeikan was in the list. The hotel claimed to have rooms that are bigger than average. It is true. The room we booked has 3 proper super single beds, and still has room for our luggage and my dad's wheelchair (offered for use in the hotel by the hotel).
The hotel was very responsive to my requests. I had asked to be allocated room near lift lobby and room with shower space in my booking. The hotel responded the next day. The rooms are all fitted with bath tub so the hotel offered a stool and slippery mat in the bath tub. They were very fast in their responses to my follow-up emails too. And we got a room which is just next to the lift lobby.
Amenities in the room were excellent - full range of toiletries, including facial wash for ladies. Each day, each guest received 4 Nespresso capsules and 2 bottles of mineral water (I'm sure the hotel would gladly provide more if it's required); there were free titbits too.
And of course, being so near Tokyo Station, there are many eateries nearby. Daimaru and Takashimaya are nearby too.

4,REDACTED,en,4794,"I had to travel for business with a Shinkansen bullet train 4 times, going to west and north from Tokyo station in one week ( plus some domestic Tokyo subway travel). And I had to find a mid range hotel.

Only a few hotels fit in with this criteria around Tokyo station (though there are many if you compromise the convenience of location)

This hotel is very close to the Shinkansen exit of Tokyo station (North exit). It took only 4 min from the hotel reception to the Shinkansen platform in the station. Also there is a subway station for a domestic train travel within 4 min walk if you want to avoid crowd in the huge and busy Tokyo station. 

The room is ok and the service is good. Another good point of this hotel is a Japanese breakfast buffet. Though the restaurant is not large and there are not many selections of dish, the quality of each dish is high. You can tell all dishes are cooked freshly by good chefs. There is also a convenience store right next to this hotel for any needs.

Overall, this hotel is great for busy business travelers who likes the convenience and practicality.",4,2016/06/23

The Forus A was quite small but well appointed, with an excellent shower. The staff made switching rooms easy, and we particularly enjoyed the roomier Corner Deluxe Twin where we were able to spread out and sit somewhere other than on the bed. All employees we dealt with were friendly and helpful, and spoke English. They gave us maps of restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the hotel which we took advantage of, made dinner reservations for us at a high end sushi restaurant in the Ginza area and overall were extremely pleasant and accommodating.

As noted by many other reviewers, you can't beat the location of the hotel if you're like us and want to take trains and subways to explore both in and outside of Tokyo. I was afraid the neighborhood was going to be too businesslike for a leisure vacation, but there were plenty of bars and restaurants nearby, and exploring the little alleyways in the vicinity was lots of fun.

The basics were all in place, but things like the bed that gently wakes you with lights and soft music, the in built sound system, the nespresso machine, facilities available (like foot massagers) to the unique little customisable screen (and the best shower we had in Japan).

4,REDACTED,en,4804,"Hotel Ryumeikan Tokyo was a comfortable and affordable hotel given its location and the Christmas/New Year period that we travelled in. 

The hotel service was brief as there is no interaction with reception on a daily basis due to its positioning on a high-floor of the hotel, however we found all amenities to be well looked after by the housekeeping staff and had no other issue or need to call reception. 

The location is desirable, meanwhile it did get rather cold travelling to and from the station exists, as expected in January. The rooms are basic however provide all the necessities that you require, and also have the automated Japanese toilets which is always a plus for visitors. 

I would recommend this hotel for those looking for a central base, that is not overpriced, within a respectable walking distance from transport and key destinations including Tokyo Station, Ginza district and the fish markets (while they remain at their current location)
There are significant nearby amenities including starbucks, food court (across the street under Tokyo Station) and department stores. Further towards Ginza, the world is your oyster! 

Travelling to the hotel from the airport, I would advise getting on 1000yen shuttle bus that takes you directly to tokyo station rather than the usual airport limousine (because they stop at the same stop and the shuttle bus is cheaper for the same service)

Travelling anywhere internally, I would recommend using Tokyo Station, or the surrounding stations, as required. 

It is a beautiful location for the Christmas and New Years period as Tokyo Station, Ginza and surrounding streets are lit up with lights and it is rather scenic.",5,2016/06/06
4,REDACTED,en,4805,"Just a 5 minute walk from Tokyo train station, Ryumeikan hotel provides small, clean, comfortable rooms at a reasonable price, plus breakfast and restaurant facilities. Service is unnoticeable unless required, with very quick check-in and check-out possibly your only interactions with the staff. Location is not the most exciting, but it's very well connected and extremely practical if you're reaching your next destination by train out of Tokyo station.",4,2016/06/04
4,REDACTED,en,4806,"The location is ideal- short walking distance from JR & metro lines, the Tokyo station has useful amenities, convenience store is just next door. The nearby streets have some nice eateries too. A bonus is that the airport bus transfer is nearby & I will recommend it (rather than lugging your luggage through though the subways).The hotel itself is small & it's a place to stay & that's it; it does have one washing machine for laundry & that's useful. The staff are very friendly & am impressed by them.
The room: typical Japanese hotels, tiny but it's clean & functional; good toiletries.
The price is not cheap; so you're paying for ease of transport & a clean room.",4,2016/06/02

Comfortable king size bed, complimentary Nespresso coffee bar,snacks and bottled water. Bathroom has separate rooms with soaking tub and Toto toilet. Fully array of toiletries included for patrons. Highly recommended. Got great deal through Trip Advisor link to Agoda.",5,2016/05/30
4,REDACTED,en,4808,"Wanted to stay in Ginza and booked this hotel based on good Tripadvisor reviews. Booked a deluxe twin (corner) room which was large with comfy beds (Japanese double beds can be small so twin beds a good idea if you need space!) Good hotel in great location - 5 min walk (south west) to Tokyo station and 5 mins (east) to Nihombashi station. Tokyo station has tons of eating options and Daimaru dept store has fab restaurants on top floor. Service in the hotel was excellent and we had a lovely meal in the restaurant, the day we arrived. The only downside was that there is no bar (or room service) but there's a nice basement bar called Ocean Bar, a few doors down which is nice for a pre dinner drink. Lovely bar tenders, spoke good English and were very charming.",5,2016/05/27

No window in the room, and a pointless dining-space with a dark exterior court.

The carpet in the hallway smells, as well in the rooms.
Renovation is urgent!

Considering the location and quality of service and room, I found the hotel a great bargain!

The room was a tiny but very modern had everything we needed for my small family.

Hotel staff spoke English and helped me mail my luggage to our hotel in Osaka. Room amenities were far better than Western hotels. There were slippers free to take home; aside from the shampoo & conditioner they had a razor, sewing kit, cotton pads, headband, toothbrush. They even gave my kids a little welcoming gift. On my son's birthday they gave him a little pouch with some Japanese goodies. Loved how they had free bottled water in the room and coffee. They had a coin operated a washer (detergent included) and dryer on certain floors. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016/05/09

4,REDACTED,en,4821,"If you're going to be hanging around the Tokyo train station area in Chuo, I can't recommend a better place to stay for the value. We stayed in the Japanese Junior Suite (A) with 4 adults and thought it was more than adequate. The suite includes two double-size beds in one section, with two floor futon mattresses in another room, separated by a sliding door. All items in the room refrigerator were complimentary, the bathroom was well appointed with toiletries and included the most high-tech toilet we found while staying in Japan. The rooms are a bit small, but in a city of 13.5 million, don't expect to find spacious rooms anywhere! The front desk was very accommodating to reserving us a cab for 2AM to go to Tsukiji, as well as keeping our luggage until the mid-afternoon while we explored the city the day we checked out. Overall, great place to stay if you're looking to stay near the Tokyo train station (10-minute walk, if that).",4,2016/04/30

4,REDACTED,en,4823,"This hotel is super nice and close to the Tokyo station if you are catching Shinkansen or Narrita Express. We came back to Tokyo on the Shinkansen from Kyoto and were leaving the next day on the Narrieta Express, so this hotel worked great. 

Exit the station from the Yaesu North exit (not Yaesu North Central), cross the street right in front of you, then go left on that street. You'll come to the hotel building to your right. Go through the first doors and then immediately to your left take the elevator to reception on 15. Google maps may show the hotel about a block behind where the entrance is, but just stay on that street in front of you when you exit the station. 

This hotel had the largest rooms I experienced in Japan. It was quiet and comfortable. 

We had brunch at Sarabeth's near the train station, then walked to the Imperial Palace Gardens in the morning before catching the train to the airport.",4,2016/04/23
4,REDACTED,en,4824,I stayed at this hotel for one night as a solo traveller. The main reason I chose this hotel was because there was an airport shuttle bus right outside the hotel. Room was very comfortable and clean even though it was small. I enjoyed the little details such as origami paper and a postcard which the hotel will send for free. I was pleasantly surprised to be told breakfast is available until 14:00. Selection was very good and the food was very tasty. Will definitely stay here again if I'm travelling alone.,4,2016/04/21

First, need to take the elevator to the top floor lobby. Check in was fast. Rooms are very clean and modern. Feel good in room totally no weird or smoke smell. Bed is comfortable. Breakfast is catered more towards local taste. Good enough for foreigner albeit a bit expensive. Being a regular, I opt for breakfast outside the hotel. Hotel about 5 minutes walk from tokyo station and if it is the Sakura season, you will walk pass the Sakura street. There is a limousine stop outside the hotel to go to narita airport. Will definitely stay here when they have promotion.",5,2016/04/20

4,REDACTED,en,4827,"Our stay at Hotel Ryumeikan was great! The room size was more than enough to spend a couple of nights, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was amazing. Everything was SUPER clean and organized! Definitely recommend it!

The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The possibility to store our luggage before check in and after check out was a very nice bonus. Also, when we went back to the hotel to check in, our luggage was already in our room, saving us the trouble to take it ourselves. Again, a very nice plus!

The room amenities were superb and all complimentary! For example: coffee machine with coffee capsules, tea, snacks, water, toiletry (which were of GREAT quality), slippers, sleeping gowns, kimonos! Also, even though the room was not super spacious (as expected from any property in Japan), every detail of it was so well planned that you had the feeling it was way bigger than it actually was. We didn’t feel cramped at all!

Located right next to the Tokyo Station, it takes just a 5-10 minute walk to reach the hotel (depending on your pace). 

Extra tip: We used the JR Pass and the Yamanote line to move around the city. However, the JR train stations weren’t that close to all tourist places, like the Fish Market. I believe the subway is a better choice if you can expend some extra cash to buy the passes!

Right near station to go anywhere, restaurants in the street behind and the park which is beautiful and should be seen about a 8 minute relaxing walk. Lots and lots of amenities, it was great. Bed is comfortable, room is small but we upgraded in size a bit. It was fine for what we needed even for a few days - didn't feel cramped really and the colours were nice. View was of a brick wall though lol! Would recommend if you don't want to spend too much and need to go to the station to get around.",4,2016/04/18

We spent time wondering in the station until we notice that there was no Yaesu North Exit until you went out from the station.

Next to the hotel was family mart and nice local Ramen place which always opened day and night (it opened very early in the morning and last until very late at night)

No room service. dinner after 21:00 is impossible and you have to find some food outside. No problem to find a place if you really want to go out.

I arrived at 11:00 from the airport and no room was available yet. Unless I took an upgrade and paid extra. And so I did.
No mini bar but a Nespresso coffee device and water cooker.

They provided pajamas and slippers that I liked too. There's a nice lighting system on the bed headboard and reading lights. There isn't any English speaking tv stations so you might want to bring your own entertainment or music. Tokyo Station is a three minute walk away. There's a lot of restaurants in the area and in Tokyo Station. This was a fantastic location for me. I'd stay here again and I'll recommend it to friends.,4,2016/04/04

The location is on walking distance from the drop off and get on the airport limousine bus from both Narita and Haneda airport. I prefer the airport limousine because no hassle for a big luggage like mine to get on and off the bus. The distance is shorter, if we use train.

I stayed in a twin superior room, which was cosy, but not cramped.

The hotel room had a very upmarket feel, with very comfy bedding. The counter staff understand English and are very helpful and professional. 

A quick and easy breakfast option (cereal/toast) would be nice. There is a convenience store next door to the hotel, which is handy. They do offer a traditional Japanese breakfast - if you have fussy kids, this is probably not a great idea.

Great hotel for business, or for a quick stop over. It wouldn't be great with kids if it was a longer stay (but that's ok, it is a business hotel!).

4,REDACTED,en,4844,"We chose this hotel for our last week around Tokyo (before and after going to Disney). We stayed a total of three nights. We chose it because of its location (just a short walk from the Tokyo station, where we arrived with the Shinkansen, we went to Disney from there, and we rode the Narita Express from there as well). You also have a combini next door, which is quite nice to buy some snacks in the morning.
The first night was a bit suffocating. We had a really small room (it was the Standard Double Room) that faced a wall that was quite close (it seemed like it was 10 meters away tops, and the room was far from the sidewalk), therefore it was also extremely dark. The bed was tiny and had this weird sound and vibration system to wake you up (we didn't find a way to turn the alarm off). It did have a Nespresso machine, which was quite nice. We got used to the room and were a bit better the following and last night (during which we were in the Economy Double Room; it was a bit smaller, but at least it had a bit more of natural light).

When dealing with the front desk staff, it felt as if they were doing you a favor whenever you talked to them (it was the only hotel in Japan I felt this way). They did store our luggage while we were away, but they seemed quite bothered when we got there on the last day and left the luggage we took to Disney with us and didn't want to carry around the city.",2,2016/03/03

Come out of Tokyo station- Yaesu north exit , turn left and cross the road and it's just along about 500 meters. Really quiet, lovely staff and great bathrooms. rooms are not huge but as you want to be out and about it's for sleeping and changing. Immaculately clean well designed. We stayed 2 nights before going skiing and two nights after. Staff couldn't be more helpful. Hairdryer, dressing gown and kimono, all the toiletries you could need, and some you couldn't imagine needing! 
We ate our breakfast for 390 yen at a cafe just along from the hotel. ( breakfast at the hotel was 2,500 yen) Pronto il bar just out the hotel turn left then turn left at the golf shop. Diagonally opposite Starbucks. Boiled egg, salad,toast and tea or coffee.

We also ate at a fantastic fun place just outside the hotel turn left and straight left again. Its a small building sitting on it's own. what fantastic staff and great atmosphere! don't go unless you like meat. very popular with the local city workers. kebabs of scrumptious meat ( which melted in the mouth) including various entrails are cooked in front of you ( you could have a chicken kebab) and everyone gets cheered when they arrive or order another beer.Theatrics galore.

The room was small but clean and well-appointed, with nice little amenities (complimentary water in the fridge, robes for guests, etc). The bathroom was much larger than I had expected. This is a great bang-for-your-buck hotel in a superb location.",5,2016/02/24
4,REDACTED,en,4848,"My wife and I travelled to Tokyo in February 2016 on holidays. The three nights that we spent in Tokyo, we stayed at the Ryumeikan Tokyo Hotel and the experience from beginning to end has been very pleasant. 

After making the booking online, we got in contact with the hotel via email and asked them to please ensure that our room was non-smoking and away from smoking floors. The hotel responded within 2 hours indicating that our request was going to be granted. 

The first thing you notice when you reach the hotel is that the location is top. You are just a couple of minutes walking from Tokyo main train station (direct trains from Narita and Haneda Airports), Nihombashi subway, loads of restaurants to choose from and main attractions such as the Imperial Palace, Tsukiji fish market or the neighbourhoods of Shibuya and Akihabara are “around the corner”. On the hotel’s door step there is a nice restaurant, a couple of coffee shops and a 24/7 convenient store where you can grab a sandwich in the night if you are too tired and don’t fancy to dine in a restaurant. 

Reception is in the top (15th) floor. Upon arrival the staff is very pleasant, polite, and they speak English. The weather was cold, so receiving warm wet little towels to clean your hands and face was very welcoming and nice gesture from them. 

We booked one of the smallest versions of the possible configurations offered by the hotel; our room was located on the 14th floor. The room do not have wardrobe, but there is space enough in front of the the bed or in the room’s corridor to store your baggage (note that we carried two massive cases and handluggage!), so for us this was not an issue. The bathroom is also small, but practical and absolutely spotless. There is a little basket with loads of complimentary stuff such as shaving foam, aftershave lotions, bath salts, comb, brushes, toothbrush, toothpaste, headbands, cotton buds… and if you are missing something, the reception staff brings it to your room in no time. The bath is big enough and the flow of water in the shower is great, particularly after a long day walking around the city.

The bed was of a decent size keeping in consideration Japanese’s bed standards. I had read reviews of hotels where the beds were really tiny. This is not the case in this hotel, where the two of us slept comfortably without bothering each other. Something I really liked was that the hotel provides a typical Japanese kimono/pyjama for you to use. It’s a nice gesture and gets you into their culture a bit; we found it fun to get them on. 

The room temperature can be regulated with a very easy to use thermostat located on the wall. I had read reviews of American tourists who found the air conditioned not good enough in Japanese hotels. We visited in winter, so I cannot comment on air conditioning as we made use of the heating; it worked fantastically leaving our room warm and lovely. 

The TV choice is not great, but you can purchase a TV card for films and stuff on demand. In the floor’s corridor there was also a self-service drinks dispenser and ice. Here is where you can also buy the TV on demand cards. The prices of the drinks are the same as the convenient store or the vending machines on the street, so it is good to see that the hotel do not take advantage of the service increasing the prices of the drinks. 

The room has safe to store your money, jewellery and documentation if needed. It also has a small fridge although I can’t remember if it had any drinks in it. There is also a kettle and a choice of complimentary teas and coffee. Every day they also put a couple of little bags of Japanese snacks that we found nice to eat during midday. 

Although we stayed in the tallest of the possible floors, the view wasn’t anything special. Again, this did not bother us at all, as we used the hotel simply to sleep and rest, and we spent all the time in the city out and about. 

WIFI is available and for free. Its speed and signal strength is well above standard. We did not stream music or films, but we were using chatting apps to catch up with friends and family and it worked absolutely fine. We also sent a few photos and checked email with no hassle at all. 

We can’t comment on the breakfast as we didn’t combine our room reservation with it. Instead we had breakfast on a Starbucks located literally 200 meters far from the hotel’s door. However the breakfast area on the 15th floor (next to the reception) looks fine. 

Check-out is at 11 am. The hotel asks you to return the card/keys of your room or you will be charged for them. Our flight out of Tokyo wasn’t until 23:00hrs so we asked the reception staff to look after our baggage, which they did for free and without any hassle, problem or hesitation (we did read some reviews of other hotels being funny about this, or even charging for leaving the baggage in reception, hence why we think is worth mentioning).

Overall, a very pleasant and relaxing stay in a top hotel with a very reasonable rate per night.",5,2016/02/23
4,REDACTED,en,4849,"Perfect Location to Tokyo Central Station. (take yaesu central exit, cross the road, turn left and walk 5 mins). This hotel set the standards throughout our travels. Only wish it was our last stop and not our first. Only issue was the room was very hot. This was resolved by opening the window. Would recommend to family and friends.",5,2016/02/20
4,REDACTED,en,4850,"Excellent combination of price and location, just five minutes walk to JR Tokyo Central Station and priced well for the area. Visited several times over the years and never disappoints, always clean with polite staff. Rooms vary in size but not bad for Tokyo, especially for the single business traveler. Go left when you exit hotel and you will see a 24/7 style shop to get water, snacks and other provisions, then keep walking and you will see a Starbucks on a left side street, keep walking 10 minutes more and you enter the Ginza district which has fantastic shopping and several food options, usually inside the upscale department stores.",5,2016/02/20
4,REDACTED,en,4851,"Hotel is very near to Tokyo station and subway (Nihonbashi) 
Walking distance to Takashimaya and Daimaru. 

Hotel staff are helpful, friendly and reply quickly via email.

What I hate is the check out time. 11am. If not 2500¥ will be imposed after some allowance.
And they are not flexible in their early check in policy. You are required to book one additional day (the day before) if u are arriving early morning in Tokyo!!! 



",4,2016/02/16
4,REDACTED,en,4852,"The location of this hotel is just about perfect, just a few steps away from the main Tokyo station, the station has lots of shopping and great restaurants. There is also tons of eating and convenience stores nearby. The check in lobby is on the 15th floor, all of the staff that we interacted with were helpful and pleasant. My wife and I booked a semi double room that proved to be a bit small for the 2 of us, I know most hotels in Japan are small in comparison to hotels in the US (home for us), but this room was exceptionally small. The room was very clean and stocked with complementary water (2 bottles a day). The room did include a safe and frige. There was no closet or dresser so you will be literally living out of your suit case. There was a post with a few hangers for your coats. The room also has a TV with a good number of channels for you watch, you also have free in room Wifi.",4,2016/02/15
4,REDACTED,en,4853,"My son and I stayed here for a night and really enjoyed our stay. We had a nice view from our 13th floor room. The hotel is in a good neighborhood and located just across Tokyo Station. Next to the hotel is a small grocery store, convenient for buying snacks and drinks.",4,2016/02/12
4,REDACTED,en,4854,"Stayed in semi-double. Small like most Tokyo station hotels but it was all good and there was sufficient space to open 2 suitcases. Had all toiletries like face wash and moisturiser, toothbrush, comb, comfy bedroom slippers and in room safe etc

Its a 10 min (tops) slow walk with suitcase from Tokyo station. Head towards the Daimaru (Yaesu North ) exit. Cross the road turn left and walk past the Honma golf shop and keep going till you see the hotel entrance. Its right next to a pub. Lots of ramen shops about. 

The reception and lobby on 15th floor has nice sofas and great views towards Tokyo station, and complimentary water and tea.
Reception staff were cheerful and helpful. Recommended a small great sushi restaurant Numase tucked in a corner inside Tokyo station, ground level past Daimaru. 


",5,2016/02/12
4,REDACTED,en,4855,"This is a building with a hotel in the 8-15th floors. Located next to Tokyo Station. Stayed in a triple room which had sufficient room. Bathroom with high tech toilet or washlet, i.e. heated with water sprays. The shower was strong, but the temperature changes now and again, it keeps you alert and probable not want to stay there too long. Nespresso with daily refills were great, especially since there was no room service. There is a mini fridge so you can stock up on things. The bed is very very firm! Feels like sleeping on the floor or tatami mat. There are two restaurants in the building, a 24 hour family mart and cafe next door. Two bus services from the airport to this building, one is the Airport Limousine Bus and the second is Keisei highway bus. Both have their own bus stops. The Keisei stops next to the building entrance. The ALB, which is commonly reported, stops 5-10 minutes South. It is a longer walk, across 10 side streets! Yes, I counted. Staff were nice and spoke good English. The room was clean and all switches worked.",4,2016/02/12
4,REDACTED,en,4856,Very impressed with this hotel. Just few minutes walk from shin Tokyo station. Staff are very friendly. Room is so high tech with music to be played before you sleep and to wake you up. Shower room is squeeqy cleen. It took me few minutes to understand many buttons to operate a toilet. Many thanks to reception team. I extended my stay for another night but staff mistakenly charge me for lower rate. Yet i received a note in my room from Ms Yano apologising for this error and not even asking for for additional rate. I felt uncomfortable and pity this lady so i went to reception counter to pay for this difference. Staff insist that it was their mistake and they adamantly dont want to accept for this payment even after several attempts. This is trully Japanese hospitality and will not hesitate to recommend it to my friends. Kinsly send my regards to Ms Yono.,5,2016/02/09
4,REDACTED,en,4857,The hotel is in a great location which only minutes walking distance to Tokyo Station and subway station around the corner. The shuttle bus to Narita airport is also around the corner of the hotel. The service is excellent. The room is nice. Small but quite. The breakfast is excellent.,5,2016/02/08
4,REDACTED,en,4858,"Great hotel very close to Tokyo station. My room was small but high quality. Good bed. Staff knows English and very helpful. 24hour store very close. Good coffee shop close, open 6:45.
I would recommend if you need to be close to Tokyo station.",5,2016/02/03
4,REDACTED,en,4859,"Superb location: only 10 min walk via underpass to Tokyo Station and all its adjoining malls and facilities (so you would be spoilt for choice in terms of shopping and eating), and of course, from there you can pretty much be anyway in Tokyo via metro, JR, shinkansen etc. Of note also is the bus stop for the bus to Narita, right at its doorstep. I highly recommend going around Tokyo station's huge network of underground malls. Getting lost in them trying to find a good ramen is part of the fun.

We stayed for 4 nights over new year and it was a crazy price. It didn't even include breakfast so we didnt get to try their dining options. 24-hour convenience store right on the ground floor so you don't even need to put on real shoes. Concierge service was just adequate (polite but not exceptionally friendly). There are coin laundry/dryer machines on some floors if you need them. 

Room was tiny, even by Tokyo standards, and you would be knocking into each other many times. Bed was comfy though s we had a good rest each night. Overall, we had a reasonably good stay here. It's a good hotel, but really most of what you pay for is not the hotel but the incredible location.",4,2016/01/31
4,REDACTED,en,4860,The location is convenient with minute walking distance to subway. Round the corner is the shuttle bus stop heading to Narita airport. And the beautiful Tokyo Station in 5 minutes walking distance. The staffs are nice. The room is space.,5,2016/01/27
4,REDACTED,en,4861,Stayed here in 2011 and again last weekend. It still feels and looks brand new. Typical Japanese size and the bathroom well appointed. Great price for where it is located. Opposite Tokyo Station!!!! Didn't eat here went to the station for breakfast and chose from one of the many street restaurants for dinner. Warning most of the station shops are closed on a weekend. Found a western breakfast cafe under the main street southern end.,5,2016/01/26
4,REDACTED,en,4862,"We stayed here for three nights in a twin room. It was a decent size, nice and light and the Nespresso machine was a plus. It was also good value. We moved on to the Tokyo Station Hotel where, for a lot more money, we had a smaller room which looked out onto a wall and had only one drawer to unpack into. 

The other plus of the Ryumeikan is that it is right on the Ginza metro line, which gets you to lots of useful spots without needing to change trains, as well as being very close to Tokyo Station.",5,2016/01/20
4,REDACTED,en,4863,"We arrived later in the evening to Tokyo station from the airport, and after reading the reviews i knew the exist we had to take to leave almost in front of the hotel. 
The hotel is really well located if you are planning to take shinkassen trains, or coming from the airport or if you have a japan rail pass where you can use yamatone line for free. There is nothing much to see around the hotel...
The rooms are very spacious, i booked a superior double which was supposed to have 25 square meters but it seemed much bigger. The bed was very comfortable, the pillows as well. The bathroom was really spacious. The room had complimentary coffee, tea, water. 
Recommended.",4,2016/01/20
4,REDACTED,en,4864,"got hotels deals for double room with good price, went to this hotel because Im going to Tokyo Disneyland and near Tokyo Station Yaesu Exit, staff speak excellent english, and also very nice, I love the bedroom that you can plug in your iPod or phone and they will play your music from your device all over your room, but in my room i don't get any view ( i don't really care about this ) I would like to stay at this hotel again ut hotel always full booked.",5,2016/01/17
4,REDACTED,en,4865,"I stayed at this property for one night with my wife and grown-up daughter.

the hotel was easily accessed from our arrival point JR Tokyo Station.

The check-in staff spoke excellent English and were very helpful.

The room was spacious, clean and comfortable with the amenities beyond the usual (the capsule coffee was very welcome!).

There was no problem strong our bags after check-out - again the staff were very helpful.

I have no hesitation recommending this property.",5,2016/01/14
4,REDACTED,en,4866,"The Ryumeikan has a century-long history, but the current property is modern. 

This is a fine hotel at the upper end of the business-hotel range in Tokyo. It is essentially across the street from the eastern side of Tokyo station and a couple blocks away from Nihonbashi — the zero-milestone for the nation. I found my 14th-storey room comfortable, quiet, and quite suitable for a busy vacation stay. Wi-Fi was fast, the in-room fridge works, and there is plenty of room. The bathroom is an efficient and fully equipped pre-fab. (You will find these in many Japanese hotels, and many people think them an improvement on Western hotel bathrooms.)

The neighborhood is lively and good for eating, especially on a weeknight. But it's business-y more than charming. Local 24-hour activity will appeal to jet-lagged travellers. The hotel is convenient to many city attractions. And, importantly, Tokyo station is a departure point for the Narita Express and most shinkansen lines, and the eastern side is home to multiple malls and two major, upscale department stores. (Reminder to travellers: as in New York, Tokyo's main intercontinental airport, Narita, is about an hour from town. Only such grand cities can still get away with this inconvenience.)

I recommend checking for deals (Tripadvisor will give pointers to the on-line booking agencies with the best rates). As of my trip, Japan is an affordable vacation destination for people from the U.S., UK, or Switzerland, due to favorable currency rates. 

I would stay at this hotel again. While it's not in my favorite Tokyo ward, the incredible convenience makes a swell base while exploring this biggest, most convenient, and perhaps most delicious of the world's conurbations.",4,2016/01/13
4,REDACTED,en,4867,The hotel is a walking distance to the Tokyo station and a few walking distance to the subway station. Staff was excellent and very helpful! The room is very clean and has the coolest gadget you can find. The sound systems coincides with the way you fall asleep and wake up as well as the foot massage.,5,2016/01/13
4,REDACTED,en,4868,"Hotel Ryumeikan is the cheapest option among top 10 hotels on TA. Considering its quality, it probably offers the best price-to-quality ratio. 
1. Location: 10 minutes from Tokyo station and close to two major metro lines. Close to an area with lots of restaurants and shops
2. Transportation to airport: there's a airport shuttle bus stop in front of the hotel. It's easier and cheaper than taking airport express train
3. Room: it's not a big room but it has everything you need and all in excellent condition. 
4. Not far from royal palace, excellent for those who would like to take the popular jogging route around royal palace in the morning. 
I will definitely stay at this hotel for my future trips to Tokyo.",5,2016/01/11
4,REDACTED,en,4869,Central location in Tokyo and hard to beat being a 30 second walk from the bus stop for the airport shuttle bus. It made it really easy to come and go for our short one night stay in Tokyo. Rooms are great and they were able to provide an extra bed for our daughter.,4,2016/01/09
4,REDACTED,en,4870,We love staying at this hotel and it is always our No 1 choice when in Tokyo. We had a double room which is spacious and well set out. We found everything faultless and reliably good since we first began staying here when it was newly opened. Staff are always friendly and very helpful. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great location within walking distance to Tokyo Station.,5,2016/01/07
4,REDACTED,en,4871,"We stayed in this hotel for 7 nights and found it very close to transport. Both the Tokyo train station and the subway are within easy walking distance giving you easy access to the rest of Tokyo. The hotel lobby is located on the 20th floor, there isn't a restaurant at the hotel but there are a lot of eateries close by including ramen street in the Tokyo station and restaurants in the Daimaru department store. There are also several cafes near the hotel for breakfast including one right next door. There is also a mini market selling hot and cold drinks and convenience foods next door too, it has an atm inside that works for foreign cards which is very handy. The hotel supplied a lot of amenities including slippers, dressing gowns, toothbrushes, razors and a pod coffee machine. The staff were very friendly and even helped me book a restaurant for dinner in another part of town even though we were checking out of the hotel that morning. I would definitely stay here again. The convenience of the train station was excellent.",4,2016/01/06
4,REDACTED,en,4872,"Clean and well equipped hotel, near Tokyo station (for JR and subways) and Nihombashi station (for subways). The room is cleaned. Easy to find (find Yaesu exit from Tokyo station, and you are not far from them).",5,2016/01/06
4,REDACTED,en,4873,It took me sometime to choose a hotel for a leisure trip to Tokyo with my wife. Very near the Tokyo station and a stones throw away from a subway station. Loved this small hotel. The room was very clean and comfortable. The staff was fantastic. They were very helpful and friendly. Would love to stay here again but it is always fully-booked.,5,2016/01/04
4,REDACTED,en,4874,"We stayed just over a week at Hotel Ryumeikan Tokyo as we made quite a lot of trips to nearby areas and cities. The 3 minutes walk to the Tokyo station and 1 minute walk to the Nihombashi metro station is very appealing. We got to stay in both the standard single and Forus-A rooms. Both had very comfortable beds. Between the two, we much preferred the Forus room because of much more space, bigger bed and more amenities, despite the downsides of facing the wall of the next building and lack of a bathtub. There is free wifi throughout the hotel. We liked the coin operated laundry on 10th and 12th floors. The hotel's restaurant was good despite the limited menu. Ryumeikan also has excellent service, with the staff endeavoring to fulfill our requests such as baggage storage, helping us move our baggage to cab and helping make restaurant reservations.",5,2016/01/03
4,REDACTED,en,4875,Business hotel in the top floors of a 15 storeys building located nearby the Tokyo station. Walking distance from all major shopping streets and malls. The towers of all majors Japanese trading houses are all around.,3,2015/12/26
4,REDACTED,en,4876,"Hotel Ryumeikan Tokyo's Suite A stands out as one of the unique hotel-stay that we have experienced. Bearing in mind that this is a suite, it still serves as a useful benchmark to compare experiences of other hotels' rooms with.

We took with us the zen-like experience of the Tatami mat room, the polished floor of the western room, and the well-appointed suite bathroom with its warm Toto toilet that anticipated our arrival.

Outstanding!",5,2015/12/22

",4,2015/12/22
4,REDACTED,en,4878,We stayed in this hotel for five nights and had two rooms. We loved the hotel. The location was so convenient being right by Tokyo station. We found it easily after arriving from the airport on the Narita express thanks to previous reviews mentioning the Yaesu north exit of the station. Though the station is huge once you get the hang of the various exits it is easy to negotiate. There are lots of restaurants in the station and also in the streets around the hotel. There is a cafe a few doors along where we would have a bagel and a coffee for breakfast. The rooms were well appointed and our 20 year old daughter felt safe in a room on her own (as she did throughout Japan). The hotel were very accommodating in giving us rooms relatively close together and were very apologetic because we could not have adjoining rooms as the rooms were of different types. I have never seen such an extensive array of toiletries etc in a hotel room. We also liked the Yukatas which were comfortable to wear. The beds were comfortable and the shower powerful. The room was also very quiet. We could not hear other guests at all. The free wifi worked fine. We would definitely stay again at this hotel.,5,2015/12/22
4,REDACTED,en,4879,"Was there for holiday and the location is great. Several delicious restaurants nearby and the subway and Tokyo station are just around the corner. In the night it is very quiet as well daily, so no worries if one need quietness for jet lag sleep. There are tea for free at the reception. As usual, very clean and friendly personal!",5,2015/12/20
4,REDACTED,en,4880,Clean and comfortable stay at this hotel. Near the Tokyo mrt stain station with many eateries around that area. Staff are friendly and always willing to help. Will come back again to this hotel. Stayed only 1 night here en route to Kyoto.,4,2015/12/15

4,REDACTED,en,4882,"The hotel situation a short 5 mins from Tokyo Station is spacious. Our room on the 11th floor was very comfortable for our traveling party of 3 persons, each with a wide single bed. The area is quiet but easily accessible to restaurants and cafe. The family mart is right next door.",4,2015/12/11
4,REDACTED,en,4883,"For those who want to stay around the busy and bustling Tokyo Station or need to stay only for a day or two in Tokyo, this hotel is the one. It is only 3 minutes walking from Tokyo Station North Yaesu exit, a convenient walk from the station. If you are only staying for a day or two, you do not need to stay in Shinjuku or Shibuya as Tokyo Station is the central area where almost all train and shinkansen stop, not to mention the shopping area around it is huge as well as it is close to Marunouchi and the Imperial Palace, all within walking distance. 

There are a lot of food catering facilities nearby, they open till late with a good variety (from fast food, ramen shop to western/Italian, etc). 

The hotel itself is quite modern and clean, with comfortable bed. The room size is the standard business hotel room in Japan (don't expect it to be spacious like staying in western style hotels, but for those who have been to Japan before and stay at business hotels, you know what I mean). It has free wi-fi, not super fast but you can live with it. The lobby is on Level 12 and the hotel itself also has a good restaurant, apparently quite well known. 

Would not mind coming back and stay at this hotel again next time I am in Tokyo.",5,2015/12/09
4,REDACTED,en,4884,Enjoyed our stay at this superbly located hotel. Tokyo Station was a mere 5 minute walk and the amenities of this hotel were second to none. The size of the semi-double bed was more than adequate and the lack of storage was the only negative. We expected this given that we had selected the hotel's cosiest offering. The staff were excellent and we wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.,5,2015/11/24
4,REDACTED,en,4885,"This hotel is just in front of Tokyo Station, Yaesu side. It is very easy to access and connect to everywhere in Tokyo. Service is very good. Room space is adequate. Bathroom is big though. Asking for station view, you can take photo of the station and lighting during sunset.",5,2015/11/18
4,REDACTED,en,4886,"I stayed extra after a business trip and used the Ryumeikan Hotel as a base for sightseeing. Not even a 5 minute walk from the North East (Yaesu North) exit from Tokyo Station. Coffee shop and restaurants right next door. I stayed in an economy double room which was nicely appointed though small. It was aptly named. No view but I was looking for value. Desk staff was very nice, friendly, and helpful in dealing with my English only communication.
I would stay there again as it was a good value and great location for exploring Tokyo.",4,2015/11/17
4,REDACTED,en,4887,"We had great online support from Shiori and Atsuko via email even before we arrived. They patiently dealt with the many questions we had in our first visit to Tokyo and booked restaurants for us.
The hotel is well-situated - 5-10min from Tokyo and Nhombashi stations. The Asakusa/Keikyu line stops at the latter with direct access to Haneda airport, but the mostly underground walk is about half a km from the train to the hotel door. The hotel does not have a front porch for cabs and guests with heavy luggage will have difficulties in the rain. There is a convenience store downstairs. The lobby and hotel restaurant are on the highest/15th floor. There is easy walking access to the Daimaru and Coredo department stores as well.
We stayed twice here, using both the Forus B and C rooms. A Large TV with English channels is available.There is video-on-demand with a card purchasable from vending room on each floor. There were good toiletries in large bottles, purchasable if desired.
The hotel gave nice complementary snacks and lots of free bottled water - 2 in fridge and 2 outside that we used tfor the free Nespresso machine. Both Western pajamas and yukatas were available for use. The Forus B/smaller room featured a bed with soothing music and vibration to encourage sleep - quite special! WiFi was free in room, with good signal strength.
The hotel breakfast on Sunday stretched till lunchtime. It is possible to sit there and wait for the buffet menu to change. We were well-satisfied with the quality and range of food available. If there weren't so many great places to eat around the hotel I would not have minded eating there every day. Would return if back in Tokyo!",5,2015/11/16

4,REDACTED,en,4890,"Firstly the negatives...it took me ages to find this hotel, but partly to blame was my jet lag and a relatively confusing central station if you don't know which exit you are looking for and the restaurant staff kept getting our order wrong. Now the positives: friendly staff, really nice room (albeit a bit small but for one night only it did the job), great bathroom with an overabundent supply of great products. The location is actually perfect if you want central Tokyo. Central station is over the road, some nice areas close by. As for the restaurant, the food was lovely and the staff were very friendly even if we got the wrong order a couple of times. I would happily stay here again.",4,2015/11/03
4,REDACTED,en,4891,"This is my favourite hotel. We stayed here on our first visit to Japan and were fortunate to spend another two nights here this trip. I had a one night booking in which the only room available at the time of booking was a standard (I had stayed in a FORUS A previously) and then had a cancelled flight led us to spend an extra night in Tokyo. The room we booked for that night was the FORUS B. 

The rooms of this hotel, both standard and FORUS are exceptional. The FORUS B is spacious and luxurious. The beds are comfortable and bathroom facilities and toiletry range exceptional. 

The best thing about this hotel is the staff. They went our of their way to help us with our changed holiday plans (caused by a typhoon). Our Japanese language is limited so the staff called our next hotel and explained we would be a day late in arriving.

The location of this hotel is fantastic. Across the road from Tokyo JR station with the airport bus stop outside of the hotel. 

I would not hesitate to recommend Hotel Ryumeikan and hope to stay here again.",5,2015/11/01

4,REDACTED,en,4894,"This was our first stop off on our 2 week holiday in Japan and our first of 2 hotels in Tokyo. We had a Forus A Discovery room and it was small but had everything that you need.
The location was excellent - we came straight out of Tokyo station from the airport and had no trouble finding the hotel. The staff were very friendly - we arrived before our check in time and they kept our bags for us. They were a bit strict about check in time of 2:00 but we found everywhere in Japan was like that. 
The room was very nice and modern. My husband loved the nespresso machine and the shower was definitely the best we had all holiday! The alarm system is a bit interesting, we didn't end up using it but we enjoyed playing around with it! The yukatas were also very nice and the room was lovely and clean.
We would definitely recommend this anyone in Tokyo - the area is quite businessy which was fine for us. For our second stay in Tokyo we stayed in Shinjuku which was very different so a nice balance. It was handy to be able to go to Tokyo station if we couldn't be bothered to walk far for some food etc.",5,2015/10/27
4,REDACTED,en,4895,"Pros: Walking distance to Tokyo station, great transport links to both Narita and Haneda airports, lots of shops and restaurants nearby. Staff speak good English, very helpful.
I had a Forus A single room for 3 nights in Oct 2015. Room is spacious by Tokyo standards. The sleeping system is an interesting idea and I quite like it. Coffee machine a bonus. 
Cons: like most Japanese hotels, duvet is very warm (I had to get a blanket from reception) and mattress super firm. There were 5 pillows in the room but none of them very good...if not for the bedding I'd give it 5 stars.",4,2015/10/26
4,REDACTED,en,4896,"The hotel room is quite small (about 20sq meters), which was expected for a tokyo hotel i think. That's pretty much the only negative thing i can say about this hotel.

Check-in was fast and efficient. Lobby was located on the top floor so you dont get to see front desk daily. But everytime i needed something, they seem very friendly and helpful. Normally I would only ask for maps of a certain prefecture. But once I was having a hard time booking our Mt fuji trip, they were very helpful in assisting me. They called the company and help me book. They even got the reference number just to be sure that everything goes well with my booking.

The location was great. About 5 minutes away from tokyo station. Plenty of shops, restos and stores around the area. Of course, being near tokyo station, very accessible for travel.

The room was small but it has everything that you need for travelling. There's nespresso for my coffee fix. The toiletries were abundant. They even have facial cleansers for me and my wife. Bed was very comfortable. Wifi was great! not much english channels though which wasnt much of a problem.

Overall, very good hotel. Value for money.",5,2015/10/26
4,REDACTED,en,4897,"Situated a couple of blocks across from Tokyo station, Hotel Ryumeikan offers a wonderfully comfortable nest for easy traveling in and around Tokyo. My one-person efficiency room was a beauty and way more spacious than I had expected (could easily sleep two tbh). The room offered pod coffees and even had some cracker snacks which came in handy when I was hungry but too tired/lazy to go out and hunt for food late at night. The best thing though, is the immaculate service. The staff is quite fabulous at attending to your every needs. Great experience staying here, and I would definitely return (which, for someone who likes to always try out new places, says a lot!).",5,2015/10/19
4,REDACTED,en,4898,"I have stayed in a number of mid-range business hotels in Tokyo and other Japanese cities ranging from fairly good to quite bad but this was by far the best of them. It's normal room rates are higher than many lesser business hotels but they have two good plans for 30% or 20% discount for payment in advance that bring them down to an affordable level.

The location of the hotel is excellent, very close to Tokyo station and two Metro stations in an excellent area for shopping and dining. Despite this location, it is an oasis of quiet and calm. The rooms are a good size for Tokyo hotels, scrupulously clean, comfortable and well equipped. The staff are helpful and the hotel's own restaurant is a great place for a Japanese breakfast.

To get a better hotel in Tokyo would cost much more and I would highly recommend this one.",5,2015/10/18
4,REDACTED,en,4899,"I stayed for 2 nights. Although the size of the hotel room is small but the hotel is among the best that I have stayed in Tokyo. Location is superb as this is only 3 to 4 mins walk from Tokyo station and travelling to Haneda airport is seamless with the JR Line and monorail. There is a bus stop outside the hotel that brings the visitors from Narita airport too. Plenty of food options in the vicinity plus a Family Mart store to offer convenient grocery items and food as well. The reception staff speaks English, toilet amenities are generous and there are complimentary coffee/tea and free postcards and origami paper. The hotel pricing is attractive and I would certainly come back again.",5,2015/10/15
4,REDACTED,en,4900,"Your hotel was recommended by the French Elle magazine and it is what I expected: a clean, quiet hôtel, well located by Tokyo station. The rooms are very well equiped and modern. The staff is friendly and helpful. A very good point of departure hile visiting Tokyo and Japan.",5,2015/10/13
4,REDACTED,en,4901,"Hotel Ryumeikan Tokyo is one of the best hotel I've ever stayed in Tokyo, the location is superb, just a few steps from hotel to Keisei Expressway Bus to Narita airport. Metro and JR is at the door step so you can go every where you want in Tokyo. Room is clean, staff service is excellent and soundproof system is great.

4,REDACTED,en,4902,"We stayed here one night after arriving in Tokyo late at night, with plans to take the train to Osaka the next morning. The hotel is a convenient, short walk from Tokyo Station and well priced. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. The hotel staff was polite and helpful. The rooms are small, but I think that is typical of most hotel rooms in large cities. There is a small 24 hour convenience store next to the hotel which was great for buying bottles of water and a late night snack. I highly recommend this hotel.",4,2015/10/03
4,REDACTED,en,4903,"The primary reason we stayed here was due to proximity to Tokyo Station. We flew in late at night and were catching the train early the next morning. The station is a leisurely 5-10 minute stroll away. The rooms are pretty compact but very functional with no details spared. Our room had the usual touches for Japan such as impeccable cleanliness, fancy toilet and an awesome hair dryer. The parts that were unique included origami paper with some instructions for making cranes, postcard which the hotel will mail out for you for free, above and beyond amount of toiletries (anti-aging cream, shaving cream, aftershave etc) even for Japanese standards. Some free snacks and water were provided in each room. We also enjoyed the comfy and stylish yukata. Overall, a short and sweet stay!",5,2015/10/02
4,REDACTED,en,4904,"This is my forth time to stay in Ryumeikan. Location is good, just 5 minutes walking distance to Tokyo Station. Room is clean with multi function shower, bed and pillows are comfortable. Small room size of Standard type, prefer to stay “Forus” type with bigger room size. Hanger stand area is not big enough even in summer season. Highly recommend if you are looking for hotels in this location.
",4,2015/09/24
4,REDACTED,en,4905,"Situated bang opposite the Tokyo station, it is a good place to use as a base for a business trip. The Reception is situated at the top floor and the Hotel has 8 of the top floors in the building. 

The rooms are very spacious by Tokyo standards. 

The bus from the airport drops you right at the gate of the hotel, which is one of the biggest advantages when you come from the airport. 

All in all, a very convenient place to stay in.",5,2015/09/23
4,REDACTED,en,4906,"My family (2 adults & 2 kids under 10) was fortunate to stay here for 9 nights in a Suite room, which had two rooms plus a large bathroom. The kids slept in a tatami mat room on very comfortable futons and we had two separate single beds in the main room. The room was spotless and we felt extremely comfortable as soon as we opened the door. We rarely saw any other guests or staff - needless to say the room was very quiet and a good nights sleep was had by all every night. As other reviewers have noted the extras such as the Nespresso machine and daily water supplies were appreciated. Location was great as well. Only negative was the lack of natural light and view of the building next door but this is Tokyo. We highly recommended this place.",5,2015/09/22
4,REDACTED,en,4907,I love this hotel! It's so easy to get to from JR rail station. It's nice and fancy. I wanted to comeback after I tour Hokkaido but they are sold out . The reception are friendly and they spoke English well. I will definitely come back here. Highly recommend. Stay here and you will love it too.,5,2015/09/18
4,REDACTED,en,4908,"There is an incredible ninja experience with seeing how much functionality can be jammed into a Japanese sized room. 

Great staff who are willing to help with reservations. This hotel is close to Tokyo station and I've visited a number of times.",4,2015/09/11
4,REDACTED,en,4909,"This was not a big hotel. But, the management and service were just great. The double bed room we had was spacious in Japanese standard. The room was clean and decorations were modern. The bed was comfortable. 

An remarkable thing was the water closet in the washroom was a real state of art and high technology. This was the first fully automatic water closet that I had ever encountered from automatically raising the toilet cover, flushing and closed the cover after one had finished.

The hotel was just beside the Tokyo Central Railway Station and the Airport Bus Stop was just 1 minute walk from the hotel. Therefore, its location was super convenient.

The Japanese style buffet brunch offered by the hotel restaurant was just great in taste, variety and value for money.",5,2015/08/31
4,REDACTED,en,4910,"Great hotel! I have been to Tokyo for 3 times, every time different hotel but this is the best. Have an espresso machine in the room, free mini bar and daily drinks, tibits and even Japanese green tea for you to brew! 

But breakfast could be improved by having international breakfast. The current breakfast is only Japanese breakfast. Could also change the variety of the breakfast as well instead of having the same breakfast.",5,2015/08/29
4,REDACTED,en,4911,"The hotel is well located and provides very good value for the price. The room was a little small, but not bad at all for Tokyo! The service was very nice. We didn't use the restaurant - too many choices nearby around Tokyo station, but it looked nice as well.

",5,2015/08/28
4,REDACTED,en,4912,"We only stayed there for a night before catching our flight home, but it was great. The only downside of the hotel was snobby reception manager, which looked us down as we had bagpacks and made us very unwelcome. Other than that everything was great, good location, clean room.",4,2015/08/28
4,REDACTED,en,4913,This hotel is ideally located near Tokyo Station and has many great food and drink locations nearby. The staff is excellent and rooms are right sized for the region and offer a great space to work and relax. I would highly recommend one of the Focus rooms as they offer the ability to innovate and discover. I will stay again in my next visit to the region.,5,2015/08/27
4,REDACTED,en,4914,"I must say this hotel has been great in many different things: from the staff (absolutely friendly and available) to the position, to the room that has been on average dimension as Japanese hotel, but with BIG bad (finally) and really really clean!! 
I would put 4 stars instead of 5 just cause I saw on Internet that in every room there was a Nespresso coffee machine (and I was desperately looking for a good coffee in the morning) but in ours it didn't...
For all the rest, it deserves 5 star!",5,2015/08/21
4,REDACTED,en,4915,"Good location, about 3 minutes to Narita Bus Express, 7 minutes to Tokyo Station & Daimaru. 24 hour family mart next door, lots of eateries nearby. Walking distance to Palace East Garden. Staff speak English. Clean & nice hotel. Highly recommended.",5,2015/08/19
4,REDACTED,en,4916,"I have stayed at this hotel at least a handful of times now -- obviously it is pleasant enough to keep coming back!

When you come to the check in, they greet you with a cold hand towel when it's hot out, and hot hand towel when it's cold out. This pleasant greeting is the indicator of the positive stay in store. The rooms are quite small, but you won't be spending much time in the room. The Forus A rooms have these fantastic massage sprays, plus a rain shower head and a regular shower head. The other rooms have standard showers. At the end of long days, the massage showers are a true relief. The rooms are very clean and you hear very little from the outside or people in the hallways.

The closest subway stop is Nihonbashi -- literally right around the corner, but also just down the street from the Yaesu North exit out of Tokyo Station. (Go through the two Daimaru stores at street level, cross the street in the crosswalk, stay on the street the station is on, and the building will be on your right side at the end of the street, just past the Family Mart. The location is very convenient if you'll be using your rail pass, and taking day trips on the trains.

During the summer when it's hot, it's also convenient that there's a washing machine on two floors. I never had difficulty accessing it on the multiple stays there, and at a cheaper rate than other hotels. Another convenience is the free Wi-Fi in the rooms -- helpful for keeping in touch with loved ones at home, and for looking up information for the next day.

The staff really make an effort to communicate in English, which is appreciated. They even have a free English newspaper available in the mornings, except on Sunday. The staff are very pleasant and try to accommodate any request. Highly recommend!",5,2015/08/15
4,REDACTED,en,4917,"This hotel is so high tech! 
1) music system
2) Nescafé coffee machine
3) Fully button controlled toilet bowl. Auto flush, auto lift of cover etc... 

I especially love the rain shower! No bathtub is awesome! 

A 5 mins walk with luggage to Tokyo station. 2 mins walk to Metro station. 

Excellent location. 

Totally love the experience. 

Will definitely return and highly recommend to all!",5,2015/08/10
4,REDACTED,en,4918,"This is the hotel I always stay whenever I am in Tokyo. It's a few min walk from Tokyo station. Hotel staff is very friendly, room is clean and modern, has everything one needs. Although the one person room maybe a bit small, but hey this is Tokyo, real estate is expensive. For a moderate price, it's good value for the money.",5,2015/08/07
4,REDACTED,en,4919,"Stayed here for a night to start a week-long trip through Japan. Took the Narita Express into Tokyo station and this hotel was just a 5 minute walk from there. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful and spoke fluent English. Room was big (had a corner twin) and was quiet with very comfortable beds. Bathroom came with a lot of amenities too. Hotel is also located very close to 3 metro spots making it easy to get to where all the action is in Tokyo as this is in the business district. After a 13-hour flight in from NYC, this was a relaxing way to start off a trip.",5,2015/08/04
4,REDACTED,en,4920,"Great place to stay for a short visit, modern and clean. Near the railway station. Beds are comfortable and bathroom perfect. Near the hotel 24/7 supermarkt. 

Take a bigger room to make your stay more comfortable. Big enough and all you need to visit Tokyo",5,2015/07/28
4,REDACTED,en,4921,"For first-timers in Tokyo, this location can't be beat. We took the Keisi bus from Narita and that literally could not be easier. You can see your hotel from the bus stop -- and it's cheaper than all other transport options. We had two side by side rooms (for a family of 4) and they were, as expected, very small. But quiet and genuinely smoke free. I actually opted for the FORUS rooms, thinking the technology aspects would be cool, but in hindsight, definitely not worth forgoing some sunlight from the window (our room faced a wall, about 4 or 5 feet away.) Wished for more English language cable channels - and hated the fact that anytime you went into the bathroom (even in middle of night) the light came on and louds sounds accompanied (automatic flushing, for example). No way to do that quietly and not wake a sleeping partner. But the beds were firm, the air conditioned good, and the service very easy -- everything you need in the room (and free water and nibbles), front desk helpfull reserved bus tickets for us on the way back, and location very easy as a base. You won't be in the happening area of town (it's basically a business district, I think) but we found it a good and easy base.",4,2015/07/26
4,REDACTED,en,4922,"I was looking for a good hotel close to Tokyo station for a 6 night stay. Having done a lot of research, I settled for this one. I could not make a booking 6 months in advance. Availability grid on the hotel website shows no availability that far ahead. This was also not easily bookable on expedia. I simply wrote an email to the hotel and they confirmed the booking very promptly without asking me any questions. No credit card required! 
After some time, I wanted to add another day to my stay and once again very prompt reply to my email confirming the same. 
The hotel website describes several room types in great detail. One must read this carefully to decide what type of room is required. We selected Forus type A- Discovery room. This was just enough for two of us. 
The room and the facilities provided are exactly as described -one hundred percent. Having stayed in several big cities- this is the best hotel I have stayed at. Booking, check in, staff and room facilities score ten out of ten. Location is brilliant- about 3-4 min walk from Yaesu north exit. Arriving on Narita Express, the walk inside Tokyo station is probably longer than outside! A Family Mart next door and a 7/11 shop in the side lane were useful.
Reception desk is on the top floor-15F. Staff speak only working English. Everyone is extremely polite and very helpful. 
The mini fridge in the room was empty and very useful to keep drinks, yogurt, fruits etc. 4 bottles of mineral water every day in the room almost met our daily needs. Tap water is also of very good quality. Tokyo was really hot- 33 degrees and the ice machine on our floor was also very useful. We did not use the washing machine and dryer but I have seen it in use regularly. 
Rooms were exceptionally clean. Very regular provision of all toiletries and coffee machine supplies. My wife is now a fan of the Nespresso machine. 
Wi-fi was very good for connection and speed. We could comfortably use Skype, Facetime and whatapp calling in addition to usual Internet use. 
They had a good selection of award winning post cards in the room which they posted free for us!

Very good toilet. Shower is the best I have seen anywhere. A bit amused by the electronic WC! 
We travelled a lot on Yamanote line and Shinkansen using JR pass and found the proximity of this place to the station very useful even during heavy rain.
There were no problems in the form of – room key card not working, poor quality air conditioning, wifi not connecting, weak shower, inadequate lighting in the room, billing mistakes etc- at least one of these problems I have come across every hotel in the world- but this place is just perfect. 

Overall a brilliant hotel for location, staff, room, amenities and cost. Can not fault them for anything and really surprised as to how they keep everything perfect every day with courtesy and smile! 
Would happily stay again.",5,2015/07/25
4,REDACTED,en,4923,"This is my second time choosing Hotel Ryumeikan Tokyo.
The location of the hotel is great and convenient, just one minute walk to the nihombashi metro staion. This station has three metro lines which can bring you to most of the attractions
The hotel is also opposite to JR Tokyo station where you can find Daimaru and many shopping malls there~JR Tokyo Station is one of the stop of the Narita Express, the hotel suits those who visit Tokyo for their first time as it can be easily found.
Besides, the staff are friendly and can communicate in English. They also helped me to book some famous local restaurants 1.5 month before~ Great~
Price, of course so reasonable and with good quality~
No doubt in my top priority when i visit Tokyo again next time~",5,2015/07/24
4,REDACTED,en,4924,"I stayed at the Ryumeikan for four nights in July on business. Booked in advance, so paid 30% less (see their website). Had a room with a view - of a wall! But that cannot be helped (even at the Marriott in Ginza, there are rooms like that). Room amenities and quality were top notch. Unbeatable location next to Tokyo station and all the trains there, and Nihonbashi subway. Will definitely stay here again.",5,2015/07/24
4,REDACTED,en,4925,"We really can't say enough nice things about this hotel. We loved everything about it... well maybe we didn't love the ""potty porthole"" but that was an epic thing to send photos home about.

If you are looking for excellent service, a centrally located home base in Tokyo, and a comfortable room, then this is the place for you!

Everything was very modern and very clean. The room, as is typical in Japan, was very small. If you have a ton of luggage, you are going to need to store it and we were told you can ask the front desk how to do this. We only had 2 medium bags and these fit well in the room. 

There are tons of places to eat, places to shop, and every single mode of transportation in Tokyo within a 5 minutes walk of this place.

THIS INCLUDES THE EXPRESS BUS TO NARITA AIRPORT! The Tokyo Station bus stop is a few hundred feet from the front door. Don't bother paying more for the JR Train to Narita if you stay here. This was faster and more convenient, unless you just prefer trains there is no reason to spend more for less.

The front desk staff were extremely good at their jobs. They made an instant friend in me when we arrived on an extremely hot day and they noticed I was sweating. They got me an ice-cold towel and a dry one to wipe off with. Check-in and check-out were smooth.

We stayed here on both ends of our trip to Tokyo. Both experiences were superior.

We requested a second set of pillows (they have multiple kinds of pillows to choose from) be delivered to our room on the first night of the first visit and when we arrived for our second visit, the person checking us in mentioned to us that they had taken the liberty of putting 2 extra pillows (the type we had chosen the first time) in our room already. THAT is a perfect example of rock star service. It was a tiny thing that meant nothing, but also meant a great deal to us.

They had slippers you were allowed to take with you and some biscuit/cookie things. There was a mini fridge and complimentary water each day. The room was cool and everything was in perfect working order. The restroom was large enough, the shower was excellent with solid water pressure, and they provided at least 2 dozen different toiletries for your use.

We were so glad we chose this hotel... twice.

The potty porthole is something you have to see for yourself, though. That was weird.",5,2015/07/23
