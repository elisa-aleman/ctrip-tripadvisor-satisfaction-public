1,321,1,The staff here are extremely well trained and helpful.,2017-06-15

1,324,2,"The bus ride is about 45 m (with jam), and from Haneda, about 1000 yen.",2017-06-12
1,324,3,(it would be 3100 yen from Narita).,2017-06-12
1,324,4,"Separately, the hotel is 20 min walk away from Shinjuku station, so they provide a free shuttle service for residents.",2017-06-12

1,324,7,"(yes, cabs in Japan are expensive).",2017-06-12
1,324,8,"Right beside the hotel is a metro station, but I would think the main Shinjuku station is more convenient in getting you around.",2017-06-12
1,324,9,There is also a convenience stall right below it.,2017-06-12
1,324,10,"We took the shuttle bus back to the airport, and that bus does have limited space for big luggages (maybe around 4 - 5 max).",2017-06-12

1,325,4,Breakfast was good.,2017-06-12
1,325,5,The bar area okay but it could do with some atmosphere.,2017-06-12

1,325,7,But if you're after a quite drink to end the night then you'll find it okay.,2017-06-12

1,329,6,A cup of coffee cost $10 and an Asahi was $12.,2017-06-09
1,330,1,"I am delighted that on our second visit to this property (see my other review from 2015) not only it has maintained its exceedingly high standards, but it became even better thanks to improvements to key areas that Honors members appreciate, such as the Executive Lounge, and the opening of a new and superb Japanese-style bento-like breakfast exprience on the 2nd floor (make sure to book).",2017-06-09
1,330,2,"They really appreciate our loyalty, I wish other Hiltons were like that.",2017-06-09

1,330,8,"Well done, Hilton!",2017-06-09
1,331,1,"Fantastic accommodation, rooms are a great size (apposed to the fact Japan is well known for the hotel rooms being small) There is a gorgeous little Jazz bar on the top level of the hotel (absolutely love it) and there are shops bottom level also which the little grocery store is open till a decent time for a night cap ;) the hotel is only a short stroll from Tokyo's busiest district in Shinjuku and I found myself always ending up at the famous Pedestrian Scramble (which was super handy for an easy gauge on location) lost's of places nearby to eat however, there is fantastic restaurant options at the hotel as well.",2017-06-08

1,332,8,The set up was very good again with great service.,2017-06-08
1,332,9,Watch out for the Airport bus - it took me over two hours to get to Narita.,2017-06-08
1,332,10,45 minutes was taken to get around all the stops before we even left the neighbourhood.,2017-06-08
1,332,11,The bus is much cheaper than a taxi but the Hotel told me we would be one of the last stops and go straight out to the airport.,2017-06-08

1,334,1,We booked a 2 night stay at the Hilton Tokyo during our opening first few nights of a 2 week trip to Japan.,2017-06-07
1,334,2,"We decided to do something less expensive (around $350.00 USD per night) while breaking in our jet lag before jumping up in cost for nicer resorts and ryokans like the Aman, Asaba, Four Seasons Kyoto, and Zaborin in Hokkaido.",2017-06-07

1,334,4,Their overall service was very good too.,2017-06-07
1,334,5,Our only real complaint was that it was the only place we stayed in our entire 2 week trip to Japan that didn't offer free WIFI?!,2017-06-07

1,334,7,seriously?,2017-06-07

1,334,10,"The hotel charges $10.00 USD per day for basic WIFI, and an astounding $20.00 USD per day for faster WIFI.",2017-06-07
1,334,11,We simply couldn't wrap our heads around this why any 'nice' hotel in today's age would charge for WIFI.,2017-06-07
1,334,12,So that was a big ding for us.,2017-06-07
1,334,13,"If it wasn't for everything else that the hotel did well, we would have given this rating an 'average' review.",2017-06-07

1,336,4,"Breakfast was ok, friendly staff - but very crowded.",2017-06-06
1,336,5,Will likely not to return - had visited other properties around - name is not everything Hilton!,2017-06-06

1,337,2,Staffs are very courteous.,2017-06-06

1,355,6,"Despite its size, the 1st floor lobby offers a small sitting area.",2017-05-26
1,355,7,"Because there is a large eating area occupying half of the floor, I only saw 2 arm chairs and 2 back to back couches (allowing maybe 10 to 12 people to sit).",2017-05-26
1,355,8,"As to the shower in our room, the glass panel on the tub was too short in my opinion.",2017-05-26
1,355,9,I prefer a wall to wall panel so that you can take a shower without worrying about spilling and splashing water to the bathroom floor.,2017-05-26
1,355,10,The hotel has few restaurants (look great but on expensive side).,2017-05-26

1,356,2,"Most hotels were fully booked and overpriced for a small room, hence we decided to spend just a little bit more and got the Suite in Hilton Tokyo.",2017-05-26
1,356,3,"Location: Strategically located in Shinjuku, it is a great tourist spot which is convenient but not in the midst of the hustle and bustle.",2017-05-26

1,356,14,The bathroom was a little small for a large room and the shower area is a little tiny which shares a relatively small bathtub.,2017-05-26
1,356,15,However I liked the strong water pressure and the Thomas Roth toiletries provided.,2017-05-26
1,356,16,Lounge: Staying in a suite means we get free access to the club lounge.,2017-05-26
1,356,17,"As a typical international hotel chain, the lounge was big and had lots of variety of food and beverages, including all kinds of alcohol.",2017-05-26
1,356,18,The only downside was that it was VERY CROWDED.,2017-05-26
1,356,19,It's almost packed every evening when we were there (around 5/6pm) and this means that it can be a little rowdy.,2017-05-26

1,438,10,But you are made to feel like nothing special here.,2017-04-18
1,438,11,The Bad ,2017-04-18

1,438,14,Felt really un-neccessary.,2017-04-18

1,438,16,It was either forgotten or we were brought the wrong drink.,2017-04-18
1,438,17,"3. When asking concierge if I could get an english menu for room service, I was made to feel really dumb for not realising it wasn't in the book but on the TV.",2017-04-18

1,439,1,As an HHonors member I've stayed at several Hiltons and have come to expect a solid 4/5 standard and have rarely been disappointed.,2017-04-17
1,439,2,"What pushed this experience up to 5/5 was this: I arrived early and reception said that although the hotel was fully booked they would be able to let me check in early if I didn't mind having a room with a connecting door to the next room (locked, of course).",2017-04-17
1,439,3,"I don't mind a connecting door, and I've stayed in such rooms many times, but I have never EVER before been asked by reception whether it would be OK!",2017-04-17
1,439,4,I appreciated the extra courtesy and will definitely consider the Hilton Tokyo if I ever have a chance to return to Tokyo with some more time -- this was a brief three-day business trip.,2017-04-17

1,441,8,Word to the wise: this hotel is about 1 kilometer from Shinjuku station.,2017-04-17

1,447,1,"As a diamond member of Hilton HHonors I was rather surprised not to receive the welcome letter,amenity and room upgrade that I have always received in the past when checking in to Hiltons in Asian cities.",2017-04-16
1,447,2,I was even more surprised to be told that I could not use the regular executive lounge in the evenings but rather a smaller one for loyalty guests.,2017-04-16
1,447,3,But it was uphill from there.,2017-04-16
1,447,4,"Our room was fine (other than what seems increasingly inevitable - screaming kid next door), and the executive lounge was terrific, and everywhere was smoke-free.",2017-04-16

1,456,6,The executive room on the 37th floor is excellent as well with a great view and great food.The only drawback was that in Japan they only allow three people in a room so we had to get two rooms which was a bit costly.,2017-04-15
1,457,1,This supposed to be 5 star hotel does not give any preference for its hotel guests at its restaurants.,2017-04-14
1,457,2,Outside reservations are taken without any area reserved for hotel guests.,2017-04-14
1,457,3,One would expect that premium rates are charged for the rooms so that hotel guests have the rooms and amenities available for their use and it's very disappointing when restaurant reservations are taken from outside walk-ins with no space left for hotel guests!,2017-04-14
1,457,4,Looks like making money at any cost is the top priority!,2017-04-14

1,459,3,Bathroom was also very small - especially compared to the IC Hotels we stay at and the seat did not have the all the heating/washing options we had at all the other hotels we stayed at in Japan.,2017-04-13
1,459,4,We stocked up on snacks from the Family Mart down the street which made for a good late night snack on return from a busy day.,2017-04-13
1,459,5,At first they wanted to charge us for wi-fi in the room because I had not booked directly on the Hilton site - which is one of the reasons I normally don't bother with Hilton any more - they are one of the few major brands left that continue to charge for wi-fi - however the woman on the desk relented and gave us free wi-fi.,2017-04-13
1,459,6,There is a free shuttle from Shinjuku JR but we could not find it - gave up and took a taxi.,2017-04-13
1,459,7,Not sure if it is value for money as we simply slept there as we were out all day/evening and think I will stay with IC next time I am in Tokyo.,2017-04-13

1,461,12,Would stay here again.,2017-04-12
1,462,1,Stayed here after a few nights at Intercontinental Tokyo Bay. We actually preferred the IC and Tokyo Bay-- felt a bit quieter and actually easier to access the rail lines surprisingly!,2017-04-11
1,462,2,It was a bit of a trek to get where you needed to go and we found taxi was simply faster and not too bad to get to the night district.,2017-04-11
1,462,3,"We had requested an early room and could not get it and email and service was less than responsive in pre-arrival, but the guest relations manager really went above and beyond in helping us with making things right.",2017-04-11
1,462,4,The morning breakfast was quite extensive and a good way to start a day of site-seeing.,2017-04-11
1,462,5,Do yourself a favor and stock up on beer/snacks at the Family Mart down below and save a few $!,2017-04-11

1,463,8,"They made suggestions, helped us transfer our luggage to Kyoto, held luggage for our return, made reservations for an airport transfer and answered any and all questions.",2017-04-11
1,463,9,They were genuinely delighted to have us in Tokyo and to help us in any way they could.,2017-04-11
1,463,10,I highly recommend the Hilton Tokyo.,2017-04-11
1,464,1,"So, a Hilton is a Hilton.",2017-04-10
1,464,2,"This one is pretty good, but we thought incredibly overpriced for what it was.",2017-04-10
1,464,3,"Our room was TINY TINY, with two twin beds, even though I had booked a king room.",2017-04-10
1,464,4,"And when I say TINY, I mean TINY ...",2017-04-10

1,469,4,We received a high floor room and the view was really great.,2017-04-08

1,469,7,"With one sink, toilet, walk-in shower and bathtub you cannot use the bath with two pax at the same time.",2017-04-08

1,469,14,We stayed four nights and would definitely come back.,2017-04-08
1,469,15,"In my personal opinion the Hilton is a very good hotel, just not *exactly* 5 star (more like 4,5*) considering services like turndown service, fresh water, welcome amenities, etc that you might get in high-end 5-stars.",2017-04-08
1,469,16,We are happy with the choice.,2017-04-08
1,470,1,I stayed here for four nights at the end of November 2016.,2017-04-08
1,470,2,"Shinjuku is a very good base for a tourist, and the Tokyo Hilton the best option in Shinjuku, starting with the fact that the airport limousine bus will drop you right at the hotel - important when you've just got off a long flight and need looking after.",2017-04-08

1,473,2,The app only provided us with two rooms to choose from which didn't notify us that it was a smoking room.,2017-04-07
1,473,3,In addition to this when the room was booked we specifically requested non-smoking.,2017-04-07
1,473,4,They then told us that there are no more rooms available and that we would have to sleep in the rooms overnight before they could change our rooms.,2017-04-07
1,473,5,It wasn't only until after I complained stating that I wouldn't sleep in a room that smells of smoke that they found us a room that we would be able to sleep in but would have to leave by 8am the next morning due to another guest having to move in.,2017-04-07
1,473,6,Regardless of the fact that when we came to check in earlier at around 12pm we were told our room wasn't ready (if we were able to see the room earlier would have been able to notify them of the issue).,2017-04-07
1,473,7,Great way to treat your guests Hilton....,2017-04-07

1,556,2,"this time I also got a nice upgrade, but no early check in (I'm a Honors Diamond member).",2017-02-13
1,556,3,The issue this time was the executive lounge.,2017-02-13
1,556,4,It was so crowded and overfilled I was told to go and wait in my room and they would call me when/if it was any seat available!!,2017-02-13
1,556,5,"This is access people indirectly pay for by booking executive rooms, so this is not acceptable.",2017-02-13

1,557,5,We had our own quieter more intimate dining area on like the 27th floor and nearby we also had a smaller exclusive bar area as well.,2017-02-13
1,557,6,Be aware that the restaurants on the bottom floor are a little on the pricier side but that's about par for the course in most Tokyo restaurants of that quality.,2017-02-13
1,557,7,On a different note all of the areas had these cool automatic air freshener dispensers that dispensed the best smelling air freshener ever.,2017-02-13
1,557,8,"The hotel offers a swimming pool, a nice work out area that includes a smith machine and free-weights, and to my surprise a tennis court (though you need to have your own racquets).",2017-02-13
1,557,9,"The room we stayed in was a suite that had a spacious bathroom, a large sectional couch, and two slightly larger than twin sized beds that were probably the comfiest beds I've ever stayed in and I'm not just saying that because I was sleep deprived.",2017-02-13
1,557,10,The bathroom was pretty sweet with a tub and a shower but most importantly it had a futuristic Japanese toilet with a heated seat and a function that sprayed deodorizer into the toilet after every 5 minutes of sitting there.,2017-02-13

1,557,12,Most impressively he was able to map us out clear directions from our hotel to Tokyo Disney by way of the subway.,2017-02-13
1,557,13,I would highly recommend the Hilton Tokyo in Shinjuku.,2017-02-13

1,558,1,Too many little things that were wrong that ruined the whole experience.,2017-02-13

1,559,3,"I kept my fingers crossed as it was my first time staying at a Hilton hotel (a restaurant experience at the Hilton Paddington in London some time back had left much to be desired); however, several years ago, I had stayed at the Conrad in Bangkok and that was lovely.",2017-02-13

1,559,7,I liked the impressively expansive sofa which was perfect for lounging around.,2017-02-13

1,559,9,"(My mum enjoyed the onsen egg and free-flow of champagne, while my favourite was the superb dashi that went with the soba served on certain evenings!)",2017-02-13
1,559,10,"- As it got quite monotonous after a few days and nights of having almost identical meals at the Executive Lounge, it was wonderful of the staff to offer us an additional option of having the delightful Japanese breakfast at Junisoh on the second floor.",2017-02-13
1,559,11,"- Professional, English-speaking staff on the 37th floor.",2017-02-13
1,559,12,"One evening, as the older folks were just too tired to do much, we had the help of a most obliging lady who arranged to have a few dishes delivered from Chinese restaurant Dynasty.",2017-02-13
1,559,13,"(I think she was bespectacled and I can't remember her name, but she really smoothened matters by acceding to our unusual, last minute request.) Two others with easier names to recall were Andrea and Makoto, who also helped with occasional requests such as restaurant reservations.",2017-02-13
1,559,14,The concierge staff at the lobby were also helpful with tour bookings.,2017-02-13
1,559,15,- Hiltopia with its shops and the 24-hour convenience store as well as the Hilton shuttle bus were especially useful for the senior folks to explore and get around comfortably.,2017-02-13

1,559,19,We not only had breakfast at Junisoh but also enjoyed two delightful Teppanyaki dinners there.,2017-02-13
1,559,20,"The cons/""areas for improvement"":",2017-02-13
1,559,21,- We would have loved a higher floor for our junior suite.,2017-02-13
1,559,22,"A room three levels higher on the 14th floor wasn't ready upon check-in, and interestingly, it ended up being our cousin's when she arrived a day later.",2017-02-13
1,559,23,"The king suite was on the 18th floor and that was fine, although the hotel has close to 40 floors.",2017-02-13
1,559,24,"- The bathrooms were a bit small, although I know we're talking about Tokyo here.",2017-02-13
1,559,25,"All the same, I can't help thinking that the rooms at the Granvia Kyoto were a lot more spacious (bathrooms and wide-ranging toiletries too!) and they weren't even suites.",2017-02-13
1,559,26,"- Whilst the cleaners were obliging the couple of times we bumped into them, we found the cleaning somewhat inconsistent in terms of thoroughness.",2017-02-13
1,559,27,The bin under the writing desk was sometimes not emptied.,2017-02-13
1,559,28,"- While a crowded hotel lobby may have been evidence of a popular hotel, I found the area could have benefited from better crowd control.",2017-02-13
1,559,29,"- We telephoned from our room for help with our luggage as we prepared to leave the hotel on 5 February, but the bell hop never came.",2017-02-13

1,559,31,(I say we struggled because I had my 77-year-old mother with me and we had four pieces of luggage.),2017-02-13
1,559,32,"With hindsight, literally for ""a change of scenery"", we could have, at least for a few nights, tried a more centrally located hotel that makes time-consuming shuttle bus rides unnecessary.",2017-02-13
1,559,33,"We also could have stayed a couple of nights in Hakone or some place more scenic and tranquil, away from the mad rush.",2017-02-13
1,559,34,"All in all, we enjoyed our stay.",2017-02-13
1,559,35,"It certainly helped that the rooms were pleasant and comfortable, that there was Executive Lounge access, that there were obliging English-speaking staff and that there was enough in and around the hotel to keep the senior folks in our group sufficiently entertained.",2017-02-13

1,563,9,Easy access to trains.,2017-02-07
1,563,10,Tokyo Medical University Hospital nearby means you might hear ambulance sirens and strange vocal warnings from ambulance drivers on loudspeakers - a bit noisy at night even when there is little traffic.,2017-02-07

1,601,8,"A helpful point, to get Elite benefits any longer you must book your reservation directly via Hilton or a higher end travel agent, you will not get them if you book through the online discounters (expedia, priceline,etc); ie, booking via the discounters, whose pricing was the same but only with a longer cancellation window, would have cost me in real dollars an extra $200 nightly between breakfast and the rollaway.",2017-01-08

1,661,3,We stayed in an executive standard king room this time (we got an upgrade to a tower suite the last time which was very lucky).,2016-11-23
1,661,4,And even though this is obviously smaller than the suite it is roomy enough for two and very comfortable.,2016-11-23
1,661,5,The bathrooms are smaller than average but that's a Japanese thing and is not a criticism.,2016-11-23
1,661,6,The combination wet room/deep bath is quirky and the hot water runs long and soothingly.,2016-11-23
1,661,7,"But by far the best thing about this hotel is that for Diamond members you get access to the sumptuous breakfast buffet in the lobby - tip, come early if you can because the queues can be massive - and you also get access to a very secret other benefit which I won't ruin here.",2016-11-23
1,661,8,Suffice to say it's something I've not come across at any other Hilton yet.,2016-11-23

1,663,3,"Upon accessing the Lounge, we were sat down, and asked if we'd like a view of Mt. Fuji, at which point the screens were opened and there he was in all his glory!",2016-11-21
1,663,4,What a fabulous start to the holiday!,2016-11-21

1,663,6,There was a nice big couch (which allowed both of us to lie on it and watch TV) and a view over Shinjuku.,2016-11-21
1,663,7,There's only one of these rooms on each floor (looking at the floor plan on the back of the door) and it's right next to the lift lobby - but honestly - we didn't hear a thing the whole time we were there.,2016-11-21
1,663,8,"The bedding was fantastic, and the air conditioning very cool.",2016-11-21
1,663,9,"The yukata's were comfortable, and the bathroom was good.",2016-11-21
1,663,10,"Our only gripe would be that the bathroom was very very small, and the arrangement of the shower door meant that we actually had to step out into the room while we were wet to close the door behind us and then go back into the bathroom to towel off.",2016-11-21
1,663,11,Not a big deal.,2016-11-21

1,663,18,"Only once did it look like the bus would be full, but we squeezed on anyway.",2016-11-21
1,663,19,"The staff was great, from helping us post postcards (old school!), making and confirming dinner reservations and even organizing the shipping of our luggage on to Kyoto they couldn't have been more accommodating - and language was never a barrier (if you talked clearly, slowly and not hysterically like some people next to us one morning!)",2016-11-21
1,663,20,"We were only there for 5 nights, and in reality I couldn't suggest if it's the best location or not to stay in in Tokyo - but I'd certainly recommend it for anyone who wanted to stay in Tokyo.",2016-11-21
1,664,1,Stayed at this hotel for our whisky and foodie holiday trip.,2016-11-20
1,664,2,First the good : the service is good and they do run a shuttle to the Shinjuku fro where you can start your foodie and shopping trips...but honestly it's a bit off The Central whisky and good joints.,2016-11-20
1,664,3,We stayed at the club floor but oftentimes the club level was very full and thus breakfast became a chore...maybe we were there during the busy period.,2016-11-20

1,671,3,"CONSs: regular rooms are tokyo-sized; the lobby is not a large, spacy one, as they priviledged the seating area for the lobby restaurant.",2016-11-14
1,671,4,It can get crowdy and make you feel in a small hotel.,2016-11-14
1,671,5,"CONCLUSION: for a rate of circa 300USD/night you may expect larger rooms, larger and magnificent lobby.",2016-11-14

1,682,9,"My only complaint on that aspect is that the shuttle doesn't run 24/7, so by the time we got to Shinjuku from the airport with an international flight, it was too late and the shuttle wasn't running anymore.",2016-11-09
1,682,10,It's a far enough walk with luggage and kids that we ended up having to take a cab.,2016-11-09

1,789,5,"As such, we expected the Tokyo Hilton to be business centric.",2016-09-13
1,789,6,It is not.,2016-09-13
1,789,7,"In fact, I would go as far as to say, that if you come to Tokyo on business, do not stay here.",2016-09-13
1,789,8,It simply isn't suitable.,2016-09-13
1,789,9,"Upon checking in at midnight, we were advised that the Business Centre would be open in the morning, and able to provide translation services for us.",2016-09-13
1,789,10,This wasn't the case.,2016-09-13
1,789,11,"The ""Business Centre"" isn't actually a Business Centre at all.",2016-09-13
1,789,12,It is simply a large open-plan floor area with a few PCs and desks.,2016-09-13
1,789,13,"This might suit some, but when business guests need assistance to resolve business queries you need staff, but the hotel doesn't employ any in the Business Centre.",2016-09-13
1,789,14,Not even one.,2016-09-13
1,789,15,"Also, you would expect a Business Centre to at least have a phone, yet this one doesn't.",2016-09-13
1,789,16,"Similarly, it doesn't have any meeting rooms either, so if you want privacy you can't get any.",2016-09-13

1,789,20,I have posted a picture of us trying to work at the same time as the flight crew of a Lufthansa jet were being checked in around us.,2016-09-13
1,789,21,How bizarre - especially when you consider the check-in desk is some 100m away.,2016-09-13
1,789,22,"As there were no dedicated Business Centre staff, we had to hire in a translator to help with the communications.",2016-09-13
1,789,23,"Not ideal, but on its own not a deal breaker either.",2016-09-13
1,789,24,"However, without a quiet room to work from or a phone to work with, we were forced to retreat to our bedroom to make the calls.",2016-09-13
1,789,25,Now this was a deal breaker and unacceptable having strangers in your room plus other work colleagues perching on the edge of the bed.,2016-09-13
1,789,26,"In defence of the management, they did offer to help out using Guest Services and the Concierge - so they at least tried.",2016-09-13

1,791,2,"The hotel is crowded, has a lot of guests, and as a result, value of HHonors seems to have reduced over time.",2016-09-13
1,791,3,"Despite HHonors Gold status for 3 years, I was not given a room upgrade on check-in, and even after I was told I would be upgraded on my last day, I was upgraded to an executive suite only with basic amenities and the same size of the room.",2016-09-13
1,791,4,"During the entire time, it was almost like they were doing me a favor.",2016-09-13

1,791,6,He is also a Gold member.,2016-09-13
1,791,7,He was upgraded to a two single bed Executive Suite.,2016-09-13
1,791,8,I got a feeling this hotel does not truly want to upgrade Gold members.,2016-09-13

1,802,1,"I have been a regular guest of this hotel since the 1990s, and I have mixed feelings about what this hotel has become.",2016-09-05
1,802,2,"The rooms are spacious by the Japanese standards, and the location is good--within walking distance (10+ minutes) of the central areas of Shinjuku but not in the middle of the craziness.",2016-09-05
1,802,3,"Also, the hotel offers a range of restaurant options.",2016-09-05
1,802,4,"The shuttle service to JR Shinjuku Station, Airport Limousine Bus, etc., too, are quite useful.",2016-09-05
1,802,5,"Also, the recent renovations made their rooms more pleasant.",2016-09-05
1,802,6,"With this said, I feel compelled to point out that they aren't what they used to be.",2016-09-05
1,802,7,"I miss the smooth transactions I used to enjoy at the reception desk, for instance.",2016-09-05
1,802,8,"Although there is a person or two directing guests, the U-shaped reception area can now create a chaotic impression--with a dramatic increase in the number of non-Japanese Asian guests who do tend to be quite loud and ignore the line(s)/staff directions.",2016-09-05
1,802,9,The breakfast is the same way.,2016-09-05
1,802,10,"Although the selection is a little limited, if you have lounge access, it would be wise to utilize the Exec Lounge for breakfast because the 1st-floor restaurant can get absolutely chaotic--and I don't remember this happening until a few years ago.",2016-09-05
1,802,11,Perhaps it's time for them to implement some serious crowd-control strategies.,2016-09-05
1,802,12,"The quality of the front desk staff, too, has become a little inconsistent in the recent years, in my view.",2016-09-05
1,802,13,"For instance, the last time my same-sex spouse and I checked in, the Japanese male agent wanted to confirm a couple of times that we knew our junior suite only had one king-size bed.",2016-09-05
1,802,14,"When he realized that we were a couple, his attitude changed completely.",2016-09-05
1,802,15,"It's 2016, and it is Hilton.",2016-09-05
1,802,16,"Maybe the manager needs to remind the employees that, at times, they may get same-sex couples whom they should treat with equal respect?",2016-09-05
1,802,17,"This was shocking to me because, in my 20+ years of visiting Japan frequently, I've found the Japanese--male or female--to be very gay friendly.",2016-09-05
1,802,18,"More importantly, my spouse and I have been staying at Hilton Tokyo since the 1990s, and this has never happened before.",2016-09-05
1,802,19,"On another recent occasion, a European male employee took care of the check-out process.",2016-09-05
1,802,20,"For some reason, he rushed us so badly that he didn't even tell us the total charges and merely handed over an envelope with the folio as he asked about our credit card (it wasn't even crowded).",2016-09-05
1,802,21,"Although he had been friendly up to that point, he made his discontent somewhat clear when I asked him to go over the charges.",2016-09-05
1,802,22,"I should have perhaps pointed out to him that this entire transaction could have been prevented, had he done his job and taken an extra 6.5 seconds to inform us of the total charges.",2016-09-05
1,802,23,"Just 10 years ago, these things would have been unthinkable at Hilton Tokyo.",2016-09-05
1,802,24,"There are so many nice hotels in Tokyo that offer more updated infrastructure, good meal options and great service these days (heck, in Japan, the cheapest of the hotels would give you pretty good service!) but, as an HHonors elite member, I prefer to stick with Hilton.",2016-09-05
1,802,25,"Luckily, another Hilton, Hilton Tokyo Odaiba, has recently opened in (relatively) central Tokyo, and I find its infrastructure, service and meal options to be far superior--although it is in an area that COULD be slightly trickier to navigate.",2016-09-05
1,802,26,"I really WANT TO like Hilton Tokyo and WANT TO stay with them because I prefer Shinjuku over Odaiba, but they have been slipping a little in the recent years.",2016-09-05
1,803,1,The family of four could stay in a junior suite comfortably.,2016-09-04

1,804,2,"I was warmly greeted by the staff, he was all smiley and sincere which I really appreciated after a long ride from narita to the hotel.",2016-09-02
1,804,3,"Check in was pretty quick, however there's no signages to tell you where to stand and wait for check in or out.",2016-09-02
1,804,4,So guests are just standing anywhere and everywhere.,2016-09-02
1,804,5,A little confusing.,2016-09-02
1,804,6,Room was decent and big for Japanese standard but a little worn out.,2016-09-02
1,804,7,"One downside of the room that I really need to point out is the carpet, it looks and feels filthy dirty.",2016-09-02
1,804,8,"I stepped on some sticky residue 3 times and god knows what it is, I had to place napkins on the spots so please do wear the bathroom slippers provided.",2016-09-02
1,804,9,I got them to clean the carpet twice !!,2016-09-02
1,804,10,Generally all the Japanese staff were friendly and helpful I really appreciate it.,2016-09-02
1,804,11,"But this particular staff ""Mari*a"" at the concierge was not very sincere in helping when I asked for directions and informations, she doesn't even look you in the eye and I felt she just wants me to leave her alone.",2016-09-02
1,804,12,So I approach a Japanese staff later and she made it all very clear.,2016-09-02
1,804,13,"I was staying at the Hilton Narita earlier in August, I must say Hilton Tokyo Hotel and the one at Narita are worlds apart!!",2016-09-02
1,804,14,"I will never ever stay at Hilton Narita again , service was really at the rock bottom and that was my first Hilton experience they totally ruined it.",2016-09-02
1,804,15,However Hilton Tokyo changed my first impression that I had from Hilton Narita.,2016-09-02
1,804,16,I will definitely stay at Hilton Tokyo in my 5 upcoming trips next year !!,2016-09-02
1,804,17,"Oh and I forgot to mention, the breakfast was amazing!!!",2016-09-02

1,805,7,"The service wasn't friendly, it felt it was more just obligatory.",2016-09-02

1,806,1,Good hotel for room quality (cleaning) and staff courtesy.,2016-09-02
1,806,2,"A good position in Shinjuku, near the main station (about 10 minute by feet) and the metro service is linked directly to the hotel lobby.",2016-09-02
1,806,3,Maybe the quality/price can be improved (for example providing a bottle of water everyday like other hotel chains of the same level).,2016-09-02
1,807,1,I have been visiting Hilton Tokyo regularly for many years.,2016-09-02
1,807,2,Its location at Shinjuku is perhaps the most convenient for business or for leisure.,2016-09-02

1,871,1,"The hotel was truly five star; the rooms were beautiful and very clean, the lounge area and the conference facilities great, the pool and gym also perfect.",2016-07-28
1,871,2,My only comment is that a hotel such as this should have a bar on the top floor as the views of the city would make it a Tokyo highlight.,2016-07-28
1,871,3,"Maybe next time, Hilton people!",2016-07-28
1,872,1,"I don't have a single complaint -- because of my work, I ended up having to do room service quite a bit, not able to get out much -- and everyone who assisted me was beyond helpful!",2016-07-28
1,872,2,Naturally the room service prices were pricey -- this is a 5-star hotel in Tokyo -- I didn't expect anything less to be honest.,2016-07-28
1,872,3,The beds are incredibly comfortable and the bathroom has enough space to get ready in the morning.,2016-07-28
1,872,4,I took the Airport Limousine Bus to & from Narita Airport.,2016-07-28
1,872,5,"On the way there, my flight landed to late to be dropped off at the hotel.",2016-07-28
1,872,6,So I had to go to Shinjuku Station and walk (half a mile maybe?) to the hotel - not too bad.,2016-07-28
1,872,7,But going back to the airport was bliss -- just hop on the bus in front of the hotel and in about 90 mins you are there.,2016-07-28
1,872,8,"If I come back to Tokyo for work, I will definitely stay here again!",2016-07-28
1,873,1,I've stayed at the Tokyo Hilton several times.,2016-07-28

1,873,8,The executive lounge is great for both breakfast & cocktails.,2016-07-28
1,873,9,"Only downside for me is that the gym, while well equipped, is a small room and therefore pretty crowded at prime time.",2016-07-28
1,873,10,"On the other hand, it is open 24 hours a day so maybe try to avoid the morning rush.",2016-07-28
1,874,1,"Dinner buffet was pretty much average, I would've expected a bigger variety of food, as far as types of dishes, flavors and more.",2016-07-27
1,874,2,"The service was very nice and polite, they provided us a very personalized service, but again, I went there to eat and less to be served.",2016-07-27
1,874,3,Deserts was also somewhat disappointing.,2016-07-27
1,874,4,All in all- 3/5.,2016-07-27
1,874,5,Hopefully that by my next visit in October things will improve...,2016-07-27
1,875,1,Stayed at the Hilton Shinjuku Executive floors.,2016-07-26
1,875,2,The service in this hotel is exceptional and great thank you to all the staff for enhancing our experience.,2016-07-26
1,875,3,"Even though this hotel is a bit dated, it is very well maintained and conveniently located.",2016-07-26
1,875,4,There are others who complained it is a bit to walk to the main Shinjuku shopping area.,2016-07-26
1,875,5,But I enjoyed the brisk walk (around 7 mins).,2016-07-26
1,876,1,We stayed 5 nights at Hilton Tokyo in Feb. the hotel and all facilities are fantastic.,2016-07-25
1,876,2,Staff are attentive and very friendly.,2016-07-25

1,876,4,The gym facilities are great and the staff there also brilliant.,2016-07-25
1,876,5,My room and bathroom was spacious and of great standard.,2016-07-25
1,876,6,Location of the hotel is hard to beat.,2016-07-25
1,876,7,Easy walk to downtown and nightclub/restaurant hub.,2016-07-25
1,876,8,They also have an easy to use shuttle service which we used once.,2016-07-25
1,877,1,Stayed at a junior suite at Hilton Tokyo for a family vacation with our two adult-sized teenagers.,2016-07-25
1,877,2,The hotel was chosen mainly due to its central location and the room size that appeared to be sufficient for the four of us.,2016-07-25
1,877,3,The room had a king size bed and we asked for a roll away bed which was twin-size at no extra cost.,2016-07-25
1,877,4,The room also had a modular sofa and was large enough to lay open our four suitcases.,2016-07-25
1,877,5,One slight issue was with the size of the bathroom.,2016-07-25
1,877,6,"There was not much counter space, and I never understood when hotels choose to use a piece of glass that covers less than half the shower instead of a shower curtain or other means to block water.",2016-07-25
1,877,7,The obvious result was the wet bathroom floor.,2016-07-25
1,877,8,"Other than that, it meets all our travel needs.",2016-07-25
1,877,9,There was a convenient store in the basement that opened 24 hours; it was (strangely) a hit for our kids and the items appeared to be regularly priced.,2016-07-25
1,877,10,The hotel is close to Nishi Shinjuku and Tochomae subway stations (short walking distances).,2016-07-25
1,877,11,Shinjuku (different from Nishi Shinjuku) is the main station there and the hotel has free shuttle services every 20 minutes (schedule available in the lobby).,2016-07-25
1,877,12,We walked back from the station once; there was an underground tunnel which became quite confusing for us so it turned out to be a challenge especially after a long day of walking already.,2016-07-25
1,877,13,I therefore recommend the shuttle service which we utilized several times; it was NEVER late which was impressive.,2016-07-25
1,877,14,"In case one wishes to use the shuttle from the Shinjuku station to the hotel for the first time: It stops at Stop 21 (there is a sign) which is between the west and the south exits of the Shinjuku station, in front of the Keio department store.",2016-07-25
1,877,15,The bus has room for luggage.,2016-07-25
1,877,16,"We arrived in Japan via Haneda Airport and didn't have any problems getting Airport Limousine tickets at the airport after getting off the airplane, and Hilton is one of the stops for the Shinjuku line.",2016-07-25
1,877,17,We left from Narita; the Airport Limousine tickets could be purchased at Hilton but the one we wanted to book was sold out the night before.,2016-07-25
1,877,18,We ended up taking the JR Narita Express train which cost almost the same.,2016-07-25
1,877,19,The train leaves from the building across from the south exit of the Shinjuku station.,2016-07-25
1,877,20,It is a shorter ride than the bus but do take into consideration the extra time needed to get from the hotel to the station.,2016-07-25
1,878,1,This Hilton is awesome.,2016-07-25
1,878,2,Spent 4 nights here with my sister.,2016-07-25
1,878,3,She loves it too.,2016-07-25

1,910,10,Japanese hotels tend to set the air con at 24 Celsius or so and therefore it was refreshing to have a hotel that does not reset to the higher temperature and that also can blast truly cold air con.,2016-07-11
1,910,11,The window had a sliding shoji screen type covering as well as full sliding wall type covering to block out both the light and heat of the sun.,2016-07-11
1,910,12,"While there was lots of room in the hotel room and a nice chair in the corner, what was missing was a little side table or something on which one could rest a drink or some snacks while sitting back to watch TV.",2016-07-11

1,910,16,"They fixed it twice but each time, it only worked once before being locked and unable to be opened again.",2016-07-11
1,910,17,I think language was a problem with some staff except the concierge and front desk staff as the person sent to fix my in room safe indicated in broken language after fixing the safe that it was not reliable to use and then carried in a smaller portable safe that weighed maybe 15 lbs or so which he suggested I use instead.,2016-07-11
1,910,18,"I then went to reception and explained to a very helpful Mr. Hiroyuki Ohashi, the front desk shift leader for the evening, the humour of leaving me a portable safe and, notwithstanding I said it was no longer important as I had only one more night to stay at the hotel, Mr. Ohashi very efficiently arranged for the safe to be fixed properly on the third try and in addition advised the Executive Housekeeper Takao Kuroda who left me a very nice letter apologizing for the problems with the safe and also complimentary wine and chocolates.",2016-07-11

1,910,21,The breakfast restaurant can be very busy on the weekend with a bit of waiting to be seated even at around 8 am in the morning.,2016-07-11
1,910,22,"A bit disappointed though the coffee tends to be American Starbucks strong and bitter but without much taste, as generally Tokyo restaurants and hotels serve really good tasting coffee as the Japanese are pickier and willing to pay more for coffee beans than other nations.",2016-07-11
1,910,23,Clientele is very international at the Hilton Tokyo with lots of business people but also lots of families and international vacationers.,2016-07-11
1,910,24,The hotels seems very busy at all times and seems quite full.,2016-07-11
1,910,25,Overall a good hotel with great facilities but a bit far in terms of walking distance to Shinjuku station if you are more of a leisure traveller rather than business traveller.,2016-07-11

1,961,2,"While the hotel is a big property, we never felt like it was impersonal and to the contrary, we were given great personal attention both by the front desk and staff at the concierge and executive level.",2016-06-16
1,961,3,We were able to upgrade to an executive level room with access to the lounge.,2016-06-16
1,961,4,The personnel within the lounge were extremely friendly.,2016-06-16
1,961,5,"We were able to eat breakfast at the lounge on a daily basis, as well as grab snacks and drinks in the afternoon/evening.",2016-06-16
1,961,6,Getting access to the lounge is a great benefit to staying at the hotel and the staff make you feel special.,2016-06-16

1,962,3,"Our room was beautiful, very clean and modern.",2016-06-14
1,962,4,The breakfast was better on the first floor as less noisy and busy than the foyer.,2016-06-14
1,962,5,"The best bit was the executive lounge access as part of the room, quite a feast in the evening and a spectacular view of Mount Fuji.",2016-06-14
1,963,1,As a HH member for more then ten years I´ve stayed at lots of Hilton hotels all over the World.,2016-06-14
1,963,2,Some disapointing (mostly US hotels) and some over expactations.,2016-06-14
1,963,3,Checking in at Tokyo Hilton for the first time with it´s 803 rooms I had no special expectations.,2016-06-14

1,963,5,Special thanks to Haruna Yoshimi and all her lounge staff.,2016-06-14
1,963,6,Best lounge and treatment we ever had.,2016-06-14
1,963,7,So all in all my wife and I agreed upon that this is the very best Hilton that we ever stayed at.,2016-06-14
1,964,1,This hotel is top notch.,2016-06-12
1,964,2,I've stayed in a lot of nice hotels and the only one that compares in my book was the Pallazo in Vegas.,2016-06-12
1,964,3,This staff was great in Tokyo.,2016-06-12
1,964,4,Special accommodations for my family were made and greatly appreciated!,2016-06-12
1,965,1,It took me a bit to write about this great hotel with a great location and superb employees but unfortunately they have completed downgraded their services and amenities in the Executive Lounge.,2016-06-11
1,965,2,This hotel used to have the best service and the best food and drinks in any Hilton worldwide that I've ever visited.,2016-06-11
1,965,3,"Nowadays, even though it's in the same location their happy hour has gone from having a bartender making the finest cocktails to as low as get your own beer or wine or make yourself your own drink with the few limited bottles they have displayed.",2016-06-11
1,965,4,"Food wise they had the best food during happy hour with great sushi, exquisite rice, fine beef, great chicken or awesome seafood to mostly cold finger food nicely decorated but of the lowest quality.",2016-06-11
1,965,5,It is certainly disappointing for loyal HHonors members and for the guests that pay the outrageously high rates for an executive room.,2016-06-11
1,965,6,I never saw this coming from this lounge in Tokyo.,2016-06-11
1,965,7,"Nevertheless, the hotel maintains its great customer service and great food at their restaurant.",2016-06-11
1,965,8,"I still recommend this awesome hotel but will discourage people to pay executive room rates unless you don't mind the downgrade of drinks, food and services in the lounge.",2016-06-11
1,966,1,Had a recent three night stay.,2016-06-11
1,966,2,Booked a junior suite and was upgraded to an executive suite.,2016-06-11
1,966,3,"Room was nice and spacious, but a very small bathroom.",2016-06-11
1,966,4,Closet area near entrance was also very dark (inadequate lighting).,2016-06-11
1,966,5,As an executive level guest you can have breakfast in the lounge or from a selection of the two main restaurants.,2016-06-11
1,966,6,I preferred the second floor restaurant as it had a slightly larger selection of Japanese food for breakfast and was more quiet.,2016-06-11
1,966,7,Proficient service and decent facilities.,2016-06-11
1,966,8,The building is older so the ceilings are lower in the rooms.,2016-06-11
1,966,9,Location is fairly convenient but also extremely quiet as it is a bit of a walk from the main Shinjuku station.,2016-06-11
1,966,10,"Small fitness center which was well maintained, I think there is also an additional annex with more space to exercise.",2016-06-11
1,966,11,It is a large hotel with a convention atmosphere almost.,2016-06-11
1,966,12,"I don't think you could go wrong with this hotel, though it is not a luxury hotel.",2016-06-11
1,967,1,This was my first trip to Tokyo and Japan so I decided to stay at the Hilton based on reviews and previous experiences with other Hiltons.,2016-06-11
1,967,2,I enjoyed my stay but think I might try another hotel next time.,2016-06-11
1,967,3,It is nice but I felt it was missing something that would make you rave about it.,2016-06-11
1,967,4,Pros- ,2016-06-11
1,967,5,Location,2016-06-11

1,967,12,Cons-,2016-06-11
1,967,13,The foyer has hardly any seating so if you are waiting for the shuttle or friends good luck getting a seat,2016-06-11
1,967,14,"The concierge weren't overly friendly or maybe I was just unlucky, you also had to wait quite a but as there was often only 1 or 2 working at the desk",2016-06-11
1,967,15,"Toiletries in the room weren't very nice, not a major thing but considering the price they could do better",2016-06-11
1,967,16,"The beds are not as nice as the ones at other Hiltons, I found it really too firm!",2016-06-11
1,967,17,I stayed in a king deluxe room for 7 nights,2016-06-11
1,968,1,"This review is focused on the Concierge desk and the help provided by their Chief Concierge, Mr. Keisuke Sakamoto.",2016-06-10
1,968,2,One of our group did not know that he had a strong allergy to buck wheat found in soba noodles.,2016-06-10
1,968,3,"Two bites of soba and additional bites of udon noodles had him swelling up in hives all over his body and constriction of his airway, although not immediately life threatening but was headed in that direction.",2016-06-10
1,968,4,What does one do in a foreign country where one does not speak Japanese?,2016-06-10
1,968,5,Call the concierge desk and seek help.,2016-06-10
1,968,6,"Mr. Sakamoto who spoke English acted as our interpreter ensuring the sense of medical urgency, medical questions and clarity of the situation was understood by the hospital emergency room staff who did not speak English very well.",2016-06-10
1,968,7,"He was patient, understanding, compassionate yet firm when the patient's health was discussed.",2016-06-10
1,968,8,He directed us to the nearest emergency room and accompanied us.,2016-06-10
1,968,9,He stayed with my daughter's boyfriend well beyond his working shift to ensure that he was being properly treated and was on the road to recovery.,2016-06-10
1,968,10,Before he left he made sure we knew the status of his condition and what was being done for him.,2016-06-10
1,968,11,The next day he offered to help us get his medical records from the hospital that would help our him get partial reimbursement from his medical plan when he returned home.,2016-06-10
1,968,12,Such service and the depth of the concierge staff coverage that would allow the Chief Concierge to stay with us while his staff took care of anything else that came up at the hotel shows you how Hilton trains and develops their staff to be able to address situations such as this without skipping a beat.,2016-06-10
1,968,13,The personal service provided by Mr. Sakamoto was above and beyond the call of his duty at the Hilton or reflects the value the Hilton has for their guests.,2016-06-10
1,968,14,"Overall the service from the Hilton was extraordinary, they anticipated our needs before we could express them and that was from everyone from the front desk, bell desk, concierge, executive lounge, housekeeping.",2016-06-10
1,968,15,Some of them remembered our names after our first encounter.,2016-06-10
1,968,16,One of the best things we like was the Executive Lounge on the 37th floor.,2016-06-10
1,968,17,The spacious arrangements and quaint tables with a breakfast spread that included both Japanese dishes as well as American.,2016-06-10
1,968,18,Dinner was the same and delicious.,2016-06-10
1,968,19,All was included in the Executive benefits.,2016-06-10
1,968,20,The bathroom was Japanese designed with a deep bathtub and an area where you could shower separately before sinking into the hot waters of the bathtub.,2016-06-10
1,968,21,Aaahhhhh!!!!!,2016-06-10
1,968,22,"One thing I would recommend is to include a small stool so that you could take a shower sitting down, prevents the chance of slipping on the soap suds on the floor.",2016-06-10
1,968,23,Inclusion of the small stool would make the bathroom more of an Onsen - traditional setup.,2016-06-10
1,968,24,We appreciated the two complimentary bottles of water Hilton provided each day we were there.,2016-06-10
1,968,25,They came in handy when you are out discovering Tokyo.,2016-06-10
1,969,1,"Excellent hotel, always favorite and place to stay for me while in Tokyo for business.",2016-06-10
1,969,2,Located just small walk away from Shinjuku station.,2016-06-10

1,971,1,The Hilton is situated in a quiet area not too far from Shinjuku station.,2016-06-08
1,971,2,"A regular free shuttle bus service operates between the hotel and Shinjuku station (the bus stop is outside the Keio department store), which is very convenient and was well utilised during our stay.",2016-06-08

1,971,4,"The hotel room itself was clean, comfortable and a decent size by Japan standards.",2016-06-08
1,971,5,"Noise was not an issue during our stay nor was light shining through the windows first thing in the morning, which allowed for us to get a decent sleep.",2016-06-08
1,971,6,"Free wifi is provided if you are a member of the Hilton's HHonors loyalty scheme, otherwise you need to pay.",2016-06-08
1,971,7,"However, you can sign up for this free of charge on arrival and get instant wifi connectivity, which was really good and worked well.",2016-06-08
1,971,8,"The hotel offers an airport shuttle bus service at an additional cost, which although a convenient means of getting to the airport, the first 40 minutes of the journey is spent collecting additional passengers around central Tokyo.",2016-06-08
1,971,9,"Even though the hotel requests reservations for this service to be made 3 days in advance, they were kind enough to let us make a reservation only 1 day before our departure date.",2016-06-08
1,971,10,We did not use any of the other facilities at this hotel so cannot comment.,2016-06-08
1,971,11,"The staff were really helpful and friendly, particularly one of the girls at the concierge (Sophie) who went above and beyond her normal duties to help us with our coach trip to Kawaguchiko.",2016-06-08
1,971,12,Cannot praise them enough for their excellent service!,2016-06-08
1,971,13,Thank you!,2016-06-08
1,972,1,We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Tokyo and visited the Hilton a couple of times during our stay and the atmosphere and food were pretty amazing!,2016-06-03
1,972,2,"As someone who doesn't really enjoy breakfast as much as one should, I was actually pretty happy with the service offered by the staff as well as the variety of their breakfast service.",2016-06-03
1,972,3,I've never been to a hotel that offered such a variety of foods.,2016-06-03
1,972,4,You have the option of enjoying food from outside of Japan or enjoying a traditional Japanese breakfast.,2016-06-03
1,972,5,The fact that they can appeal to just about everyone (even us folk who don't appreciate breakfast as much as we should) gains my respect.,2016-06-03
1,972,6,I like being able to enjoy fresh smoothies with my meals and even detox water.,2016-06-03
1,972,7,They offer about 4 different kinds of milk; banana milk included (recommend trying it!) ,2016-06-03
1,972,8,They have an egg station where you can get yourself anything from an omlette to a simple hard boiled egg.,2016-06-03
1,972,9,The cold cuts and cheese was a great spot for those who want to either kick up an appetite or keep it light.,2016-06-03
1,972,10,It's great that they have it set up next to the fruit with humidifiers so they food doesn't dry out and get gross.,2016-06-03
1,972,11,I thought that being in Japan it would be hard to fjnd some good food that reminded me of home but when I tried their french toast and hash browns I have to say that they far exceed what I've had back in Canada.,2016-06-03
1,972,12,Everything just seems to be on point.,2016-06-03
1,972,13,"Despite being from another hotel, the staff were very kind to us and made us feel welcome.",2016-06-03
1,972,14,I overheard a young boy asking whom I believe was the manager if they had hot chocolate and he promptly set off to find some for him.,2016-06-03
1,972,15,That is someone dedicated to customer service and it's the little things when you see how happy the patrons are.,2016-06-03

1,972,18,Bravo!,2016-06-03
1,973,1,Had a couple of days at the Hilton as a base for doing the tourist bit of Tokyo -the location in Shinjuku served my needs very well especially as it seemed to offer more variety on the doorstep in the evenings -lots of shops and restaurants etc....as well as its proximity to a major railway/metro hub.,2016-06-02
1,973,2,"The junior suite was looking a bit dated and tired and the bathroom was the smallest I have experienced on my travels for a long time -needless to say it would have been nicer to have got a refurbished room, maybe better luck next time?!",2016-06-02
1,973,3,The bar on the 2nd floor was quite lively when I attended and the food outlets on the same floor all looked very appealing but I decided to eat out and enjoy some local food and atmosphere.,2016-06-02
1,973,4,Overall its a good non descript functional chain hotel that does what it says on the tin and on this occasion that is what I was after.....,2016-06-02
1,974,1,This is my second visit to the Hilton Tokyo.,2016-06-02
1,974,2,"It's tucked away from Shinjuku station in a quiet area close to a very nice park, near restaurants.",2016-06-02
1,974,3,We upgraded to a suite which was large for Tokyo standards.,2016-06-02
1,974,4,The amenities were excellent.,2016-06-02
1,974,5,We had a problem with noise though.,2016-06-02
1,974,6,It seems either the walls are paper thin or the ceilings are because for our five night stay - during two nights we heard non-stop stomping above us.,2016-06-02
1,974,7,Finally after the second night the hotel manager moved us to the top floor which eliminated the stomping above us.,2016-06-02
1,974,8,"The hotel goes the extra mile as it acknowledged our anniversary with wine, chocolates and cookies and when we had to move rooms they gave us more chocolates.",2016-06-02
1,974,9,We ate dinner at the Metropolitan Grill and the price for two was close to $400 Canadian so not cheap!,2016-06-02
1,974,10,The food was good of course.,2016-06-02
1,974,11,As tip...there are great restaurants down the street at Shinjuku Island Tower.,2016-06-02
1,974,12,Overall a quality hotel.,2016-06-02
1,975,1,We stayed at the Hilton Tokyo for 8 nights in May 2016 with out two young children (3 years old and 7 months old).,2016-06-02
1,975,2,We had interconnecting rooms on the 17th floor which were superb.,2016-06-02
1,975,3,The room with a King sized bed had a lovely bathroom combing western and Japanese influences.,2016-06-02
1,975,4,The screens on the windows were a nice Japanese touch too.,2016-06-02
1,975,5,The buffet breakfast in the Marble Lounge is good but at peak hour we were seated in the smoke-smelling adjoining bar.,2016-06-02
1,975,6,The lack of proper highchairs for babies and toddlers in the Marble Lounge was frustrating given they are at other restaurants.,2016-06-02
1,975,7,Our flight home was delayed 9 hours.,2016-06-02
1,975,8,They staff were accommodating and extended our checkout free of charge.,2016-06-02

1,976,4,The view was great and the big windows made the rooms even more spacious.,2016-06-01
1,976,5,"My only complaints about the room would be that there was no Nespresso Machine, which is what we are used to when we book hotel rooms.",2016-06-01
1,976,6,"Considering they called it a suite, it could use a Nespresso Machine.",2016-06-01
1,976,7,"Also, the shower was not built well that every time we would shower, the outside area would flood, and the water would go into the toilet stall.",2016-06-01
1,976,8,"We would order room service quite a bit for the kids, and I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it.",2016-06-01
1,976,9,"Desserts were excellent, and room service was quick and efficient, and the food pretty good.",2016-06-01
1,976,10,"Buffet breakfast could use a bit of sprucing up, as the three mornings we had breakfast there, all hot foot remained the same.",2016-06-01
1,976,11,It could use a bit of variety.,2016-06-01
1,976,12,"However, the wait staff was absolutely wonderful and took care of the kids and entertained them!",2016-06-01
1,976,13,"Excellent, excellent service!",2016-06-01

1,976,16,"We explored all options together, and they called several mini van rental services to find us a mini van.",2016-06-01

1,977,1,"With a good room size, silent windows and nice views over Shinjuku, Hilton Tokyo is a good place to stay.",2016-06-01
1,977,2,The bar is eclectic and the DJ plays nice music while the bartenders expertly serve you various cocktails and Hibiki on ice ,2016-06-01
1,977,3,The breakfast served is lavish and has few options for veggies.,2016-06-01

1,977,8,There are some more eating options in the mall next door.,2016-06-01
1,977,9,A good place to stay if you want to work in central Tokyo or Shinjuku itself but far if u want to go to Big Sight expo centre (I had to) ,2016-06-01
1,977,10,"In any case, the Hilton is a nice place to stay and enjoy the good life!",2016-06-01
1,978,1,We enjoyed our stay at the Tokyo Hilton.,2016-05-31
1,978,2,Location wise it is not as close to the area of Shinjuku we hoped to frequent just by walking -- in January of 2015 we stayed at the Century Southern Hotel and location wise it was much preferable.,2016-05-31
1,978,3,"That being said, for the Hilton stay it was May and VERY close to a subway station.",2016-05-31

1,1023,10,They tried this bait and switch again on me during my last trip there as well but when the front desk lady gave me the key card and informed me of the upgrade I told her I only want it if the room is a king size non-smoking...then she said no it's two small beds.,2016-05-10
1,1023,11,"Then I had to wait while she ""downgraded me"" and talked to management about finding a king size bed.",2016-05-10

1,1204,7,Considering that most of the guests are international (including many Airline Crews) the spoken English of the front desk staff should be better.,2016-01-26
1,1204,8,"They did have a Spanish native speaker, which must have been a help to their Spanish speaking guests.",2016-01-26

1,1212,4,"The location, a couple of minutes walk to either the ""M"" or ""E"" lines, plus the JR a little further up the road, makes for getting around Tokyo very easily.",2016-01-18

1,1213,11,Eating in the hotel was good but quite expensive.,2016-01-17

1,1222,43,It is a few simple clicks of a mouse but they were unwilling and/or reluctant to help me.,2016-01-10
1,1222,44,We dined at the hotel's Japanese restaurant one evening.,2016-01-10
1,1222,45,I would not recommend the restaurant.,2016-01-10
1,1222,46,The sushi was overpriced and mediocre quality.,2016-01-10
1,1222,47,"Overall, the hotel was clean, comfortable, modern and in a good location - but that is all.",2016-01-10
1,1222,48,The service was poor and not up to Hilton standard.,2016-01-10
1,1222,49,"The staff were cold, indifferent and unwilling to help.",2016-01-10
1,1222,50,"On this basis, I definitely would not recommend Hilton Tokyo.",2016-01-10
1,1222,51,"The Shinjuku area, while convenient and lively, is not the most upmarket area.",2016-01-10
1,1222,52,"Next time, I would stay in Ginza or Rappongi - and definitely with a different hotel chain.",2016-01-10
1,1223,1,The service at the Hilton Tokyo was excellent and the staff were well mannered.,2016-01-10
1,1223,2,The room we stayed in could do with a renovation as it looked a little tired and the bathrooms are out-dated.,2016-01-10
1,1223,3,Breakfast was well appointed and we had the option of multiple dining areas.,2016-01-10
1,1223,4,The facilities available were very good.,2016-01-10
1,1224,1,During booking I selected an option to upgrade to an executive room if available on checkin.,2016-01-09
1,1224,2,"While checking in I was told the upgrade is accepted and my wife and I would have an executive room for an extra approx 10,000 yen per night.",2016-01-09
1,1224,3,However as we were doing the paperwork the two different people checking in on either side of me were also offered the same upgrade to an executive room but for free.,2016-01-09
1,1224,4,"I asked why it was free for them but around 10,000 yen a night for me and was told the difference was that I had selected the upgrade option when booking and they hadn't.",2016-01-09
1,1224,5,"So because I ticked a box on my booking I had to pay 10,000 yen/night while the two other groups got the same thing for free...",2016-01-09
1,1224,6,I therefore told the lady I didn't think I was really getting very good value for that and I would just stick with the original room I booked (I didn't want the upgrade).,2016-01-09
1,1224,7,I was then told that was too late I couldn't have my original room because they had already made up the upgraded room for me.,2016-01-09
1,1224,8,I was then asked to go to the lounge and wait because they were just waiting for people to leave my room so they could make it up.,2016-01-09
1,1224,9,I then queried why it was too late to go back to my original booking then if the upgraded room wasn't actually made up as they had originally claimed.,2016-01-09
1,1224,10,"Finally after checking with the manager it was ok they agreed to let me have the original type of room I booked - and not have to pay an additional 10,000 yen/night for an upgrade I didn't want.",2016-01-09
1,1224,11,After the fun of checkin I thought id let off some frustration by playing a game of tennis.,2016-01-09
1,1224,12,"On trying to book the court I was told there is a court booking fee, a racket hiring fee, and the best part was a fee of 900 yen if I wanted to borrow a tennis ball (4).",2016-01-09
1,1224,13,Really Hilton if you are advertising features like a tennis court as amenities on your website is it too much to ask to borrow a few tennis balls to play tennis!,2016-01-09
1,1224,14,"You pay a premium to stay in a 5 star hotel such as this, it's a shame that the service and the inclusions don't match the high price.",2016-01-09
1,1224,15,For the cost there are better alternatives.,2016-01-09
1,1225,1,This is the best Hilton I have experienced.,2016-01-09
1,1225,2,"The place is beautiful, the staff are wonderful and the room is clean, large and comfortable.",2016-01-09
1,1225,3,Wifi was good speed.,2016-01-09
1,1225,4,"Did not try food options, but there is a local fm food court close for the cheaper options.",2016-01-09
1,1226,1,Great spot only 10 min walk to Shinjuku station and the free shuttle bus to the station is so handy.,2016-01-08
1,1226,2,All staff were super friendly and the room was roomy clean and great view.,2016-01-08
1,1226,3,Only downside was the expensive food and drinks but other than that would def stay again,2016-01-08
1,1227,1,Stayed in the hotel with my husband and friends in May 2015.,2016-01-07
1,1227,2,Loved the hotel and love Tokyo!,2016-01-07
1,1227,3,I normally don't like such large hotels but this one is the exception for sure.,2016-01-07
1,1227,4,"The rooms were great, restaurants excellent and of great variety, cleaning and staff very helpful and professional.",2016-01-07
1,1227,5,We experienced a very large earthquake (7.8) while staying in the hotel and the level of professionalism by hotel staff in the situation was incredible.,2016-01-07
1,1227,6,I would stay here again for sure and recommend it anyone and everyone.,2016-01-07
1,1228,1,I don't typically go for giant hotels (500+ rooms) but the location and price of this was too good to turn down on my first time in Tokyo.,2016-01-07
1,1228,2,"It has over 800 rooms, a lot of restaurants, bars, shopping, spa, pool, fitness rooms, etc but they do a nice job of making sure that the crowds don't add up to long wait times.",2016-01-07
1,1228,3,"Service is friendly, helpful and efficient.",2016-01-07
1,1228,4,The room was surprisingly spacious and since we were on the 33rd floor we had a pretty amazing view of Shinkjuku.,2016-01-07
1,1228,5,"You can walk to many attractions in the area, and it is centrally located to many transport hubs.",2016-01-07
1,1228,6,I thought this was a good hotel for business travelers and travelers new to Tokyo.,2016-01-07
1,1229,1,I stayed here in January 2016 with my husband and 2 kids aged 11 & 14.,2016-01-06
1,1229,2,The hotel is reasonably well located...only 10 mins walk to the Shinjuku Station or a complimentary bus runs regularly to take you there.,2016-01-06
1,1229,3,The room was fine.,2016-01-06
1,1229,4,All four of us were in one room with the kids on rollaways which was fine for 2 nights.,2016-01-06
1,1229,5,We were surprised and disappointed that movies on demand were not available.,2016-01-06
1,1229,6,Other hotels in Tokyo that we had stayed at offered the ability to buy english movies which is helpful when the kids are tired after a long day.,2016-01-06
1,1229,7,The restaurants looked good but were very expensive so we decided not to eat at them.,2016-01-06
1,1229,8,"We ate dinner nearby at a Japanese restaurant ""Hokkaido"" recommended by the concierge.",2016-01-06
1,1229,9,We ate breakfast at the Hilton buffet which was around the expected price for a hotel buffet and fine.,2016-01-06
1,1229,10,The indoor pool is small and was too crowded when the kids went to go for a swim.,2016-01-06
1,1229,11,Wifi is included but restricted to 2 devices at a time which seems a bit outdated for an international hotel chain.,2016-01-06
1,1229,12,The concierge and staff were helpful.,2016-01-06
1,1229,13,Overall I would recommend this hotel.,2016-01-06
1,1230,1,Let me start by saying how AMAZING Japan is!,2016-01-06
1,1230,2,Everything from the people to the cuisine is phenomenal.,2016-01-06
1,1230,3,"Nowhere else (and we’ve traveled quite a bit) are people more hospitable, kind, organized and civilized.",2016-01-06
1,1230,4,"In fact, every country should strive to be more like Japan!",2016-01-06
1,1230,5,Unfortunately our stay at the Hilton wasn’t as great.,2016-01-06
1,1230,6,"We checked in on January 1st and the hotel lobby was a complete MAD house, granted it was January 1st but the crowds were ridiculous.",2016-01-06
1,1230,7,"Already a little hesitant due to the amount of traffic at the hotel, we moved on in the hopes our room would be worth the crowds, especially after being told we had been “upgraded” since we are Hilton Diamond members.",2016-01-06
1,1230,8,"Our so-called “upgrade” was simply getting a room on the executive floor, nothing more.",2016-01-06
1,1230,9,"The actual room (booked using Hilton honor points at a whopping 50,000 points a night) was EXTREMELY small…so small that my medium sized suitcase blocked the door when I laid it on the pre fabricated mounted wall suit case shelf (serious design flaw).",2016-01-06
1,1230,10,The other suite case had to be tucked underneath the television because there was absolutely nowhere else to put it.,2016-01-06
1,1230,11,"The bathroom was outdated and the bathtub had several hairs in it, the AC wasn’t working very well and throughout the night we heard people coughing and walking across the hallway.",2016-01-06
1,1230,12,The room did have a great view of Mount Fuji but I can’t get over how small the room was…,2016-01-06
1,1230,13,"That same night, we headed to the executive lounge for some cocktails in an effort to cheer us up and again we were met by an absurd amount of people, the crowd was so large that folks were lining up outside of the lounge.",2016-01-06
1,1230,14,Never have I ever witnessed such a crowd in an executive lounge.,2016-01-06
1,1230,15,I would highly suggest the hotel invests in a larger lounge if non-Gold and Diamond members are authorized to use the lounge through certain room packages/deals.,2016-01-06
1,1230,16,"The following morning, after a dreadful night, we contacted the front desk and after explaining everything they quickly upgraded us to a suite acknowledging that the so-called “upgrade” wasn’t really an upgrade that they had simply put us on the executive floor…the suite was gorgeous and we were very grateful for the upgrade!",2016-01-06
1,1230,17,"Sadly my ordeal wasn’t over yet however, this time it involved the concierge desk.",2016-01-06
1,1230,18,"That evening, as a result of inaccurate directions, I spent 60 minutes (and $30 on a taxi) searching for a restaurant on a map printed out by the concierge folks that didn’t exist at the address provided.",2016-01-06
1,1230,19,Several neighborhood residents were kind enough to walk me to the address listed on the map but each time we ended up at the same apartment building (no sign of a Japanese restaurant).,2016-01-06
1,1230,20,"Eventually I stopped searching for the restaurant, hopped on the metro and had a quick ramen meal.",2016-01-06
1,1230,21,"Ironically enough, while I received directions and a map from the concierge desk (before departing for the restaurant with a reservation), an older gentleman stormed into the hotel and demanded the concierge desk contact a manager ASAP.",2016-01-06
1,1230,22,It seems that he had been provided (by the concierge desk) incorrect directions.,2016-01-06
1,1230,23,"Right before I stepped away from the desk, he stopped me and forewarned me about his ordeal, little did I know the same would happen to me!",2016-01-06
1,1230,24,During my check out I was hoping someone would ask me how my stay was but no one did hence my review on trip advisor.,2016-01-06
1,1230,25,"As a diamond member, I would have expected a lot more.",2016-01-06
1,1230,26,"The only reason this property is getting three stars is because of how amazing the Japanese people are and how pleasant it was to deal with them on a daily basis, though I must admit some folks at this Hilton are clearly “burnt out” from dealing with tourists (I don’t blame them).",2016-01-06
1,1230,27,My overall advice is to book your stay somewhere else if you want a more personal and intimate experience.,2016-01-06
1,1230,28,This property is a tourist black hole with a lot of traffic.,2016-01-06
1,1230,29,"As a diamond member I would have expected a lot more…Hilton, you can do better than this!",2016-01-06
1,1231,1,We got an amazing room with a view of Mount Fuji on the horizon.,2016-01-06
1,1231,2,"Expert service, very clean, modern and still cozy.",2016-01-06
1,1231,3,"Only downside was there were no restaurant in the hotel that served any vegetarian food, we found an indian restaurant in the ""basement"", it was good food but quite shabby, not connected to the hotel though.",2016-01-06
1,1232,1,The front desk and concerige were really helpful and the service was very efficient at the Tokyo Hilton.English as a second language was not a problem and the food on the club floor was very nice indeed.The location was good as beneath the hotel there were arcades with lovely shops and resturants.,2016-01-05
1,1233,1,We stayed at Hilton for 2 nights.,2016-01-05
1,1233,2,Our flight landed in Tokyo early so we tried to check in early and the staff tried to upsell the executive room to us.,2016-01-05
1,1233,3,He wasnt pushy with the sale but it felt impersonal.,2016-01-05
1,1233,4,"Although it is 5 star hotel and the staff are competant and polite, the hotel made us feel like just another number.",2016-01-05
1,1233,5,There was no personalised service and the experience left us feeling a bit flat and cold.,2016-01-05
1,1233,6,"The room was tastefully decorated and had a nice view of the city, but there was no soundproofing.",2016-01-05
1,1233,7,You could hear the kids runnings in the hallways and talking in other rooms.,2016-01-05
1,1233,8,This contributed to a great lack of sleep.,2016-01-05
1,1233,9,"The hotel kindly organised xmas card, chocolates and wine, the gifts seemed to be generic and without care.",2016-01-05
1,1233,10,The card was also printed out poorly with lines across the sentences showing the printer was running out of ink.,2016-01-05
1,1233,11,Again this reinforces that there was no personalised touch which is something that is expected when staying in a 5 star hotel.,2016-01-05
1,1233,12,"In the end, we didnt feel valued and will not be returning.",2016-01-05
1,1234,1,"The hotel is very nice, with polite and friendly staff as any other Hiltons.",2016-01-05
1,1234,2,"The executive lounge at 37th floor is in the average level in terms of food, I mean, I know better Hilton lounges.",2016-01-05
1,1234,3,But the lounge offers a good view over the streets and surrounding buildings.,2016-01-05
1,1234,4,"The breakfast on the ground floor offers a larger choice of beverages and food than in the lounge, but if you go late, there will be a lot of people.",2016-01-05
1,1234,5,"There is a shuttle bus service every 20 minutes to and from Shinjuku station, which is one of the biggest stations in Tokyo.",2016-01-05
1,1234,6,"So, you will find department stores.",2016-01-05
1,1234,7,"There are also multi-media stores like Biccamera and Yodobashi camera, where you can buy digital cameras, computers, as well as all kinds of peripheral equipment.",2016-01-05
1,1234,8,The only issue is that there are a very limited number of seats in the lobby.,2016-01-05
1,1234,9,"So, for instance, if you decide to take a Limousin bus to go to an airport, you will probably have to wait standing.",2016-01-05
1,1234,10,"A part from that, it is a nice hotel.",2016-01-05
1,1235,1,We stayed at this Hilton twice during our trip to Japan.,2016-01-03
1,1235,2,Once for 3 nights at the beginning and came back for the last 3 nights at the end.,2016-01-03
1,1235,3,"Upon our return, it felt like a ""welcome home""/ This hotel is great and the location and shuttle service are perfect.",2016-01-03
1,1235,4,The concierge desk was very helpful.,2016-01-03
1,1235,5,Breakfast was elaborate and the kids just loved it.,2016-01-03
1,1235,6,The service in the marble lounge was outstanding and the waiters were so friendly and eager to please.,2016-01-03
1,1235,7,"I would like to give a special mention to Hiroaki Shimamune, who really knows customer service and is a major asset to the hotel.",2016-01-03
1,1236,1,Stayed here for a week in February 2015 - the staff is very friendly and helpful and speak good English.,2016-01-03
1,1236,2,"This hotel is in a quiet part of Shinjuku - but only a short walk to Nishi-Shinjuku station and there's also a free shuttle to the very big and busy Shinkjuku station, where you can find a ride to anywhere in Japan......the onsite restaurant and bar were also fantastic with the bar having live music on the weekend evenings and the restaurant having both traditional Japanese and Western style food.",2016-01-03
1,1237,1,Premium hotel that lives up to expectations.Chosen to provide a happy space to rest while visiting Tokyo as a part of Japan trip.,2016-01-03
1,1237,2,No complaints about anything (and I have very high expectations for this level of hotel).,2016-01-03
1,1238,1,Stayed here with my family.,2016-01-03
1,1238,2,Firstly they provide a regular shuttle to Shinjuku station which was handy because we took the train from Narita.,2016-01-03
1,1238,3,Their shuttle is very regular and runs till late.,2016-01-03
1,1238,4,The check in was smooth and no hassles at all.,2016-01-03
1,1238,5,The lobby does get very crowded and not much space for all the tourists they get.,2016-01-03
1,1238,6,"the rooms are big for Toyko standards, and beds are very comfortable.",2016-01-03
1,1238,7,"The hotel does have the 5-star feel to it, and lives up to the Hilton brand name.",2016-01-03
1,1238,8,"There are not much food options around the hotel, so best to take the shuttle to Shinjuku for food.",2016-01-03
1,1238,9,"It is also within walking distance there, about 15 minutes walk.",2016-01-03
1,1238,10,There is a basement walkway to a Metro station which is also very convenient.,2016-01-03
1,1238,11,The walk to that is about 5 minutes.,2016-01-03
1,1238,12,"This station is one which you cannot use JR pass, but it is not expensive.",2016-01-03
1,1238,13,There is a mini mart in the basement too which sells snacks and drinks including beers.,2016-01-03
1,1239,1,This was my 5th stay at this hotel in about 15 years.,2016-01-02
1,1239,2,Services in this hotel are OK.,2016-01-02
1,1239,3,"Compared to many other hotels I stayed in Japan over the years , I must say this is at least now somewhat inferior.",2016-01-02
1,1239,4,I assume handling so many stayers at the same time must be a quite difficult task .,2016-01-02
1,1239,5,Even the excelence of japanese services can't resist the massive numbers Tokyo Hilton have hosted this last week .,2016-01-02
1,1239,6,"For instance, I had to request by phone on occasions additional toilletries .",2016-01-02
1,1239,7,It either took the hotel too long to respond or it did not respond at all .,2016-01-02
1,1239,8,One other time phone communication services was just unavailable .,2016-01-02
1,1239,9,"Also , this Hotel needs a lift-up in most areas.",2016-01-02
1,1239,10,Lobby look small and has a strange staircase that occupies too much space for no clear purpose.,2016-01-02
1,1239,11,"The executive lounge needs also restauration but here services, on the contrary, are absolutely wonderfull and I think this is one of the stongest points of this Hotel.",2016-01-02
1,1239,12,"After all, we had a great stay , thanks to the priviledge of having access to the Lounge!",2016-01-02
1,1240,1,Nice location but not central / good for my preferences.,2016-01-02
1,1240,2,The employees are friendly but rhe English is in general a big limitation.,2016-01-02
1,1240,3,Bar tender needs to be more focus.,2016-01-02
1,1240,4,Very expensive for the sevice and food delivered.,2016-01-02
1,1241,1,Having stayed at hotels around the same area as Hilton Tokyo in Shinjuku made me like this hotel even more.,2016-01-02
1,1241,2,"The Hilton experience begins with check-in, the staff warmly greeted you and welcomed you back to the hotel, just like welcoming you home.",2016-01-02
1,1241,3,"The whole process was a speedy one, as if they had prepared to receive you upon your arrival.",2016-01-02

1,1241,6,The restaurant serving breakfast was a very busy one.,2016-01-02
1,1241,7,Expect to have crowds in the morning.,2016-01-02
1,1241,8,"Despite that, there was no shortfall in service.",2016-01-02

1,1241,10,The service was swift and efficient.,2016-01-02
1,1241,11,"The breakfast selection was excellent and the selection of bread was tempting, it was as if you were in a walk-in bakery.",2016-01-02
1,1241,12,"The overall experience was a very pleasant one, and this could explain why it has always been my first choice each time I come to Tokyo.",2016-01-02
1,1242,1,Such a good place to spend NYE.,2016-01-02
1,1242,2,We booked executive suites with executive lounge access on the 37th floor.,2016-01-02

1,1242,4,The view was outstanding and it was a wonderful way to see in the new year.,2016-01-02
1,1242,5,The full buffet breakfast the next day was one of the best I'd ever experienced.,2016-01-02
1,1242,6,I'll definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends.,2016-01-02

1,1356,4,Hotel was at capacity during our stay due to some holidays around Asia as well as a public holiday in Japan.,2015-10-17
1,1356,5,I would like to share a positive and negative feedback.,2015-10-17
1,1356,6,"Starting with negative, I personally experienced some attitude from one of the staff during breakfast at the Marble lounge.",2015-10-17
1,1356,7,Monday was a public holiday in Japan and therefore the hotel was at capacity with waiters running around clearing tables for other guests.,2015-10-17
1,1356,8,I only needed some milk for my tea and an extra tea bag.,2015-10-17
1,1356,9,"Instead of disturbing the waiter, as I had to get breakfast from the buffet, I made my way to the coffee making area.",2015-10-17
1,1356,10,"I noticed that the pitchers had syrup in them and when asked the 2 members of staff at the coffee station, Mr Ito pointed using his finger that milk was behind him.",2015-10-17
1,1356,11,I acknowledged and asked whether I could have milk in a pitcher for my tea at my table.,2015-10-17
1,1356,12,The other staff member gladly grabbed a pitcher and filled it up with milk (simple task).,2015-10-17
1,1356,13,"As this was a tea/coffee station, I asked the same member of staff for kindly assisted me for an extra tea bag, Mr Ito seemed annoyed and make some comments in Japanese to the staff.",2015-10-17
1,1356,14,This left me with a bad taste.,2015-10-17
1,1356,15,"As I headed to my table, I shared this experienced with my mother in law (she's Japanese) and she decided to get some mineral water from the same area.",2015-10-17
1,1356,16,"When asked for water, she received a totally different service (from grabbing a glass to pouring the water for her when everything is self serve and in front of her).",2015-10-17
1,1356,17,Is it because she is Japanese and I'm not??,2015-10-17
1,1356,18,I observed Mr Ito over the next couple of days during breakfast and can clearly see that his motivation towards customer service is not his priority (No Omotenashi).,2015-10-17
1,1356,19,"On a positive side, Ms Kobayashi showed great interest in making sure that every guest within her area were well looked after or needed anything.",2015-10-17
1,1356,20,She was always checking for tea/coffee and clearing the table for empty plates.,2015-10-17

1,1356,24,A very great asset for this hotel with great potential of doing very well.,2015-10-17
1,1356,25,I do hope that this is the exception as this surely does not reflect the Japanese Omotenashi.,2015-10-17
1,1357,1,As always my stays at the Hilton Tokyo have been amazing.,2015-10-17
1,1357,2,"My last review gives great detail to my first (and continually ongoing) experience at the hotel, this review will cover my Executive Room upgrade and the benefits that go along with it!",2015-10-17
1,1357,3,This review is a little late and I do apologize!,2015-10-17

1,1357,8,The Hilton Tokyo has set my standards for what I expect from any property I stay at - worldwide!,2015-10-17
1,1357,9,"This time around I was lucky enough to get an upgrade to an Executive Room with Executive Lounge access, thank you Hilton Gold status, and I can't tell you how amazing it was.",2015-10-17
1,1357,10,"While I felt that the room itself and the quality of service I received was at the same fantastic level as it always is, the big difference to my stay was the Executive Lounge access.",2015-10-17
1,1357,11,On my first night at the Hilton Tokyo myself and my travel companion returned to the hotel after a day of exploration to enjoy some great snacks and beverages in the Executive Lounge.,2015-10-17
1,1357,12,The lounge itself was on the 37th floor and provided some amazing views of Tokyo at night while we snacked on a variety of hot and cold snacks along with a few beverages.,2015-10-17
1,1357,13,"There were plenty of finger food options (gyoza, small samples of soba noodles, etc,) and my travel companion stuck to soft drinks while I enjoyed a beer or two (or three, or four...) before heading back out into Shinjuku to find an izakaya for our main dinner.",2015-10-17
1,1357,14,On the second night we went to the lounge right at opening time and the concierge invited us to a secondary lounge that at the very least I could call a VIP lounge.,2015-10-17
1,1357,15,"Smaller, more intimate, with a different selection of finger foods, including caviar, this was an absolutely amazing experience.",2015-10-17
1,1357,16,"We spent the whole two hours eating and drinking while we chatted away, to the point where we felt that we really didn't need to go have dinner!",2015-10-17
1,1357,17,"The beverage selection was fantastic and included soft drinks, beer, and a fine selection of hard alcohol choices.",2015-10-17
1,1357,18,"Time flew by as we ate and drank, and before we knew it we were the last ones in the lounge still enjoying our drinks...30 minutes after it closed!",2015-10-17
1,1357,19,Very sheepishly we apologized to the remaining staff members and made our way back to our rooms to relax for the rest of the evening.,2015-10-17
1,1357,20,Another big bonus of my Executive/Gold status was the complimentary buffet breakfast in the morning.,2015-10-17
1,1357,21,"Hilton Gold will allow me to enjoy the buffet breakfast complimentary in the Marble Lounge on the first floor, the Executive Room will allow me to enjoy it in the Executive Lounge as an alternative.",2015-10-17
1,1357,22,The breakfast itself was fantastic with a wide variety of both Asian and Western selections for breakfast.,2015-10-17
1,1357,23,"While I was a bonus to have the Executive Lounge breakfast, I actually enjoyed the selection and atmosphere of the Marble Lounge buffet more.",2015-10-17
1,1357,24,"Overall my stay at the Tokyo Hilton was nothing short of fantastic, as usual!",2015-10-17
1,1357,25,"My Hilton Honors Gold upgrade entitled me to an Executive room with Executive Lounge access which added to my experience, thanks to the free evening beverages and snacks and an alternative place to have my morning breakfast.",2015-10-17
1,1357,26,In all honesty would I book a room at additional cost for Executive access?,2015-10-17
1,1357,27,"If it was a corporate booking and the company was paying for it, yes.",2015-10-17
1,1357,28,"If it was a personal booking and I was paying for it, no(I would hope my status got me the upgrade at no cost).",2015-10-17
1,1357,29,While the free food and drink from the lounge was enjoyable I would have to make sure I drank/ate the difference in price between a regular room and an Executive room - Which quite possibly could easily be beaten by a reasonable night of food and drink at a local izakaya.,2015-10-17
1,1357,30,I don't want to take anything away from the amazing staff at the Hilton Tokyo - There is a reason I am loyal to this hotel - however as a casual/personal traveller I would find it hard to justify the difference between a Executive room and a standard room unless the price difference is very minimal(less than $30/Y3000 per night).,2015-10-17
1,1357,31,Overall my rating of the Hilton Tokyo remains 5/5.,2015-10-17
1,1357,32,I'm always recognized as a return customer and a Hilton HHonors Gold member.,2015-10-17
1,1357,33,ALL the staff are extremely polite and courteous.,2015-10-17
1,1357,34,"The hotel itself has always been clean, comfortable, and enjoyable.",2015-10-17
1,1357,35,Is the Executive Room/Lounge worth it?,2015-10-17
1,1357,36,"Depending on the prices difference and who is paying for it,maybe.",2015-10-17
1,1357,37,"There are lots of local eating options which could meet/beat what the difference is between the two, depending on how much you can eat/drink!",2015-10-17
1,1357,38,Do I recommend the Hilton Tokyo?,2015-10-17
1,1357,39,Absolutely!,2015-10-17
1,1357,40,"As I've said many times the staff are amazing, the location is fantastic, and the rooms are always clean.",2015-10-17
1,1357,41,When it comes to a basic room vs an executive room its up to you to compare the prices and decide what is a better value.,2015-10-17
1,1357,42,"My next goal for the Hilton Tokyo - Finding out what the Golden Key Club is all about, and how I get invited to it!",2015-10-17
1,1358,1,From start to finish the hotel and staff were excellent.,2015-10-16
1,1358,2,We arrived at 6am by the airport limo bus from Haneda right to the hotel door.,2015-10-16
1,1358,3,We were there well before check in (2pm) but the front desk were very accommodating and helped us secure a room by 11 and gave us access to the executive floor for some breakfast while we waited.,2015-10-16
1,1358,4,Room was fantastic and large- only downfall is the toiletries provided are not enough.,2015-10-16
1,1358,5,Free bus into Shinjuku station every 20 minutes.,2015-10-16
1,1358,6,The standout service of the concierge staff members was the highlight.,2015-10-16
1,1358,7,"They helped to book tours, restaurants and were so helpful.",2015-10-16
1,1359,1,"Stayed here as part of a package tour, but we booked one night on our own before the tour.",2015-10-16
1,1359,2,"Rooms are comfortably large, with safe and water boiler.",2015-10-16
1,1359,3,We had requested 2 twin beds.,2015-10-16
1,1359,4,"Our guide subsequently told us twin beds are the norm in Japan, but the Hilton was out of twin rooms, so they installed a roll-away bed along with the queen sized bed already in the room and gave us complimentary breakfast for the trouble!",2015-10-16
1,1359,5,"Could hear some conversations in the corridor, but could not hear any of the street noise below (21st floor overlooking Shinjuku Central Park) except for the rare siren.",2015-10-16
1,1359,6,Breakfast available in the Marble Lounge on the 1st floor beginning at 0630 featured both Japanese and Western fare in their buffet.,2015-10-16
1,1359,7,"Easy access from Narita via the Airport Limousine Bus (tip: if you can buy from one of their US agents, the fare in USD can be cheaper than what you'd pay in Yen at Narita!).",2015-10-16
1,1359,8,Would definitely stay here again.,2015-10-16
1,1359,9,Location is 2 blocks from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building and 1 subway stop from Shinjuku Station (or about a 10-15 minute walk).,2015-10-16
1,1360,1,Stayed here and had a conference on site in September ..,2015-10-15
1,1360,2,"It's the Hilton experience which means good service , nice sized rooms but you pay for it ..",2015-10-15
1,1360,3,So a good base but head out of the hotel more reasonably priced meals and the bar on Level 2 could do with some more better bartenders ..,2015-10-15
1,1361,1,The rooms were a good size and very clean.,2015-10-14
1,1361,2,The lobby was nice and all the elevators worked!,2015-10-14
1,1361,3,"The restaurant was terrific for breakfast, we didn't eat there for dinners.",2015-10-14
1,1361,4,"The location was well located, walking distance to the train station, shopping and many good restaurants.",2015-10-14

1,1471,10,Didn't like:,2015-08-05
1,1471,11,Lack of storage space in the rooms.,2015-08-05
1,1471,12,"For two adults, the wardrobe space was too small, and nowhere near enough storage space or drawers for clothes.",2015-08-05
1,1471,13,We had to resort to leaving one case open on the floor.,2015-08-05
1,1471,14,"Rooms seem more designed for single traveller in terms of space, or maybe guests only staying a few days with little luggage.",2015-08-05
1,1472,1,My husband and I visited Tokyo for the first time in June (2015).,2015-08-02
1,1472,2,"Thanks to Hilton Tokyo's Shinjuku location and helpful staff, we were able to see and do everything we wanted to do in Tokyo.",2015-08-02
1,1472,3,We stayed with Hilton Tokyo (Shinjuku) for 9 nights.,2015-08-02
1,1472,4,We only were able to use their complimentary wi-fi for seven nights as that is the limit of what they provide.,2015-08-02
1,1472,5,"While we were able to use their wi-fi, it worked well and without fail.",2015-08-02
1,1472,6,"On multiple occasions we used the concierge desk, and it was due to these interactions that we were able to do everything we wanted to do in Tokyo.",2015-08-02
1,1472,7,"There are multiple restaurants (such as Alice's Fantasy Restaurant and The Final Fantasy Eorzea Cafe) that are very hard to book online if you don't speak Japanese, or simply won't let you book until you are in Japan due to the need to pick up tickets.",2015-08-02
1,1472,8,"The concierge desk worked with us on multiple occasions to not only call restaurants to help us make reservations, but to also help us book tickets on a website in Japanese that we couldn't read.",2015-08-02
1,1472,9,They also printed us confirmations and gave us maps that directed us where to go.,2015-08-02
1,1472,10,"As we were preparing to leave, the concierge also helped us to book tickets on the Friendly Limousine bus that drove directly to the Narita Airport (This drive takes about an hour and there are bathrooms on the bus!), and helped us mail back our pocket wi-fi we were renting for our stay.",2015-08-02
1,1472,11,We deeply appreciated their help as they made our trip everything we dreamt it would be.,2015-08-02
1,1472,12,Another great perk to this hotel is its connection to the Nishi-Shinjuku Metro Station.,2015-08-02
1,1472,13,To get to this station requires about a five-10 minute walk above ground or the same underground.,2015-08-02
1,1472,14,We were able to walk from the station to this on hotel on multiple occasions without ever emerging above ground.,2015-08-02
1,1472,15,The Hilton also has an underground mall connected to it called Hiltopia.,2015-08-02

1,1472,18,Hiltopia also has an ATM machine my husband and I used on multiple occasions.,2015-08-02
1,1472,19,"As for the room, we had plenty of space.",2015-08-02
1,1472,20,The bed was comfortable.,2015-08-02

1,1472,24,"When in Tokyo, watching Naruto and Howl's Moving Castle is kind of in the rules.",2015-08-02
1,1472,25,"The bathroom looked very nice and the hotel kindly provides many amenities (toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, face soap, hairdryer, etc.), but we struggled with the shower.",2015-08-02
1,1472,26,"We had come from the Disneyland Hotel that had a shower room, which meant the expectation was the water was going to fall directly onto the floor and go down a drain.",2015-08-02
1,1472,27,"In the Hilton Tokyo, there is only a tiny glass divider provided directly next to the shower head, which does not do a great job of stopping the water from getting on the floor.",2015-08-02
1,1472,28,"The floor does have a drain, so maybe this is expected?",2015-08-02
1,1472,29,We were entirely confused.,2015-08-02
1,1472,30,"The water pressure and temperature were always nice though, so this was just a minor inconvenience.",2015-08-02
1,1472,31,"A note for vegetarians: Their buffet breakfast does provide many options including pancakes, french toast, an omelette station that is made to order, plain rice, potatoes, cereal, etc.",2015-08-02
1,1472,32,"The only ""disappointment"" is that all the edible options for vegetarians are very westernized, which means we miss out on all the delicious looking Japanese options.",2015-08-02
1,1472,33,"We enjoyed this breakfast once during our stay, but as we could not eat enough every morning to justify the cost, we instead began eating our breakfast at the Royal Host right outside the hotel.",2015-08-02
1,1472,34,"This is Tokyo's version of a much nicer ""Denny's"" that is reasonably priced and also provides basic breakfast vegetarian options.",2015-08-02
1,1472,35,"Overall, we were completely comfortable our entire stay, even with knowing only a little Japanese, and were able to focus on enjoying our time in Tokyo.",2015-08-02

1,1481,4,"When the lady saw our booking details, her reaction was a bit weird.",2015-07-27
1,1481,5,"While she was looking at her monitor, there were two other hotel staff were beside her and discussed about our booking.",2015-07-27
1,1481,6,"Somehow, they completed the check in and informed us to sit for a while to wait for our rooms to be ready.",2015-07-27
1,1481,7,"After waited about 30 minutes , we got our rooms.",2015-07-27

1,1481,9,"There were wires everywhere, loose and unmatched furniture.",2015-07-27
1,1481,10,"As it was midnight and we were too tired to clarify with the front counter and my sister who had checked in earlier, we quickly showered and went to bed.",2015-07-27
1,1481,11,"The next morning I went to my sister's room, who had booked the same category of room type as mine (she arrived the hotel few hours earlier than me).",2015-07-27
1,1481,12,"When I entered her room, I noticed her room was totally different from my room",2015-07-27
1,1481,13,We went down to the front counter and met the front desk shift leader to clarify the matter.,2015-07-27
1,1481,14,"He told us that the night shift staff informed us about the condition of our rooms before they given the rooms to us, and we accepted.",2015-07-27
1,1481,15,This message had made us very disappointed because none of the staff informed us about that.,2015-07-27
1,1481,16,We really can't believe the night shift staff even made up the story about their arrangement.,2015-07-27
1,1481,17,Which mean their intention is very clear to cheat us with the standard rooms for executive rooms.,2015-07-27
1,1481,18,"After a long talk, the shift leader tried to offer us a dinner at the hotel to settle the complaint, we rejected as we already had other plans.",2015-07-27
1,1481,19,"As we were short of time for our other activities on that day, we told him to discuss with his higher management on this issue and we will meet him in the evening for the answer.",2015-07-27
1,1481,20,"We felt very disappointed and regretful not only we had to waste time complaint to them, the irresponsible night shift staff even made the story to cover their action.",2015-07-27
1,1481,21,"Although in the evening on our return, the hotel told us that they arranged to upgrade out rooms to suite rooms.",2015-07-27
1,1481,22,We told them it is meaningless because we need to head to airport early morning the next day.,2015-07-27
1,1481,23,We really can't accept such a poor and irresponsible arrangement.,2015-07-27
1,1481,24,"This is Hilton, not a budget hotel.",2015-07-27

1,1482,8,Wifi was also free.,2015-07-26
1,1482,9,My only complaint was that i would have preferred a casual dining restaurant where i could just enjoy good Japanese food without having to pay an arm and a leg.,2015-07-26
1,1482,10,I wish Hilton would start a restaurant that provides authentic Japanese food like one of those small local restaurants.,2015-07-26

1,1483,7,We absolutely loved our stay at the Hilton!,2015-07-25
1,1483,8,It's important to note that there is a subway stop under the hotel so if you get an all day subway pass its super easy to get back to the hotel after going out into Tokyo.,2015-07-25
1,1483,9,The hotel is located in the quieter part of shinjuku.,2015-07-25

1,1484,3,"There was a long queue to get to the registration desk for both check in and check out, so if you have access to the executive lounge floor, you might try your luck up there.",2015-07-25
1,1484,4,The entertainment in the ground floor lounge was perfect for a post dinner cocktail.,2015-07-25
1,1485,1,Overall the hotel was satisfactory.,2015-07-25
1,1485,2,"A little out of the way if you're looking to pack in a lot of sightseeing in a short time, or join the group bus tours - we got dropped off last.",2015-07-25
1,1485,3,The room was adequate but nothing special.,2015-07-25
1,1485,4,The service was mixed - especially at the concierge.,2015-07-25
1,1485,5,"One day we had someone who was so helpful, next day the person working there ignored us.",2015-07-25
1,1485,6,But the big highlight of this hotel was the restaurants - very good.,2015-07-25
1,1485,7,We enjoyed the sushi bar and the steakhouse.,2015-07-25
1,1485,8,In general we got the impression that things closed early.,2015-07-25
1,1485,9,We expected Tokyo and this neighborhood to be more lively at night.,2015-07-25
1,1486,1,I stayed at this hotel for nine nights while in Japan on business.,2015-07-25
1,1486,2,The good: The hotel location is sufficient for getting around.,2015-07-25

1,1486,11,I took to wearing earplugs and that helped.,2015-07-25
1,1486,12,My bathroom was not cleaned daily.,2015-07-25
1,1486,13,"Yes, the bed was made and the toiletries were replenished as needed.",2015-07-25

1,1486,15,I had to bring it to their attention twice.,2015-07-25
1,1486,16,Then the problem was resolved.,2015-07-25
1,1486,17,I wasn't feeling well one day.,2015-07-25
1,1486,18,"I thought I would make it through dinner at the restaurant, but couldn't.",2015-07-25

1,1486,20,I was told no.,2015-07-25
1,1486,21,"Now, that was the only thing that really bothered me.",2015-07-25
1,1486,22,"The food was expensive and average-tasting at best, but it was what I had.",2015-07-25
1,1486,23,"I understand that it is not the norm there to allow carry-out, but I was staying in the hotel for an extended amount of time.",2015-07-25
1,1486,24,"If I hadn't been so tired, I probably would have pressed the issue.",2015-07-25

1,1614,6,"The hotel itself is on the western side of the district, surrounded by towers representing government and commerce.",2015-05-30
1,1614,7,"In this area, bars, restaurants and shops are largely found either underground or at the top of the buildings.",2015-05-30
1,1614,8,"The eastern side of Shinjuku, famous for its wild and colourful nightlife as well as the rail station, is about 10 minutes walk away.",2015-05-30
1,1614,9,There are several metro line stations within a few minutes walk of the hotel and you'll need them to get around this giant city.,2015-05-30
1,1614,10,"Our room was clean, of a good size and with good air con and facilities.",2015-05-30
1,1614,11,Maid service was excellent.,2015-05-30
1,1614,12,The bathroom was on the small side and awkwardly designed but had a great shower.,2015-05-30
1,1614,13,Breakfast was in the Marble Lounge on the ground floor - a barn of a space that lacked atmosphere and itself merged into reception.,2015-05-30
1,1614,14,The quality of the buffet was good with a mix of local and Western offerings.,2015-05-30
1,1614,15,"As a loyalty programme member, we were able to have breakfast on the 2nd floor restaurant but it was more chaotic and the re-stocking of food wasn't good.",2015-05-30
1,1614,16,There's an English-style pub on the ground floor but we didn't really like it - partly because it seemed a lot smokier - and preferred the bar on the stylish 2nd floor.,2015-05-30

1,1615,8,We were a little taken aback by all the taxes on the final bill even after pre- paying- we should have realised this at the time of booking- that there are quite a few little taxes in Tokyo.,2015-05-29
1,1615,9,We did try to have a game of tennis when we had a spare 30mins but the cost of using the court and hiring rackets and balls was another surprise- I'm thinking space in Tokyo is so limited all costs must be recouped!,2015-05-29
1,1615,10,Appreciated the free browsing internet in room.,2015-05-29
1,1616,1,My husband and I stayed here for the first 7 nights of our 31-day trip to Japan--and were extremely pleased!,2015-05-29
1,1616,2,"LOCATION: Although it's not in the center of the city (or bustling with nightlife, like Ginza), it was perfect for us because (1) the basement level has a tunnel to the satellite station (NishiShinjuku) of the largest (busiest) train station in the world, Shinjuku (which is alternately just a 13-minute walk directly from the hotel and the center of lots of activity, such as famous department stores and museums)--and our purpose was touring the many widespread attractions of Tokyo and surrounding areas; (2) the hotel is in a business district, so the streets and sidewalks are not over-crowded and nearly empty at night, and very quiet; (3) a peaceful park is right across the street--as are other conveniences, as noted in other review; (4) the views from the higher floors are spectacular; (5) plenty of temporary parking right in front for our private guide for touring outside the city.",2015-05-29
1,1616,3,"ACCOMMODATIONS: As Hilton Gold, we were fortunately and graciously upgraded to a very spacious two-room suite on the 17th floor, affording access to our choice of either the Executive Lounge or the Gold Lounge for huge breakfast buffet and ample evening hors d'oeuvres and desserts.",2015-05-29

1,1616,6,"The staff always graciously provided my husband with a box of soy milk and a banana for me to enjoy in our suite with the vegan items I'd brought from home.)

1,1616,7,STAFF: We experienced genuine graciousness and efficient expertise throughout: from the porters to the receptionists to the concierges & servers at the private lounges to the restaurant staff.,2015-05-29
1,1616,8,"(We dined only one night--in their Japanese restaurant, which is one of several options--to entertain guests, as none of the restaurants could do full vegan meals, but the staff went out of their way to provide items that did work for me, and my husband and our guests found the food outstanding and beautifully presented.) The bell desk staff also took excellent care of having our luggage forwarded to our Osaka hotel (a totally different chain), for which we could put the charges on our bill--and our luggage was in our room at our Osaka hotel when we arrived the next day via bullet train.",2015-05-29
1,1616,9,TIP FOR VEGANS: You can get a good enough breakfast at the Executive Lounge or Gold Lounge--and there's a charming little Indian restaurant in the basement-level shopping arcade.,2015-05-29
1,1616,10,We plan to return to Japan and this hotel will be our first choice!,2015-05-29

Proactively asked irrelevant questions before understanding my needs (I just wanted to leave a bag at concierge but the bell boy asked me several questions that are irrelevant to my needs, e.g. when was my flight, have I booked airport shuttle ticket, how many person I am travelling with, and etc) - should ask right question & listen to customer needs",2015-05-28

1,1622,7,2. this is really not a complain but the bed is firm!,2015-05-28
1,1622,8,"back breaking firm, my wife and I barely got any sleep because the bed is so hard, it feels like sleeping on hard floor, i ended up sleeping on the long sofa because it was softer, the staff was nice enough to add a pad every time we complained but it just gets really lumpy after 3 pads,we had asked to change room, but was informed that every room as the same bed.",2015-05-28

1,1632,8,The staff was very helpful arranging further travel.,2015-05-26
1,1633,1,We had a lovely executive room with a beautiful view over Tokyo.,2015-05-26

1,1635,3,"They offered us an upgrade to the executive floor (36/37) for $100 a night, but that didn't seem worth it.",2015-05-25
1,1635,4,"This hotel does everything it's supposed to do - it's relatively central (although definitely not in a cool neighborhood as it's on the quiet west side of Shinjuku which has a CBD vibe), it has all the facilities you'd expect, but it is a little dated and there's no real wow factor.",2015-05-25
1,1635,5,It's a solid 4 star.,2015-05-25
1,1635,6,"When we travelled, however, it was also quite good value.",2015-05-25
1,1635,7,So the message is - make sure you pay 4 star rates.,2015-05-25
1,1635,8,A couple of minor quibbles (none of them major):,2015-05-25
1,1635,9,* The breakfast was pretty average - you can tell most things are frozen - but it did have an omelette station and very nice baguettes (made by their in-house French patisserie).,2015-05-25
1,1635,10,But I'm very food focussed so for most people it would be totally fine.,2015-05-25
1,1635,11,"It gets very busy, especially between 8 and 9 as there are a lot of business travelers.",2015-05-25
1,1635,12,* This hotel is BIG and BUSY.,2015-05-25
1,1635,13,The lift ride from the 34th down to the lobby almost drove me crazy as it would stop on average about 5 or 6 times on the way down.,2015-05-25
1,1635,14,* Gym and pool are average.,2015-05-25
1,1635,15,* There is not much immediately around the hotel - but there are two subway stations 10 minutes walk away.,2015-05-25
1,1635,16,* The hotel floors smell of smoke.,2015-05-25
1,1635,17,"These were all not major issues, but just be aware that the experience just generally lacks the wow factor that might make it 5 star.",2015-05-25
1,1635,18,This is partially because the hotel is just too big to offer that next level of service.,2015-05-25
1,1635,19,"On a more positive note - we ate at the Metropolitan Grill on a couple of nights, and the staff there is ridiculously nice.",2015-05-25

1,1637,1,"This hotel is beautiful, the staff is very helpful, and the rooms are excellent!",2015-05-24
1,1637,2,"The hotel's complementary shuttle to the Shinjuku Station is excellent for transportation, but we also took taxis around which were easily accessible from the bell staff as well.",2015-05-24
1,1637,3,"The 24 hour mart is great for snacks, souvenirs, and items.",2015-05-24

1,1638,4,Hotel booking was made through lastminute.com and paid in full prior to traveling.,2015-05-23
1,1638,5,Hotel Toyko still went ahead and charged me again on my credit card at checkout.,2015-05-23
1,1638,6,It's proving difficult to get it resolved even though last minute.com have confirmed to hotel they have made an error.,2015-05-23

1,1656,3,We later found out that while it was true that the hotel was busy there is not free internet in the rooms and so many people would hang around the lobby using the internet.,2015-05-07
1,1656,4,People would sit on the wooden partition to the restaurant so while people were trying to have a meal or a quiet drink they would have others sitting quite literally next to them on the phone!,2015-05-07
1,1656,5,We were given a room on 27th floor and one evening we noticed a cockroach on the mirror.,2015-05-07
1,1656,6,We called down and they sent a really sweet young man up with bug spray and chocolates!!!!,2015-05-07
1,1656,7,"As we all know, if we see one cockroach there are many more around.",2015-05-07
1,1656,8,We made it clear that we were not happy to stay in the same room and rather than upgrade us they gave us a room lower down on 18th floor!,2015-05-07
1,1656,9,So we packed up and moved.,2015-05-07
1,1656,10,The following day I called to complain to a duty manager only to be informed that there was a room on a higher floor.,2015-05-07
1,1656,11,So we packed all our things yet again and naively thought that they would at the very least give us a better room or access to the lounge.,2015-05-07
1,1656,12,Nope!,2015-05-07
1,1656,13,Exactly the same room on a higher floor.,2015-05-07
1,1656,14,We were truly disgusted by such lack of service and disregard to the inconvenience of it all.,2015-05-07
1,1656,15,We really thought that the Hilton would do better but were truly let down.,2015-05-07
1,1656,16,Breakfast had a good selection but staff taking the empty dishes away were very slow as was delivery of the hot beverages.,2015-05-07
1,1656,17,The lobby was often very cluttered with luggage because rather than move luggage to a room behind the scenes it would be left there piled up!,2015-05-07
1,1657,1,"This was a family trip to Tokyo, we booked 3 rooms altogether and they were lovely.",2015-05-06
1,1657,2,The rooms could be a little more spacious but that's me just being picky!,2015-05-06
1,1657,3,The view out of the hotel window on the 35th floor was incredible both morning and at night time.,2015-05-06
1,1657,4,Staff were incredibly helpful and courteous.,2015-05-06
1,1657,5,The free wifi on the lobby level was great too just to catch up on emails or keep in touch with loved ones.,2015-05-06
1,1657,6,"A short walk from the main area of Shinjuku and plenty to see and do on the way, underground malls etc",2015-05-06
1,1657,7,Also if you don't like the walk you can get the subway from just a few minutes from your doorstep into Shinjuku station and onwards.,2015-05-06
1,1658,1,This hotel is located in the central financial district of Shinjuku.,2015-05-06
1,1658,2,The hotel staff are the most helpful and courteous people we have encountered in a long time.,2015-05-06
1,1658,3,The room was spacious and had an amazing view.,2015-05-06
1,1658,4,"The restaurants were pricey but good, about what you expect for this caliber hotel in Tokyo.",2015-05-06
1,1659,1,"Great location, free shuttle, nice views, modern rooms, excellent buffet breakfast, 24 hour convenience store at the basement...",2015-05-06
1,1659,2,Wifi is the only downside.,2015-05-06
1,1659,3,"It's free at the lobby but 1,700 yen in-room (unless you're HHonours Gold and above).",2015-05-06

1,1660,1,"The rooms are comfortable and modern, well equipped.",2015-05-05
1,1660,2,the feeling is of a good 4.5 star hotel.,2015-05-05
1,1660,3,The breakfast is also superb.,2015-05-05
1,1660,4,The service was a little lacking during the busy cherry blossom season- not enough staff and we had to wait in line for every small request.,2015-05-05
1,1660,5,"That being said, all requests were treated perfectly.",2015-05-05
1,1661,1,Choose this hotel because good reviews but was rather disappointed-rooms fairly outdated - carpet not very clean and small bathroom with no separate shower in deluxe room.,2015-05-04
1,1661,2,Concierge service disappointing as well as uninterested and not even bothered to show us the directions when walking out - as silver member of Hilton traveling around the world this is definitely not my best experience,2015-05-04
1,1662,1,We stayed at Hilton Tokyo for 4 nights in late March with our 2 boys (3 years old and 1 years old).,2015-05-04
1,1662,2,"We have connecting King Deluxe/Twin Deluxe Rooms (rooms 1827/1828) - rooms were a good size (bigger than expected), recently renovated and the arrangement was perfect for us.",2015-05-04
1,1662,3,We did not have Executive Lounge access which was a bit disappointed as HH Gold (I felt we were perhaps penalized as we needed connecting rooms).,2015-05-04
1,1662,4,"Good location for exploring Tokyo (near to rail stations, many places walkable).",2015-05-04
1,1662,5,Took the Airport Limo bus direct from Narita Airport - very easy.,2015-05-04
1,1662,6,Also easy to get taxis from outside.,2015-05-04
1,1662,7,We used the hotel babysitting service on 2 nights (a 3rd party company) and whilst incredibly expensive (US$215.00 for 3 hours) the company seemed very professional so would recommend them.,2015-05-04
1,1662,8,"Only issue on the first night was that, despite telling Concierge in advance not to call our room when the babysitter arrived (as the kids would be asleep), sure enough they phoned up and woke the kids up!",2015-05-04
1,1662,9,Quality and variety of food at the breakfast in the main lobby was great.,2015-05-04
1,1662,10,"Service not so good - two out of the three mornings they tried to usher us into an overflow area (smoky bar area), I think because we had kids, as there was space in the main area which I pointed out.",2015-05-04
1,1662,11,"One evening (between 5PM and 6PM) we tried to order some food for the kids in the main lobby restaurant, but were told this was not possible as between 5PM and 6PM they need to clean the tables - seems a bit silly (particularly as round the clock food is advertised in that restaurant), kids were starving so we had to leave the hotel and go elsewhere as we did not want room service.",2015-05-04
1,1662,12,"All in all a nice hotel, perfect for business travellers, couples, people with older kids we just felt that travelling with young kids some of the staff werent particularly welcoming.",2015-05-04
1,1662,13,"(Contrast Hilton Osaka where we stayed a few days later - see separate review, where no problems at all from that perspective)",2015-05-04
1,1663,1,"good to have shuttle bus to shinjuku shopping area, train station and express bus station.",2015-05-04
1,1663,2,"We have a good stay at executive floor, quiet and pleasant.",2015-05-04
1,1663,3,Breakfast at executive floor rather less choice.,2015-05-04
1,1663,4,still prefer to join the crowd at main restaurant.,2015-05-04
1,1663,5,"Is easy to use their underpass walkway to shinjuku station, but when return, for days we cant find the correct way back.",2015-05-04

1,1664,4,During find the room check-in guy try to find my room but it take 45 mins for that!!!,2015-05-04

1,1664,15,I try to impress my family with Hilton but they didn't like them.,2015-05-04
1,1664,16,But if we talking about Hotel facility its OK the room quite small for 2 and one kids for one is OK.,2015-05-04
1,1664,17,I really would like to share this and hope Hilton Tokyo will change their services to make Hilton standard.,2015-05-04

1,1665,2,From Shinjuku station you can get anywhere!,2015-05-04
1,1665,3,"I heard there is also a subway station very nearby the hotel, but we did not avail of it.",2015-05-04
1,1665,4,"We only had two short days, so hopped the train and subways to try and cover as much as Tokyo as we could, so we did not take advantage of being in Shinjuku.",2015-05-04
1,1665,5,Right near the hotel you have the Metropolitan government building with a free observation deck (I heard it is nice) and there are some interesting areas surrounding the train station (red light district - we didn't have time to see it).,2015-05-04
1,1665,6,We stayed in an executive room.,2015-05-04
1,1665,7,It was marvelous.,2015-05-04

1,1665,10,"We took our breakfast in the lobby buffet, which was very diverse and clean.",2015-05-04
1,1665,11,You can eat at the lounge but it has less options (but also less hectic).,2015-05-04
1,1665,12,They offer soft drinks all day and delicious appetizers and quite a bit of alcohol for happy hour.,2015-05-04
1,1665,13,I understand they have also have afternoon tea.,2015-05-04
1,1665,14,Lounge also has free wi-fi.,2015-05-04
1,1665,15,"To Narita we ended up taking the shuttle bus not the Narita express, because Shinjuku station is huge and we didn't want to lug our suitcases around.",2015-05-04

1,1668,1,I went to great lengths to research accommodation options in Tokyo that would be accessible for wheelchair users.,2015-05-03
1,1668,2,I phoned and emailed in January about request for disabled access room.,2015-05-03
1,1668,3,I have stayed at Hilton hotels before and was confident from the email confirmation that an wheelchair accessible room was available for our stay.,2015-05-03
1,1668,4,On arrival on 28 th April we were advised the room I had confirmed was not available and had been given to other guests.,2015-05-03
1,1668,5,Initially we were not given an apology or other options until we then had to log onto Wi-Fi to show email that we had in fact had written confirmation.,2015-05-03
1,1668,6,I was travelling with family from Australia and this really was upsetting.,2015-05-03
1,1668,7,I have never had a hotel confirm in writing that an disabled access room will be provided and then it is not provided.,2015-05-03
1,1668,8,"Unfortunately this overshadowed our stay and the subsequent attempts made by staff ( once we insisted that no in fact I can't walk, use a bath over a shower etc) to make up for this major issue, ie provision of shower chair etc.",2015-05-03
1,1668,9,"I did raise this issue with the front desk, however on check out my husband was not asked about our stay.",2015-05-03
1,1668,10,I am happy to be contacted by management to discuss further as Im not confident that I could book with hilton hotels again.,2015-05-03
1,1668,11,I'm sorry to be so negative but the initial response by the check in counter that its a busy time of year as the reason for the room not being available was appalling.,2015-05-03
1,1669,1,"Being built all the way back for the 1964 Olympics, this Hilton hotel is still looking really sharp.",2015-05-02
1,1669,2,"Main area's, hallways and elevators look like the have just been redone.",2015-05-02
1,1669,3,"The standard rooms could do with an upgrade though; especially the bathroom (however well-maintained) was a bit outdated, and the furniture shows a few years of experience through scuffmarks.",2015-05-02
1,1669,4,The traditional Japanese yukata's in the room instead of standard bath robes are a nice touch.,2015-05-02

1,1669,6,"My girlfriend arranged a sweet in-room breakfast to which the Hilton did not only add complimentary mimosa's, but also two nice pairs of chopsticks and a beautiful love story giving special meaning to them.",2015-05-02
1,1669,7,"Besides al this, they gave us a larger version of their standard room on a high floor looking out over the Shinjuku district sky scrapers.",2015-05-02
1,1669,8,"Thanks, Hilton Tokyo!!",2015-05-02

1,1669,10,I think the Hilton is a very good choice for a stay in Tokyo and I would surely consider staying here again.,2015-05-02

1,1670,10,Very nice.,2015-05-02
1,1670,11,There is a shuttle to Shinjuku station but those who are familiar with Tokyo's subway and metro rail system would be quicker to catch it from Tochomae station to get around rather than go all the way to Shinjuku station.,2015-05-02
1,1670,12,You can get to the station using the underpass just outside the hotel.,2015-05-02
1,1670,13,Quite enjoyed my stay here and will definitely be back.,2015-05-02

1,1671,6,My only negative comment is the fact that the lobby is always overcrowded with noisy groups or people sitting there taking advantage of the free wifi.,2015-05-01

1,1672,6,Lobby service not quite as good as the Hyatt Regency but was still efficient and helpful.,2015-04-30

1,1673,13,As Hilton gold card member wifi was free although if not you have to pay.,2015-04-29

1,1676,4,My one major complaint was that they allow smoking in the bar.,2015-04-28
1,1676,5,While I understand that this is acceptable in Japan the hotel chain is an international brand which should have better standards.,2015-04-28
1,1676,6,The bar was adjacent to the breakfast area and is used as an overflow for diners.,2015-04-28
1,1676,7,I was not prepared to eat in an area that still smelled terribly of smoke from the night before (stale!!!) so I had to wait for a suitable table in the main area.,2015-04-28
1,1676,8,The hosts were not that happy about me taking a table for 2 rather than sitting at the bar but the smell really was off putting.,2015-04-28
1,1676,9,The wifi in the lobby dropped out often and was a bit slow and there are fairly hefty charges for in room internet.,2015-04-28
1,1676,10,The beds were very firm which was great and the room was extremely quiet.,2015-04-28
1,1676,11,The location was great for my needs.,2015-04-28
1,1677,1,We stay 4 night in this hotel.,2015-04-27

1,1677,8,The hotel staff escort us every process even we do not check in yet.,2015-04-27
1,1677,9,Hotel's location is little bit far for walk to Shinjuku but they have shuttle bus to serve us every 30 minute with free of charge.,2015-04-27
1,1677,10,and lower floor of hotel is connect to subway station.,2015-04-27
1,1677,11,No another place perfect than this hotel in Shinjuku for my opinion.,2015-04-27
1,1677,12,Everytime back to Tokyo must be this hotel .,2015-04-27
1,1677,13,Very impressive.,2015-04-27
1,1677,14,Nothing to complain.,2015-04-27
1,1677,15,"If you have little bit more budget for hotel when you visit tokyo, must try this hotel.",2015-04-27
1,1678,1,We stayed for our last night in Tokyo.,2015-04-27
1,1678,2,"I have to say that proximity wise I would prefer the Ginza or Shibuya, as Shinjuku station is a hike with bags in tow.",2015-04-27
1,1678,3,When you do get out though the area is peaceful and lovely.,2015-04-27
1,1678,4,The lobby area is lovely and well appointed.,2015-04-27

1,1678,9,"I think the price matched the accommodation, however it does look like the hotel may require a face lift in the near future as the carpets and furnishings are starting to date.",2015-04-27
1,1678,10,On the whole it is great hotel that I would stay at again.,2015-04-27
1,1679,1,This Hilton was amazing!,2015-04-27
1,1679,2,Thank you Hilton for the upgrade to the executive suite!!,2015-04-27
1,1679,3,You made our family vacation.,2015-04-27
1,1679,4,The staff in the executive lounge was great.,2015-04-27
1,1679,5,After meeting you once..they welcome you every other day with a familiar welcome and asked about our day(in English) which they all spoke very well!,2015-04-27
1,1679,6,Can't wait to come back for 10 days next year!!,2015-04-27
1,1680,1,We stayed at the Hilton Tokyo for 3 nights in April 2015.,2015-04-27
1,1680,2,It was our first time to Tokyo and we wanted to stay in the Shinjuku area.,2015-04-27
1,1680,3,We caught the friendly limo bus service from Haneda and arrived at around 9am.,2015-04-27
1,1680,4,We couldn't check-in as it was too early and were asked to come back as late as possible to make it easier for them.,2015-04-27
1,1680,5,I didn't know that the advertised check-in time in Japan is stuck to - they will not allow you to check in early so this is something to bear in mind if you are on a early arrival flight.,2015-04-27
1,1680,6,Our bags were taken from us as soon as we entered the lobby and were put in our room ready for us when we did check in later on that day.,2015-04-27
1,1680,7,Check-in was easy and the reception and lobby staff were very friendly.,2015-04-27
1,1680,8,The room we had was on a high floor and was lovely.,2015-04-27
1,1680,9,It was a great size for a Japanese room and the bathroom was a good size as well.,2015-04-27
1,1680,10,Everything was so clean and there are plenty of toiletries provided in case you need anything.,2015-04-27
1,1680,11,The bed was so comfortable and very big - the bedding was great quality and we had 3 wonderful nights of sleep after long days of sightseeing.,2015-04-27
1,1680,12,There is also plenty of room for storing bigger suitcases and clothes if you are there on a longer trip which was handy so you were not tripping over things like you can in smaller Japanese hotels.,2015-04-27
1,1680,13,The shower was quite powerful and plenty of towels were provided each day.,2015-04-27
1,1680,14,The wi-fi is not free at this hotel but there is a free business centre with plenty of Mac's which you can use just off from the lobby.,2015-04-27
1,1680,15,It also has a little seating and table area which can be handy to use when you first arrive as the lobby is always busy with little seating available.,2015-04-27
1,1680,16,The hotel does offer a free shuttle bus to Shinjuku station which we did catch on our first day there but it was full each time we saw it depart so we just used to walk the 10 minutes there instead of waiting for it.,2015-04-27
1,1680,17,"There is also 2 metro/subway stations which you can walk to using the underground walkthrough the hotel has, it took us around 5 - 8 minutes to walk too.",2015-04-27
1,1680,18,There is a shopping mall attached to the hotel called Hiltopia which has a couple of small supermarkets in there which are useful for picking up drinks and snacks for the room.,2015-04-27
1,1680,19,There were also a few nice looking restaurants and bars in the hotel but unfortunately we never got the chance to try them as we were always out in Tokyo and preferred to eat in the city.,2015-04-27
1,1680,20,Overall we had a fantastic stay and will definitely stay here again when we visit Tokyo again in the near future.,2015-04-27
1,1681,1,"This is a lovely property, but the service I experienced here was nowhere near what I would expect from a Hilton.",2015-04-26
1,1681,2,"It was, for some reason, shabby.",2015-04-26
1,1681,3,My room wasn't serviced during my two day stay.,2015-04-26
1,1681,4,I don't know why - but certainly no one at the hotel took any action about it.,2015-04-26
1,1681,5,"The real let down was, however, service in the bar.",2015-04-26
1,1681,6,"Even with four staff, and a manager, it took us twenty minutes standing at the bar before we were even allowed to order (there were less than a dozen guests in the place) and a further twenty minutes to get drinks - except, of course, they had forgot my beer entirely.",2015-04-26
1,1681,7,"Terrible, terrible service Hilton: I have to come back to you in a few days - please improve.",2015-04-26
1,1682,1,"I’m sure many of the travelers to this hotel are business travelers, but without a doubt having spent a good amount of time in the lobby, there’s also a sizeable portion of folks there for sight-seeing.",2015-04-26
1,1682,2,"With this taken into consideration, I was surprised at how unhelpful the concierge was in helping us out.",2015-04-26
1,1682,3,"Take, for example, their helping with our trip to check out Sumo practice.",2015-04-26
1,1682,4,They had no connections with any tour companies that could assure a spot at a stable from which to watch the practice.,2015-04-26
1,1682,5,"They did, however, have a map they assured us we could use to find our own and sit in on practices.",2015-04-26
1,1682,6,"So we dutifully showed up in the neighborhood a few days later, map in hand, eager to see things.",2015-04-26
1,1682,7,Turns out the map is completely outdated.,2015-04-26
1,1682,8,"Over an hour of frenetic searching and help from local Japanese, who also couldn’t understand the poorly labeled map, we gave up.",2015-04-26
1,1682,9,Wasted a precious morning.,2015-04-26
1,1682,10,What's strange is that such sub-standard concierge assistance could persist.,2015-04-26
1,1682,11,I’m sure these guys get requests for tourist help all the time.,2015-04-26
1,1682,12,"Perhaps most than any country I’ve ever been to, it would in principle be *very* helpful to have a skilled concierge that could help you navigate the confusing local Japanese system.",2015-04-26
1,1682,13,"Yet these guys can’t help you book train tickets, make tour bookings, or buy a local SIM like I could from a comparably nice hotel in, say, Hong Kong.",2015-04-26
1,1682,14,"I don’t know what the deal is, but one of the big reasons I stayed at this hotel was to get help from the concierge and net-net, it was actually a counterproductive experience.",2015-04-26
1,1683,1,I stayed four nights here with my family in a tower suite.,2015-04-25
1,1683,2,Terrific stay!,2015-04-25
1,1683,3,The staff -- from the check-in agent to the bellman to the concierge -- were incredibly friendly and helpful and went out of their way to accommodate us and make us feel welcome.,2015-04-25
1,1683,4,(Why can't it be more like this in USA?!?).,2015-04-25
1,1683,5,"The room was quite large, especially by Japanese standards (although the sink area was a bit cramped).",2015-04-25
1,1683,6,The fitness center was stocked with great machines.,2015-04-25
1,1683,7,The breakfast was extraordinary; everything you could imagine was available and it all tasted great.,2015-04-25
1,1683,8,"I really liked the convenience of the hotel, connected underground to a subway stop, and a free shuttle bus to the closest JR train station.",2015-04-25
1,1683,9,"On my next trip to Tokyo, I absolutely am returning.",2015-04-25
1,1684,1,"Let's do it fairly, the price is not cheap at all, but the room, is just usual, furniture far from being impressive, the window, you can just open half of it....",2015-04-25
1,1684,2,"In my vie, it is a massive hotel with no personal touch, there are too many people at the lobby, waiting long to get their service and the worst one is, internet in the room is not free (even cheap hotels in Japan can provide it for free.",2015-04-25
1,1684,3,"The good thing is staff is nice, although not really that nice but mechanic (been to other hotel in Japan where the staff is excellently nice...",2015-04-25
1,1684,4,"Hilton might need to seriously think of improvement, service and infrastructure....",2015-04-25
1,1685,1,"Hilton Tokyo Shinjuku is located just 10 min walk from Shinjuku station, hotel has a free shuttle service that start working at 8:00 am.",2015-04-25
1,1685,2,"I got a executive Junior suite at fl 38, giving excellent view over the area, breakfast was a bit boring but still good and as always I comment about food it will depend on your own preference but you will find a eggs station, asian and western food.",2015-04-25
1,1685,3,"AS typically in JApan, service is excellent, people do the real effort to do their job the right way.",2015-04-25
1,1685,4,"Only precaution is that not to much people understand English, then if you don't speak Japanese, be prepared with your printed phrases or as work for you.",2015-04-25
1,1685,5,"I mentioned about the shuttle service starting at 8:00 am for you to be careful that if you need to go to Narita Airport around 10:00 am, you will need to take a taxi(~ 800 Yen)",2015-04-25
1,1685,6,My wife and kids use the indoor pool and they said it was really nice and temperature was perfect.,2015-04-25
1,1685,7,"As usual, Hilton did not disappoint me.",2015-04-25

1,1686,1,We are a family of 3 adults plus two toddlers.,2015-04-25
1,1686,2,Stayed for 4 nights ( first 2 nights in King executive room n last 2 nights in King city view executive room ) our preferred choice is actually the King city view room which is much bigger n comes with a separate living area.,2015-04-25
1,1686,3,"However, as the hotel is fully booked during our stay, thus the reason why we need to book two different category of room.",2015-04-25
1,1686,4,Service was excellent from the moment u step out of the airport limousine bus ( yes it stop directly infront of the hotel entrance ) the bellboy was already on standby to help with our luggages..,2015-04-25
1,1686,5,Executive rooms check in was supposed to be on the 37th floor but nothing was mentioned in the email confirmation.,2015-04-25
1,1686,6,"Anyway, the lady at the front.",2015-04-25
1,1686,7,Desk was very helpful too.,2015-04-25
1,1686,8,"While waiting to be check in, my elder boy fell and knocked his head against the floor..without us requesting, the lady who is attending to us quickly went and took an ice bag for my boy.",2015-04-25
1,1686,9,This is what we call service and goin g the extra mile for your guest!,2015-04-25
1,1686,10,"As we stayed on both 37th n 38th floor respectively, views was spectacular.",2015-04-25
1,1686,11,"Both rooms were clean and simple, nothing fanciful..breakfast at executive lounge was ok with limited selections ( we choose to ate at the main restaurant instead with more variety ) they also serve pre dinner canapés n drinks which is a bonus if you are back at hotel early.",2015-04-25
1,1686,12,Go for the executive room if you can afford it.,2015-04-25
1,1686,13,"Location wise, I wouldn't give it a five stars even though there is actually a subway linked to the hotel ( is a pretty long walk to the station and it can be tiring walking to and fro esp after a long day out ) there do provide hotel shuttle to shin juku area but do note the last bus back to hotel is at 2140..",2015-04-25
1,1686,14,"If you missed it, the cab fare from shin juku is around 730 yen.",2015-04-25
1,1687,1,"Stayed for a week, and loved every minute of it - although who has time to stay at the hotel when in Tokyo?",2015-04-24
1,1687,2,"Centrally located close to Shinjuku station (about a ten minute walk, although the hotel has a shuttle if needed) and with a subway station available through a 400 meter long underground tunnel, the hotel is accessible in several ways - including direct bus service from Narita (Friendly Airport Limousine).",2015-04-24
1,1687,3,The breakfast was impressive and the hotel staff really made the whole experience something to remember.,2015-04-24
1,1687,4,"We'll be back next time we're in Tokyo, and I have no problem recommending this hotel to anyone travelling to Tokyo!",2015-04-24
1,1688,1,Everyone is so polite and wants to help !,2015-04-24
1,1688,2,Amazing !,2015-04-24
1,1688,3,"The hotel is cool, clean , always full , nice and well located but like all Tokyo , not everyone speaks English so is complicated.",2015-04-24
1,1688,4,Also in the breakfast we got the impression that the lady always wanted to sit us kinda far because we are younger and maybe not dressed as chic as most ( sportswear ) .,2015-04-24
1,1689,1,Stayed for 4 nights & was upgraded to the executive 38th floor ,2015-04-23
1,1689,2,Spectacular views in a newly renovated room,2015-04-23
1,1689,3,All furnishings & fittings are 5 star quality & bed was excellent,2015-04-23

1,1689,5,Breakfast can be a bit chaotic on busy mornings,2015-04-23
1,1689,6,Have to pay for room wifi,2015-04-23
1,1690,1,Long term favourite hotel of mine for business trips to Tokyo.,2015-04-23
1,1690,2,Especially the newly designed Executive rooms are outstanding.,2015-04-23
1,1690,3,And the staff is absolutely excellent and always very friendly.,2015-04-23
1,1690,4,"This time stayed in a Deluxe category room, which is not as modern as the Exec rooms but still very well appointed and comfortable.",2015-04-23
1,1690,5,Good size with ample opportunity also to work on the large glass workdesk.,2015-04-23
1,1690,6,I do however have one observation that slightly reduces my opinion about this hotel.,2015-04-23
1,1690,7,There appear to be more and more large tourist groups which make the hotel loose some of its appeal.,2015-04-23
1,1690,8,"Not only because of the crowded feel in the lobby and at breakfast, but also because of the behaviour of some of these groups.",2015-04-23
1,1690,9,(Maybe Hilton has acquired Nikko Tokyo in the Odaiba area to have that become more of a tourist offering and allow the Hilton in Shinjuku to again became a primary business location.),2015-04-23
1,1690,10,"The tourists groups may also be the reason behind the impression that the breakfast in main restaurant (Lobby) seems to have less variety / class, and the breakfast offering in the Exec Lounge has been upgraded.",2015-04-23
1,1691,1,We choose this hotel because the room are newly renovated and plus the room are quiet large compared with normal hotels in japan.,2015-04-21
1,1691,2,"The breakfast was brilliant and all the staff are very service mind and are ready to help you out , some of the ammentities we request at odd hours , they were able to provide us in 5- 10 minutes time.",2015-04-21
1,1691,3,We really loved the place and would definitely return.,2015-04-21
1,1691,4,"Even though the hotel is a bit of walking distance to JR SHINJUKU STATION, but that is not a problem , they have a shuttle service every 15 minutes to the station.",2015-04-21
1,1691,5,The only cons would be there is NO free wifi in the room.,2015-04-21
1,1692,1,I've stayed at The Hilton Tokyo in Shinjuku twice during the past two weeks.,2015-04-21
1,1692,2,The first time was for three nights immediately after arriving at Narita.,2015-04-21
1,1692,3,A Limousine bus takes you directly from the airport (where you buy your ticket) right to the front door.,2015-04-21
1,1692,4,Couldn't be easier!,2015-04-21
1,1692,5,This is a modern hotel with excellent professional staff who manage to keep things moving swiftly and with ease no matter how crowded it appears to be.,2015-04-21
1,1692,6,My room was on the 38th floor with fantastic views of the city.,2015-04-21
1,1692,7,"It had everything one would expect from a hotel of this caliber (a wonderfully comfortable bed & pillows, good linens, nice bathroom products) but also some much appreciated extra touches such as a coffee machine, sleepwear, slippers and a makeup mirror in the bathroom.",2015-04-21
1,1692,8,"However, there are a couple of things I think they could improve upon, one being the lighting.",2015-04-21
1,1692,9,I found it very dim.,2015-04-21
1,1692,10,And the other would be the wifi.,2015-04-21
1,1692,11,It dropped out constantly AND they charge you for it's use when you are using it from your room!,2015-04-21
1,1692,12,I think this is unreasonable in a world class hotel - and the fact that it didn't work well at that.,2015-04-21
1,1692,13,"They did deduct one 24 hour period from my bill when it barely worked at all, but still, this really isn't good enough.",2015-04-21
1,1692,14,I didn't have breakfast there but there is a wonderful chocolate/pastry shop in the lobby where one can buy a nice croissant or muffin to have with your coffee.,2015-04-21
1,1692,15,There is a free shuttle bus which runs between the hotel and Shinjuku Station regularly and from there one can take advantage of Tokyo's fabulous (and cheap) public transport system.,2015-04-21
1,1692,16,I returned to the Hilton Tokyo for one last night before flying out.,2015-04-21
1,1692,17,"Although my room was the same price as my previous visit, I was a little surprised to find it was significantly smaller (not a huge problem) and that it didn't have a window!",2015-04-21
1,1692,18,"Since I was only there for one night I didn't complain, but I would advise anybody booking to insist upon a room with a window - and hopefully a great view.",2015-04-21
1,1693,1,"For the past four years, my wife & I have celebrated our anniversary in Japan.",2015-04-21
1,1693,2,"Thus, this time we stayed at the Hilton Tokyo to celebrate our anniversary.",2015-04-21
1,1693,3,Encountered some problems at check-in and checkout but I think the root of the problem was the Hilton USA reservation system and not the hotel.,2015-04-21
1,1693,4,"From the moment you walk into the hotel, I knew we chose the right hotel.",2015-04-21
1,1693,5,"The smell, décor and hotel staff smiles said it all.",2015-04-21
1,1693,6,"Stayed in the Executive King and this was just what we were looking for more space, more comfort, and much bigger than those typical hotels in Japan.",2015-04-21
1,1693,7,"As a Hilton Honors Gold member, we had access to the regular Honors lounge, the exclusive Gold & Diamond Honors lounge as well as free breakfast at the wonderful buffet.",2015-04-21
1,1693,8,We do not drink alcohol but in the evening wines and spirits were complimentary.,2015-04-21
1,1693,9,The hors d'oeuvres were great!,2015-04-21
1,1693,10,"I have read other reviews stating the hotel was old, hotel staffs were rude, or it was inconvenient to the JR station.",2015-04-21
1,1693,11,I saw none of this.,2015-04-21
1,1693,12,I feel the Hilton Tokyo was nicer than any Hilton I stayed at.,2015-04-21
1,1693,13,The staffs were not only just professional & polite; they were very sincere in wanting to help make your stay a great experience.,2015-04-21
1,1693,14,The hotel offered a bus shuttle to/from the JR station every 20 minutes and the airport limo stopped right at the hotel.,2015-04-21
1,1693,15,"During our stay, Mr. Tamura, Guest Relations Manager could be seen everywhere in the hotel greeting us and other guests and making sure that everyone was enjoying their stay.",2015-04-21
1,1693,16,I could go on & on how wonderful our stay was or elaborate about the fruits and champagne apology gift but I won’t.,2015-04-21
1,1693,17,"Instead, I will mention one thing that made our hotel stay experience go from wonderful to AWESOME.",2015-04-21
1,1693,18,"As mentioned, I had a problem at checkout.",2015-04-21
1,1693,19,"The hotel could have done nothing AFTER I checked out since after all, I may never return to the hotel again.",2015-04-21
1,1693,20,"To my surprise, I received an email from the Director of Operations, Mr. Cook who asked how my stay was and informed me the problem I had at checkout was corrected and that I would be receiving a refund.",2015-04-21

1,1708,7,"I would definitely recommend upgrading to a room with ""Executive"" benefits as this gives you access to the Executive Lounge, meaning you can drop by whenever during the day for complimentary drinks (soft, tea/coffee, alcoholic) and snacks (mostly fruit), as well as afternoon tea and evening drinks.",2015-04-13
1,1708,8,"Breakfast is offered in the lounge as well, although the hotel also allows you to opt to take your ""Executive"" breakfast in the ground-floor restaurant/bar, which is recommended because you then have access to the full breakfast buffet.",2015-04-13
1,1708,9,"The buffet is plentiful, offering the usual large-hotel breakfast fare, with staff on hand to make espresso-based drinks and egg-based breakfast items (omlets etc).",2015-04-13
1,1708,10,I chose this hotel based on its location (close to Shinjuku) and because I picked up a good rate in a Hilton promotion.,2015-04-13
1,1708,11,I would stay again and would gladly recommend it to friends.,2015-04-13
1,1708,12,"The hotel appears to be a favourite of airline crews and tour groups - so if you are looking for a quiet or boutique hotel experience, the Hilton Tokyo probably isn't for you.",2015-04-13

1,1717,8,Ride to the hotel from Narita was done on the busses that proliferate at the airport.,2015-04-06
1,1717,9,Ride was long and interesting but the seats were soooo tiny.,2015-04-06
1,1717,10,Japanese bus seats were just not made for our North American fat butts!,2015-04-06
1,1717,11,"Anyway, jet lagged and tired, we had a smooth check-in and went straight to our room to pass out.",2015-04-06
1,1717,12,"Room was bigger than we really needed, in fact we never used the couch area at all.",2015-04-06
1,1717,13,"Like I said, we only booked the jr suite because it was cheaper for some odd reason.",2015-04-06
1,1717,14,The view was basically of another building.,2015-04-06
1,1717,15,Bed was fine.,2015-04-06
1,1717,16,Bathroom was nice and had the funky wash-your-butt-for-you technology which was fun.,2015-04-06
1,1717,17,We woke stupidly early the next morning and decided to wander the area.,2015-04-06
1,1717,18,"We strolled down to Kabukicho which is where lots of the things we wanted to see were located (robot show, cat café, etc..).",2015-04-06
1,1717,19,It was a short 15-20 walk and we easily found the places we were looking for although they were still closed at that hour.,2015-04-06
1,1717,20,Found a Starbucks in the Shinjinku station and had fun watching the trains go by with workers faces smushed up against the glass as they were packed in like sardines.,2015-04-06
1,1717,21,We headed back to the hotel for breakfast (included with the executive upgrade) and thoroughly enjoyed the buffet.,2015-04-06
1,1717,22,It had enough of a variety that I had no complaints.,2015-04-06
1,1717,23,Service for coffee and such seemed prompt.,2015-04-06
1,1717,24,We managed at other times during our stay to utilize the club lounge that came with the executive upgrade and that was a pleasant surprise.,2015-04-06
1,1717,25,"While it appeared you could self-serve yourself, there were also wait staff who took drink requests and brought them to you.",2015-04-06
1,1717,26,The view was very nice from there and selection of drinks was more than adequate for our tastes.,2015-04-06
1,1717,27,They had nice snacks as well at times.,2015-04-06
1,1717,28,They had a shuttle to the train station but we just walked to/from as it really wasn't that far.,2015-04-06
1,1717,29,Perhaps the best thing I can say about the hotel happened near the end of our stay.,2015-04-06
1,1717,30,My wife and I had purchased some jewelry while on a tour the previous day in Asakusa (other side of town) at a store that only spoke japanese.,2015-04-06
1,1717,31,We discovered that the jewelry would not be allowed back into our country (Canada) as it was on a prohibited list so we wanted to return it.,2015-04-06
1,1717,32,"We explained our dilemma to the concierge and she contacted the store, explained the situation and arranged for us to return the item.",2015-04-06
1,1717,33,She gave the taxi driver instructions on where exactly we needed to go and upon getting to the store the clerk had our refund money ready for us in an envelope which he handed over after examining the item being returned.,2015-04-06
1,1717,34,It was a costly mistake for us as the taxi was expensive but it was far less than the cost of the jewelry and we absolutely could not have pulled off the return of it without the considerable help of the concierge.,2015-04-06
1,1717,35,Sadly the time we wasted on returning the jewelry ate up our last day of sightseeing before we had to scoot off to our cruise ship in Yokohama.,2015-04-06
1,1717,36,"I loved Japan so much, I've been itching to go back and we have finally decided to return next year.",2015-04-06
1,1717,37,I wanted to find a nice hotel that was a bit closer to the other areas we haven't seen yet so we could avoid using the trains as they are a bit daunting (at least Shinjuku station was) but after much research I find myself being drawn back to this hotel despite its location being less than ideal for us.,2015-04-06
1,1717,38,Simply the value is just too great.,2015-04-06
1,1717,39,Most of the nice hotels I can find where I'd feel comfortable are very expensive (like $600-$800 a night) whereas this hotel is about half that.,2015-04-06
1,1717,40,"When I was there, our friends who were cruising with us stayed at the Shangri'la Hotel (one of those $800/night places) and we went there to meet them one night for supper and I could say that I could tell it was classier for sure.",2015-04-06
1,1717,41,The staff bowed deeper and the service was a notch above too.,2015-04-06
1,1717,42,My friend left her MS medicine on the bus from the airport and she appealed to the concierge there for help.,2015-04-06
1,1717,43,"They called the company, located the bag and had it held for pickup, then one of the hotel staff ACCOMPANIED my friend in the taxi to ensure everything went smoothly.",2015-04-06
1,1717,44,"That is wow service, and certainly above and beyond what I would reasonably expect any hotel to do.",2015-04-06
1,1717,45,On the other hand this hotel (Hilton) provided adequate and helpful service for my own crisis and I paid $800 less than my friend for the same 2 nights.,2015-04-06
1,1717,46,My upcoming stay will be 3 nights.,2015-04-06
1,1717,47,"I could stay at a ""wow, whiz bang service"" place walking distance to the attractions I want to see for $2400 or this ""pretty damn good"" hotel $1200 knowing I'll need to spend a bit on taxi's.",2015-04-06
1,1717,48,"For me, I've decided the value of this place is just too good to pass up, plus I know I'll like it.",2015-04-06
1,1717,49,"For you other folks out there, reading and researching a place, I'd say that if you're looking at checking out Kabukicho, this is an ideal hotel that has service far above any Hilton, Sheraton, Marriott, etc..",2015-04-06
1,1717,50,you'd find back in the US or Canada.,2015-04-06
1,1717,51,Wifi worked flawlessly.,2015-04-06
1,1717,52,Food that we had was good.,2015-04-06
1,1717,53,(we didn't use room service this time).,2015-04-06
1,1717,54,"Club lounge was the best I've ever had in a hotel (not that I've had many, but I've had some).",2015-04-06
1,1718,1,"Hilton Tokyo is a great hotel in Shinjuku -- the staff is very friendly, and the rooms are a decent size for Tokyo.",2015-04-04
1,1718,2,Bed was quite comfortable and the shower was nice as well.,2015-04-04
1,1718,3,"I requested a ""standby"" upgraded room, and I would not recommend it.",2015-04-04
1,1718,4,"The view we got was OK, and the room size upgrade was not impressive -- it's not worth the extra $25 per day.",2015-04-04
1,1718,5,Breakfast buffet was good but also very expensive (about $35 per person).,2015-04-04
1,1718,6,Internet was also not included - it costs $15 per day.,2015-04-04
1,1719,1,"Great Hotel, excellent service, charming staff, very nice, large, well equipped rooms with very comfortable beds.",2015-04-03
1,1719,2,Breakfast buffet is really good.,2015-04-03
1,1719,3,Easy to get to from both Narita and Hameda airports by direct Airport Limousine bus.,2015-04-03
1,1719,4,The Hotel is about 10 minutes walk away from Shinjuku station but the Hotel also has a shuttle bus which runs every 15 minutes.,2015-04-03
1,1719,5,Really its a good hotel for business and leisure but it gets very full very often so book early.,2015-04-03
1,1719,6,One bad thing...,2015-04-03
1,1719,7,internet in the guest room is not free indeed its quite expensive..,2015-04-03
1,1719,8,"it is free in the lobby however so the lobby is always, always cluttered and hard to navigate with so many people on their lap tops and mobile phones....",2015-04-03
1,1719,9,its petty silly really.,2015-04-03
1,1720,1,Have stayed at this hotel 3x in the last year and half.,2015-04-03
1,1720,2,Service is awesome and rooms are on the large side when compared to typical Japanese hotels.,2015-04-03
1,1720,3,Have been fortunate to get upgraded to their executive rooms which seem to have been renovated and are always clean.,2015-04-03
1,1720,4,Only complaint is that since this is a large hotel you can usually hear foot traffic outside in the hallways as people walk to their rooms.,2015-04-03
1,1720,5,The breakfast downstairs is phenomenal and has a wide variety catering to most taste buds.,2015-04-03
1,1720,6,Love the fact that the hotel has a shuttle service to the Shinjuku train station which makes it convenient for most travellers.,2015-04-03

1,1722,6,And the breakfast buffet was awesome.,2015-04-01

1,1723,2,"It's reliable, efficient, has a good buffet breakfast, gym and pool.",2015-04-01
1,1723,3,"For the leisure traveller, a hotel closer to the eastern side of Shinjuku station would be better, and to charge for wifi in th room is just plain getting outdated in this day and age.",2015-04-01

1,1795,4,The 2nd floor restaurants are always full even for hotel guests.,2015-02-17

1,1796,1,The Tokyo Hilton is conveniently located within walking distance to Shinjuku (20mins) and Harajuku (a little further) and close to two metro lines that can be reached by underground walkways.,2015-02-16
1,1796,2,It's a great luxurious hotel with all the amenities one would expect.,2015-02-16
1,1796,3,Entering the hotel for the first time I noticed just how busy it is in the lobby.,2015-02-16
1,1796,4,There are numerous check-in desks but still there seemed to be lots of people queuing.,2015-02-16

1,1797,1,We booked for an executive king room with booking.com and requested for smoking room.,2015-02-16
1,1797,2,"Upon check-in, we were told by front desk that there is no smoking room for the room type we booked.",2015-02-16
1,1797,3,We were told that the smoking rooms located only on 34th floor for double and executive junior suites were fully booked.,2015-02-16
1,1797,4,"Having no choice and not to cause a hassle to my husband who is a smoker, we need to opt for standard twin smoking room on 34th floor, i.e. there will be no refund on the amount we pay for the executive king room due to the non-existence room type as mentioned by the front desk.",2015-02-16
1,1797,5,We appreciate the front desk personnel for making an effort in making good of the situation but would like to suggest that specific room details should be made known to third party's agent rather than the guests having to take the stress upon check-in.,2015-02-16
1,1797,6,"We would also like to bring the attention of the door hanger where both sides showed ""Please Do Not Disturb"" instead of ""Clean Up Room"" on the other side.",2015-02-16

1,1800,5,"There is really nothing close to the hotel, although the main part of Shinjuku is walking distance away.",2015-02-11
1,1800,6,There are options on the metro nearby so the rest of Tokyo is accessible.,2015-02-11
1,1801,1,I stayed at this property simply because I am a Hilton Gold member.,2015-02-10
1,1801,2,"I usually don't mind even if I have to pay more at a Hilton property because I know that I will get room upgrades, or other benefits as a Gold member.",2015-02-10
1,1801,3,"But Hilton Tokyo doesn't provide any room upgrade and lounge access for Gold members, both of which are always granted at other Hilton properties without any problem.",2015-02-10
1,1801,4,"I am somewhat disappointed by this, and there is no reason to be loyalty to this hotel chain.",2015-02-10
1,1801,5,I will stay here in the future only if the rate is very competitive.,2015-02-10
1,1802,1,Being my first trip to Japan was daunting.,2015-02-10
1,1802,2,The staff at Hilton treated me in such a way that I felt secured and taken care of.,2015-02-10
1,1802,3,"They tried to inform me of anything I could possibly need which made it so that I did not have to worry about figuring out shuttle times, how to get around, and how to get the things that I needed.",2015-02-10
1,1802,4,I was very happy with my experience and will not consider going anywhere else when going to Japan.,2015-02-10

1,1803,1,"Very quiet and confortable hotel, with excellent prestations .",2015-02-09
1,1803,2,Very convenient location close to Shinjuku Station and well deserved by the hotel shuttle.,2015-02-09
1,1803,3,Excellent for business purpose stay.,2015-02-09
1,1803,4,"Recommended as well for non-business stay, such for couples' romantic stay.",2015-02-09
1,1804,1,The location of this hotel is perfect for a visit to Tokyo as it's about a 10 minute walk to Shinjuku station and the heart of the entertainment district.,2015-02-08
1,1804,2,"The rooms were well appointed although, if you want a bathtub, you may need to request it as we were traveling with another couple and their room had one and ours didn't even though we had the same ""type"" of room.",2015-02-08
1,1804,3,"The bed was ok, if a bit on the hard side.",2015-02-08
1,1804,4,Don't bother with the restaurants in the hotel.,2015-02-08
1,1804,5,We ate at the Chinese one the night we arrived in Tokyo as we were exhausted and just wanted something quick to eat before we went to sleep.,2015-02-08
1,1804,6,The front desk recommended the restaurants in the hotel and the Chinese one was the only one that was even remotely reasonably priced (it was still about $60 pp without alcohol).,2015-02-08
1,1804,7,I don't mind spending money on a good meal but the prices at the restaurants in this hotel were straight up criminal for the quality of food.,2015-02-08
1,1804,8,It really wasn't anything special.,2015-02-08
1,1804,9,The service here was also a little iffy.,2015-02-08
1,1804,10,"I am definitely not one of those people who thinks that everyone in a foreign country should speak English but I will say that after two weeks in Japan, it was a bit surprising that the least proficient staff we encountered was at this hotel.",2015-02-08
1,1804,11,We asked to have our bags forwarded to our next hotel in Hakuba (something very commonly done in Japan) and even though we said that there was a similarly named hotel to the one we were staying at in the area and to be sure that the right hotel address was written down (I gave them the correct hotel name and address) they sent our luggage to the wrong hotel.,2015-02-08
1,1804,12,The concierge also told us it may take us two days to get to Nagano which is crazy considering the train ride is 90 minutes on the Shinkansen.,2015-02-08
1,1804,13,"I guess he was trying to account for bad weather but even so, you'd think if you're giving travel advice you'd want to be at least somewhat accurate (the weather forecast was fine for the day we were supposed to leave).",2015-02-08
1,1804,14,"Lastly, give yourself sufficient time to take the elevator down from your room.",2015-02-08
1,1804,15,Multiple times during our stay the elevators were too full to get on.,2015-02-08
1,1804,16,"Overall, I don't think this would be my first choice to stay for my next visit to Tokyo.",2015-02-08
1,1804,17,The location is great but the lapses in service and the issues with the elevators would me think twice about booking them again.,2015-02-08
1,1805,1,"Located in a very convenient location, and very nice.",2015-02-08
1,1805,2,Several good restaurants are in walking distance.,2015-02-08
1,1805,3,Also the shuttle to Shinjuku Station was a big help.,2015-02-08
1,1805,4,The staff was very helpful and kind.,2015-02-08
1,1805,5,"My only complaint was the room lacked free coffee, but that is more nit-picking than anything.",2015-02-08
1,1805,6,"I would recommend this place for anyone wanting an enjoyable, no-hassle, place to stay in Shinjuku (or Tokyo in general).",2015-02-08
1,1806,1,Booked on basis of location - ideally placed for station - and value for money as Toyko is expensive!,2015-02-08
1,1806,2,Rooms small but quiet and acceptable with comfortable bed.,2015-02-08
1,1806,3,"Bathroom tiny for two, but it was functional.",2015-02-08

1,1806,5,"Staff on the whole good, check in staff on ground floor bit officious, but I don't think they mean anything by it.",2015-02-08
1,1806,6,Concierge very helpful in sending off documents and directions.,2015-02-08
1,1806,7,Would stay again,2015-02-08
1,1807,1,"This is our forth day, two more nights and onto HK before returning home.",2015-02-07
1,1807,2,It's been sometime since I stayed at any Hilton hotel.,2015-02-07
1,1807,3,"In other countries, I've stayed at the Mandarin, Fourseasons and others.",2015-02-07
1,1807,4,My family want to thank all the executive lounge staff for making us feel so welcome!,2015-02-07

1,1811,1,We wanted to upgrade to an executive room so we'd have a good view.,2015-01-29
1,1811,2,None of the executive rooms were available so we were put on the 20th floor.,2015-01-29
1,1811,3,The room was large and the view was ok.,2015-01-29

1,1811,6,"I did, however, get bus sick on the way to the airport.",2015-01-29
1,1811,7,The Hilton is the last stop for the airport limo so there's not much choice for seats.,2015-01-29
1,1811,8,The Hilton was predictable and our only surprise was how unpredictable the concierge desk was.,2015-01-29
1,1811,9,Several of the staff seemed to dislike their job and our questions irritated them.,2015-01-29
1,1811,10,After the excellent service in Kyoto at the Granvia Hotel we were unpleasantly surprised by Hilton.,2015-01-29

1,1812,5,Rooms were very decent sized for Tokyo and the hotel very well maintained.,2015-01-28
1,1812,6,So why the but...,2015-01-28
1,1812,7,On the day of departure there was a really dour looking lady working on the computer at the concierge when we approached her to pass her our tickets for the airport express.,2015-01-28
1,1812,8,She wasn't very approachable at all.,2015-01-28
1,1812,9,Maybe she wasn't a staff of the concierge.,2015-01-28
1,1812,10,"Luckily for us, another much nicer staff approached us very quickly and helped us instead.",2015-01-28
1,1812,11,"This is unpleasant staff, of course, is highly atypical of Hilton, or for that matter, any staff working in Japan.",2015-01-28
1,1812,12,So sometimes a small unpleasant experience can affect the whole impression of an otherwise really good place.,2015-01-28
1,1813,1,"Great location with the direct availability of the Airport Limosine Bus. From the hotel, it is easy to travel within Tokyo as there is a direct Metro station from the basement and the free shuttle bus to ShinJuku Station.",2015-01-27
1,1813,2,Nice view of you get the top floors and the size of the rooms are pretty decent.,2015-01-27
1,1813,3,My only negative experience was the Concierge Desk who were not too friendly and doesn't seem keen to provide services to others.,2015-01-27
1,1813,4,This is in total contrast to the check-in desks who are prompt and professional with their services which is a kudos to the hotel.,2015-01-27
1,1814,1,Firstly the cons:,2015-01-27
1,1814,2,The lobby are constantly packed with people from guests to visitors.,2015-01-27
1,1814,3,The hotel clearly cater more towards tour packages from china and taiwan.,2015-01-27
1,1814,4,I have also seen airline staff from singapore airlines and another european airline(I think it is lufthansa).,2015-01-27
1,1814,5,Can't really say much about the service as I have received none.,2015-01-27
1,1814,6,I had some china tourist who tried jumping the queue which annoyed me.,2015-01-27

1,1816,7,Views across the city from the lounge were outstaning.,2015-01-27
1,1816,8,The onLy minor drawback was and extremely busy lobby but this was probably because the hotel was very busy.,2015-01-27

1,1818,4,"Yes, the room was bigger and the bed very very comfy, we were surprised by the distinct lack of WiFi in our room and the lack of complimentary items.",2015-01-27
1,1818,5,"In the other places we have stayed-these are standard-even in the capsule hotels, WiFi is complimentary!!!",2015-01-27

1,1818,7,It's also not very private.,2015-01-27
1,1818,8,Everything in this hotel is incredibly expensive and is no better than anywhere else we stayed.,2015-01-27
1,1818,9,"Whilst I understand The Hilton has a good reputation and basically rides on its name, we felt the hotel needed massive updating, better facilities and to be honest rethink your ridiculous pricing!",2015-01-27
1,1818,10,"We also found that whilst your front of house spoke good English, the rest of the staff didn't and we found that a problem when the kettle broke in our room.",2015-01-27

1,1822,2,The service was reasonable and the guest facilities and restaurants well looked after.,2015-01-21
1,1822,3,Beware visiting at New Year.,2015-01-21

1,1823,1,"Over a period of many years, on many occasions, I've stayed in the Hilton Tokyo.",2015-01-21

1,1823,4,The upper suite-style rooms are spacious even on Japanese terms.,2015-01-21

1,1823,6,Just about every kind of food available in Japan can be found within 10 minutes walk with a lot more just beyond.,2015-01-21

1,1825,6,Convenient location.,2015-01-18
1,1825,7,I had the hotel arrange a private taxi with English speaking driver for me to tour rather than go on group tour.,2015-01-18
1,1825,8,It is much more expensive than bus tour but worth every dollar!,2015-01-18
1,1825,9,I had the car for 9 hours and saw everything I wanted and more.,2015-01-18
1,1825,10,Didn't feel rushed and the driver offered to take me other places which was great.,2015-01-18
1,1825,11,If you're not on a budget I suggest hiring a taxi.,2015-01-18
1,1825,12,The only concern I had with the hotel was the cost of food.,2015-01-18

1,1825,16,No this was not room service...,2015-01-18
1,1825,17,This was in the lounge on first floor.,2015-01-18
1,1825,18,I don't mind paying for a good meal but this was expensive and to top it off it was not good.,2015-01-18
1,1825,19,I had a friend that ordered separately....,2015-01-18
1,1825,20,pizza...,2015-01-18
1,1825,21,and she said it was also pricey and not that great.,2015-01-18
1,1825,22,I had breakfast at Dennys at the corner everyday and it was worth it.,2015-01-18
1,1825,23,Overall I wish I could give a 4.5...,2015-01-18
1,1825,24,I would definitely stay there again.,2015-01-18

1,1826,2,Just beautiful rooms.,2015-01-18
1,1826,3,Breakfast buffet is expensive but is amazing.,2015-01-18
1,1826,4,"If buffet is not included in your rate, it gets a bit confusing for the staff as each morning we had to ask for the bill and had to stress that we only had the continental breakfast.",2015-01-18
1,1826,5,But loved the staff and the feel of the place.,2015-01-18
1,1826,6,I do hope we can stay here again.,2015-01-18
1,1826,7,Very close to the Shinjuku train station.,2015-01-18
1,1826,8,The Japanese bath in the fitness center was definitely a different cultural experience!,2015-01-18
1,1827,1,"have just finished a three night stay at Tokyo Hilton, overall still impressive but breakfast size and variety reduced since last stay and check in and out still very, very slow, need to address this.",2015-01-17
1,1827,2,"Rooms ok, not 100% sold on new decor but just my option",2015-01-17
1,1828,1,I stay at the Hilton family of hotels a lot - this one is very nice!,2015-01-15
1,1828,2,We had 2 nights in Tokyo and found this location to be great for what we were doing.,2015-01-15
1,1828,3,They are within walking distance from the Shinjuku station but it was very easy to take the Hilton shuttle which runs every 20 minutes.,2015-01-15
1,1828,4,We took the Limo Bus from Narita which drops you off at the front door to the hotel.,2015-01-15

1,1829,4,I particularly enjoyed the gym and spa.,2015-01-15
1,1829,5,The service was great.,2015-01-15
1,1829,6,The attendants were always welcoming and quite helpful.,2015-01-15
1,1829,7,"The next time I come, I'll definitely get a massage.",2015-01-15
1,1829,8,"I'm sure that will be great, too.",2015-01-15
1,1829,9,"I totally recommend this hotel for business or holiday, just leave your children at home.",2015-01-15
1,1830,1,We arrived via the Hilton courtesy bus from Shinjuku station.,2015-01-14
1,1830,2,Our suitcases were taken from us and we were deposited into a lift to the 37th floor to check-in in the executive lounge.,2015-01-14
1,1830,3,Our greeting at the lounge was warm and genuine and we were invited to sit on a sofa during the formalities.,2015-01-14
1,1830,4,Our e-standby upgrade request was honoured and thus room changed from my booked Executive Double to a Junior Executive Suite - and at a very reasonable cost too.,2015-01-14
1,1830,5,"It was now 10:00, 4 hours before the earliest check-in, yet to our enormous gratitude we were invited to check into our room immediately.",2015-01-14
1,1830,6,"I was aware that a package had been left at the hotel reception for me the previous day, from my Mum, who was a guest at another local hotel.",2015-01-14
1,1830,7,The package was delivered - without any prompting from me - moments after we checked in.,2015-01-14
1,1830,8,We had occasion to visit the Executive lounge several times during our 4 night stay.,2015-01-14
1,1830,9,Each time we were greeted warmly and remembered by the staff (which was appreciated as it avoided us ever having to 'prove' our status by showing the room key sleeve).,2015-01-14
1,1830,10,"To me, the above demonstrates perfect attention to detail by the team there.",2015-01-14
1,1830,11,"Despite being young and casually dressed (this was a holiday, not business), we were treated equally as well as all other patrons.",2015-01-14
1,1830,12,"I cannot speak highly enough of the service provided by the entire Exec lounge staff, absolutely flawless, pre-emptive, and courteous.",2015-01-14
1,1830,13,Our Junior Suite prompted mixed feelings.,2015-01-14
1,1830,14,"The space was fantastic, particularly by Tokyo standards, and the decor modern and minimalist.",2015-01-14
1,1830,15,"We appreciated the Nespresso machine, iPhone dock and the free wi-fi.",2015-01-14
1,1830,16,"Although the wi-fi worked well, I thought it odd that it only allowed us to connect three devices for free, though to the hotels credit, this problem was fixed immediately by a call to guest services who provided me with a complimentary pass-code for more devices (as a couple we carry a mobile phone each, a work mobile each, an ipad each and potentially a laptop each...",2015-01-14
1,1830,17,"this is fairly standard I expect, so a limit of three devices is baffling).",2015-01-14
1,1830,18,"My constructive feedback on the suite, however, is that the bathroom is shamefully small in a room of that size.",2015-01-14
1,1830,19,"To give you an idea of how small I mean, it is no exaggeration to tell you that unless you are rather slim you will not be able to open the shower door if the bathroom door is closed.",2015-01-14
1,1830,20,Once inside the shower cubicle you find it is 'wet room' style.,2015-01-14
1,1830,21,"A nice idea, and it looks great, but the determination to squeeze both a bathtub and a shower area in results in a bathtub that is too small to relax in, and a shower whose water flow mostly falls inside the bathtub rather than the shower pan.",2015-01-14
1,1830,22,A really poor design which is frustrating to use and defines the phrase 'style over substance'!,2015-01-14
1,1830,23,"Back to the positives, and I'm pleased to say the bed was huge and comfortable, and despite our ultra-last minute room change at check in, our pre-ordered pillow menu requests still reached the new room before we did - kudos to the excellent housekeeping team.",2015-01-14
1,1830,24,Breakfast was very nice.,2015-01-14
1,1830,25,We chose to dine in the Marble lounge each morning so cannot comment on the light breakfast served in the Exec lounge.,2015-01-14
1,1830,26,"Although the choice of both Western and Eastern breakfasts was fairly extensive, it did not change at all during our 4 mornings there.",2015-01-14
1,1830,27,What was exciting on morning one became dull by morning 4.,2015-01-14
1,1830,28,"The wait staff, whilst lovely, are painfully slow to serve coffee - which I notice has been picked up by previous reviewers - and is perhaps an area for the restaurant management to focus on, and the only English newspaper available is the FT - which is perhaps a tad heavy going whilst on holiday!",2015-01-14
1,1830,29,"Besides that, the restaurant itself is beautifully appointed and very comfortable.",2015-01-14
1,1830,30,"Overall, this was an excellent experience.",2015-01-14
1,1830,31,"We would not hesitate to return, and indeed I am sure we will.",2015-01-14
1,1830,32,"With the possible exception of one stern, grumpy egg chef, each and every other staff member we encountered is an absolute credit to the hotel, and made our stay unforgettable for all the right reasons.",2015-01-14
1,1830,33,Thank you Hilton for a great stay.,2015-01-14
1,1831,1,"Other than the great rate I get, the Hilton is still my favorite hotel in Tokyo.",2015-01-12
1,1831,2,The new refurbished rooms are nice and stylish.,2015-01-12
1,1831,3,"Though the size of the room is not the best, the new rooms are great and really makes the experience different and refreshing.",2015-01-12
1,1831,4,"The lounge team recognizes how busy things can be and reserved another room for Diamond members, which is a nice touch.",2015-01-12

1,1854,5,"You will be charged 1700yen a day to get WiFi in your room, this is clearly not something I would have expected in 2015!",2014-12-28

1,1856,13,Overall:,2014-12-28

1,1861,11,You can see the staff really didn't care.,2014-12-19
1,1861,12,A decision has been that this location is going after the large tourist off the bus trade and ignore the business traveler.,2014-12-19

1,1880,8,So confusing!,2014-12-08
1,1880,9,"This continued with other examples (coin laundry, museums, Shinkansen schedule, etc.), and this detracted from our experience because we lost time and were frustrated at times.",2014-12-08

1,1883,8,Again..,2014-12-06
1,1883,9,Staff to smooth the traffic during that time or advise those guests to WALK to 2/F is much better as in house guests can't get into the lift at all...,2014-12-06

1,1922,6,we sent our 20kgs luggage through Hilton to the hotel in Kyoto for 2000 yen.,2014-11-05
1,1922,7,The most well spent 2000 yen ever saving us the hassle of dragging the luggages everywhere.,2014-11-05
1,1922,8,"Location wise, it's not the best location as it's located in west shinjuku, about 30 mins walk from shinjuku station and 10 mins walk from nishishinjuku station.",2014-11-05
1,1922,9,"For me it's ok as I didn't have tight schedule, but for other people with massive luggages and need to get around much it could be quite a hassle, especially during peak hour or on a rainy day.",2014-11-05
1,1922,10,However they do have the shuttle service to and fro shinjuku station if you don't like too much walking.,2014-11-05
1,1922,11,A slight dissatisfaction from me would be the absence of free drinking bottled water.,2014-11-05
1,1922,12,Not sure if it's because of the fact that I booked through a third party agent or it's just the norm of this hotel.,2014-11-05
1,1922,13,"All in all, it's still the luxurious Hilton hotel that we have always known.",2014-11-05
1,1922,14,Will definitely stay here again the next time I am here.,2014-11-05

1,1923,6,The hotel is located between two metro lines.,2014-11-05

1,1923,8,The travellators that lead to the metro station are not in operation.,2014-11-05
1,1923,9,I am not sure if its this way all year round.,2014-11-05

1,1925,2,"The location isn't great, I think it's more for business travellers visiting local companies: it's on a couple of transit lines which will get you anywhere in Tokyo, but there's nothing really close by (except for a bit of Shinjuku's bright lights, 10/15 minutes walk away).",2014-11-03
1,1925,3,"I would say it's over-priced for what you get, especially since everything has an extra charge, e.g. wi-fi and water, so only book if you get a good deal.",2014-11-03
1,1925,4,"I stayed for $100/night with a corporate account, which is excellent value for Tokyo.",2014-11-03

1,1928,8,We preferred to take the subway from Shinjuku Nishi station (it's closer to the hotel) because it was way less chaotic than the Shinjuku station.,2014-11-02

1,1972,2,"Having been highly impressed with the Hilton Tokyo Bay, we were dissapointed with Hilton Tokyo.",2014-10-03
1,1972,3,"Service was impersonal, no acknowledgement of Hilton Gold Honours membership (through dedicated check-in or breakfast queues), slow and long lines at check-in, inconvenient location meaning you had to rely on the shuttle bus to get to Shinjuku Station which was always crowded and meant you had to line up at least 15 mins earlier to get on the bus and the beds were too hard (I woke up with a sore back!).",2014-10-03
1,1973,1,We stayed for 2 nights at this hotel and got an upgrade to the executive floor.,2014-10-01
1,1973,2,"The service at this hotel was absolutely flawless, and easily the best we have encountered.",2014-10-01
1,1973,3,"All the staff were super accommodating, helpful, and friendly.",2014-10-01

1,1973,5,You have to take the Marunouchi subway and get off at the Nishi Shinjuku station and walk a couple of minutes from there to the hotel.,2014-10-01
1,1973,6,"However, the hotel has a shuttle bus to Shinjuku station, which is super convenient (the cab ride from the hotel to Shinjuku station costs 730 yen).",2014-10-01
1,1973,7,"The shuttle departs from the hotel three times every hour (12, 32, and 52 minutes past the hour) and run until 9 pm.",2014-10-01

1,1973,12,Would love to come back again!!,2014-10-01
1,1974,1,I had been monitoring the reviews of this hotel for months prior to visit with them and now it's time for me to weigh in myself as I have quite a story to tell.,2014-10-01
1,1974,2,"My wife and I stayed at this property for 3 nights, 4 days at the end of September.",2014-10-01
1,1974,3,"We had booked an advanced reservation for 2 nights, 3 days initially, but we ended up extending our stay which required an additional reservation for the extra night.",2014-10-01
1,1974,4,"For both reservations, we chose to put in requests for eStandby upgrades, which some of the readers might be familiar with.",2014-10-01
1,1974,5,"In any case, when we arrived at the hotel for check-in, we were informed that we had been upgraded from our King Jr. Executive suite to the King Tower Suite.",2014-10-01
1,1974,6,So far so good.,2014-10-01
1,1974,7,"So when we asked about how the Executive lounge and free Wi-Fi worked, we were told that this was not an Executive level package.",2014-10-01
1,1974,8,I asked the gentleman to re-check the reservation as I was certain that we had booked an Executive level suite.,2014-10-01
1,1974,9,"He did so, but again re-stated that this was not an Executive suite.",2014-10-01
1,1974,10,"At this point, I said that we were going to decline the room upgrade in that case and go with our original reservation, which I knew to be Executive-level.",2014-10-01
1,1974,11,"He said that, unfortunately, there were no rooms available for our original reservation and that we would have to take the ""upgraded"" room.",2014-10-01
1,1974,12,No mention was ever made about the fact that I had chosen numerous eStandby upgrades but was never given the choice of any.,2014-10-01
1,1974,13,"At this point, I was feeling fatigued from a long Shinkansen ride from Kyoto and I didn't have the strength to argue any further (plus it seemed like a very inappropriate thing to do in Japan), plus I wanted to double-check my reservation details privately to ensure that I hadn't made a mistake.",2014-10-01
1,1974,14,They did offer me a slight discount on Wi-Fi and breakfast that I reluctantly took.,2014-10-01
1,1974,15,"Once we got to the suite, I found myself quite impressed with it despite being rather upset about check-in.",2014-10-01
1,1974,16,So I immediately setup my laptop and starting looking into what had happened with my reservation.,2014-10-01
1,1974,17,"Strangely, when I looked up my original reservation, I could only see the confirmation number but it would not allow me to view the details of the reservation (I had done so numerous times in the past without problem which is why it was so strange); the details of the second reservation came up fine though.",2014-10-01
1,1974,18,"After reviewing what I could, I was no closer to an answer than when I started, so I found myself looking at the desk which had a generalized letter welcoming us to the Hilton and at the end of the letter it stated to contact them about any issues that might make our trip better.",2014-10-01
1,1974,19,"At this point, I realized that this was going to be a sour part of our trip unless I spoke out about it, plus I remembered reading replies from the hotel on this very message board where they stated that they wished people would've contacted them about issues when they still had a chance to make it right for them.",2014-10-01
1,1974,20,So I wrote up a relatively long email explaining the issues I had encountered at check-in and just decided to leave it in their hands while we went out to run some errands.,2014-10-01
1,1974,21,"Once we returned, we noticed a letter under the door.",2014-10-01
1,1974,22,"As we took it into the room, we further noticed a fruit arrangement on the table as well.",2014-10-01
1,1974,23,The letter was the welcome letter to the Executive level that we assumed each member receives at check-in.,2014-10-01
1,1974,24,"No other messages were left, so I figured that they had replied to my e-mail.",2014-10-01
1,1974,25,"Sure enough, when I booted up my laptop, I had a lengthy response from the Reception Manager.",2014-10-01
1,1974,26,He deeply apologized for the issues we encountered at check-in and assured us that this was not representative of the service normally offered by the Hilton.,2014-10-01
1,1974,27,"He further stated that he had pulled our records for eStandby and found that of the 3 requested upgrades we selected, 2 of them were for Executive level, and the one that was not, was the one that was given to us.",2014-10-01
1,1974,28,"Apparently, this was incorrect as alternatives should have been made available to us, but weren't.",2014-10-01
1,1974,29,"In any case, the hotel waived the room upgrade charges for the remaining days, cleared the bill of breakfast/Wi-Fi charges as we were Executive now, and offered us discounts on hotel services such as laundry.",2014-10-01
1,1974,30,We were in awe of such service as nothing like this has EVER been offered to us in the past at any hotel chain.,2014-10-01
1,1974,31,"2 nights later, the hotel also formally recognized my wife's birthday with some goodies that were a total surprise.",2014-10-01
1,1974,32,"No one likes to have issues with checking into a hotel; however, I am sure glad that I spoke up about it because I truly believe that the Hilton Tokyo hotel more than made up for the issues we encountered.",2014-10-01
1,1974,33,"Even before we checked into the hotel, we were already experiencing their wonderful hospitality thanks to a member of their Concierge team by the name of Ayako Nakamura.",2014-10-01
1,1974,34,Nakamura-san had arranged for some professional photos that we took in Kyoto to be shipped to the hotel and then later forwarded to our US address when it was discovered that the photo studio could not ship the finished hardcover book to the US directly.,2014-10-01
1,1974,35,"This kind of customer service was inspiring and served as a reminder just how different hotels in the US are compared to those in Japan, where people bend over backwards to help out complete strangers everyday.",2014-10-01
1,1974,36,"Finally, I must thank Mr. Fan and Mr. Ogura for helping us work through our issues and providing us with an experience that we are still frankly in awe of.",2014-10-01
1,1974,37,We feel as though we made friends in the both of you and hope to see you during a future visit.,2014-10-01
1,1974,38,"For the readers who managed to make it this far, Hilton Tokyo is the real deal.",2014-10-01
1,1974,39,"It is a clean, modern hotel that has an amazing staff that is literally waiting to help make your stay better in any way that they can.",2014-10-01
1,1974,40,"If you can learn one thing from my experience, I would hope that it is to speak up about issues that the hotel can help you with.",2014-10-01
1,1974,41,"Don't just run to TripAdvisor or any other site to bash the hotel, but instead, I would encourage you to give them the opportunity to fix the problem as they did for us.",2014-10-01
1,1974,42,We can't wait to stay at Hilton Tokyo again!,2014-10-01

1,1975,5,Service at the hotel was efficient and super friendly.,2014-09-30

1,1975,10,"All in all, I would stay there again.",2014-09-30
1,1976,1,Located more in the CBD area of Shinjuku its about a 15min walk to the main train station of Shinjuku and the shopping area.However theres a subway station about 5mins walk away and is connected by an underground walkway from next to the hotel`s shuttle bus stop.Hotel shuttle bus runs every 20mins from morning to night stopping at the Odakyu Department store next to the airport limousine..Right next door to the hotel is a hospital and very tall office blocks in the surrounding vicinity.Behind is a big park and opposite is the Hyatt Hotel.There is a Dennys behind and a few more restaurants on the way to Shinjuku station.,2014-09-28
1,1976,2,The airport limousine bus from Haneda and Narita drops and picks passengers up from the hotel so its easy access to both airports.Tickets can be bought at the Concierge.Bags unloaded from the bus by the porters but no assistance offered to transport your bags to the reception or room..Cozy average size lobby with the lobby cafe to the right as you enter.Checkin swift and polite and typical Japanese businesslike efficency.,2014-09-28
1,1976,3,Rooms have been renovated so its very new bright and clean.Decor is modern black white and beige.The twin beds that i had were one of the smallest beds i have ever slept in a hotel.I just barely fit into them.Size of room is average with all the usual amenities provided.Theres a red lounger that immediately catches your eyes as you enter because its such a contrast to the decor of the room.,2014-09-28
1,1976,4,Toilet again is brand spanking new so you can see and feel how clean and shiny everything is.Like all other Hiltons...you are supplied with nice Peter Thomas Roth toiletries.,2014-09-28
1,1976,5,Internet as usual is chargeable at 1700yen a day but is free in the lobby.Remember this is Japan so everything is expensive.If you decide to have breakfast in bed it will cost you a whopping 3500yen for an american breakfast..which doesnt include taxes.The only good thing is you dont have to worry about how much to tip as there is no tipping.,2014-09-28
1,1977,1,"This was my first stay at Hilton Tokyo and I was pleasantly surprised with the nicely updated rooms which have a chic, modern appearance, and the friendly service.",2014-09-28

1,1982,2,The place used to be nowhere near to get trains without 15 minutes walk at least.,2014-09-25
1,1982,3,Now I figured that there are couple of choices to get subway on top of taxi and limo.,2014-09-25
1,1983,1,Spent a night there in the early of Sept prior to catch a flight back home the next day.,2014-09-23

1,1985,1,"Newly renovated rooms are always great way to go in any hotel & the room we booked was modern, functional & very comfy.",2014-09-20
1,1985,2,Add a buffet breakfast (with a coffee/espresso bar) that rivals any US one & you get some smiling guests every morning!,2014-09-20
1,1985,3,"Staff was always polite & helpful, as are the staff in any Japanese hotel.",2014-09-20
1,1985,4,"Just as The south in America is known for its hospitality, you can expect the same in Japan.",2014-09-20
1,1985,5,A great bonus we found was a shuttle that takes you to the largest subway station in the area (which makes it easy for those coming from the airport (which will cost you 100US in a taxi) & we used it often.,2014-09-20
1,1985,6,"There is also an airport shuttle bus that will cost you way less, but it stops after 10 I believe & no reservations are needed from the airport & will cost you around 15US.",2014-09-20
1,1985,7,"Going back, however, reservations are needed & can be made at the concierge desk.",2014-09-20
1,1985,8,Umbrellas are found all over the area & seemed to be stocked for all those needing them.,2014-09-20
1,1985,9,"When you no longer need it, leave it in the nearest stand.",2014-09-20
1,1985,10,"Shopping abounds where the shuttle takes you, as are places other than the hotel to eat.",2014-09-20
1,1985,11,"There is also a huge electronics (camera/computer) store there, which made my husband smile.",2014-09-20
1,1985,12,A tiny Starbucks for me near it & we were both happy!,2014-09-20
1,1986,1,I recently stayed here for a little over 1 week.,2014-09-17
1,1986,2,"During that time I was fortunate to be up-up-upgraded to the Tower Suite - an impressive suite with a bed wider than long, dual bathrooms, and a lounge area 3 times larger than the bedroom.",2014-09-17
1,1986,3,This is the best hotel room I have ever stayed in.,2014-09-17
1,1986,4,However good things must come to an end so after 3 nights I was asked to downgrade to a Jr King Suite (still a grade higher than I booked).,2014-09-17
1,1986,5,"This suite was amply spacious, beautifully renovated.",2014-09-17

1,1986,9,It you only receive a normal room you are missing out on one of the best hotels in the world.,2014-09-17
1,1986,10,Downsides: the pool is a complete joke.,2014-09-17

1,1988,5,"Also, if you take the metro,not JR, you can just walk there less than 5 mins.",2014-09-16

1,1990,9,Took the airport limousine (a bus) arranged by the hotel to Narita,2014-09-16
1,1991,1,Its totally worth it!,2014-09-16
1,1991,2,I think 300+ for such hotel is an attractive price.,2014-09-16
1,1991,3,"They are 10mins walk away from station, have complimentary shuttle service to train station that runs at every 20mins intervals till almost 10pm, a 24 Hr gym, an indoor swimming pool till 10pm, Airport express bus to and from Narita or Hanade Airport.",2014-09-16

1,1992,1,We stayed here for 6 nights on a 2 week trip to Japan.,2014-09-14
1,1992,2,"The location is excellent, in the heart of Shinjuku (though we realized later that for non-Japanese its better to stay in/around Roopongi).",2014-09-14
1,1992,3,The hotel has underground walkway access to Metro which was a great benefit.,2014-09-14
1,1992,4,The breakfast buffet was sumptuous though it never got changed for all 6 days (so we decided to skip it on our last day).,2014-09-14
1,1992,5,The rooms were small though but real estate in Tokyo is precious.,2014-09-14
1,1992,6,"If you get access to executive lounge, which we were, the 37th floor lounge has great views, food almost all day ans cocktails in the evening.",2014-09-14
1,1992,7,"Overall, a good choice.",2014-09-14
1,1993,1,"I don't usually opt for such large properties but booked here as a nod to a stay as a teenager, where I experienced terrific service… obviously this was quite a few years ago.",2014-09-14
1,1993,2,"Stayed in an executive junior suite, apparently newly refurbished.",2014-09-14
1,1993,3,"Overall, it's hard to fault this hotel as far as big chains go - this is a place for airline crews (SQ, LH, etc stay here), large groups of tourists and as a good location for a low cost leisure stay in Tokyo – Shinjuku has many points of interest in itself.",2014-09-14
1,1993,4,Rates are very low and there seem to be a lot of promos.,2014-09-14
1,1993,5,"To be fair, my overall rating of the property reflects this reality and not the comments below (which would score one or two points less).",2014-09-14
1,1993,6,"Without status however, this is not a welcoming property - it seems Hilton has taken loyalty to its limits, as, if anything, it now acts as a barrier of entry to non-HHonors guests - pretty stupid if you ask me.",2014-09-14
1,1993,7,"First time in ages I had to pay for Wifi (JPY1700/day) and denied checking out one hour later than standard as next guest ""had status and was entitled to check-in at exactly 2pm"" (would she?).",2014-09-14
1,1993,8,"Considering some guests don't mind paying for larger suites or better rooms, there is absolutely no reason to stay here without status since you will be treated worse than anyone with a Gold card - which are ubiquitous it seems thanks to countless tie-ins with credit cards or other promos...",2014-09-14
1,1993,9,The room itself is wholly uninspiring and looks very dated already - seem to have been assembled through a knock-off catalogue of bad Italian design - the only Japanese detail (and original from way back) are the rice paper sliding shutters - bathroom is tiny and reminiscent of the one in the Novotel Wanchai I had to stay in during a typhoon in Hong Kong.,2014-09-14
1,1993,10,"Very cheap amenities too - made in China toiletries, cheap/thin paper products and incredibly poor towels...",2014-09-14
1,1993,11,considering this is likely to be your first tactile experience of the room it immediately creates a poor impression - you know there are cost-savings at every turn.,2014-09-14
1,1993,12,There are some bad design choices too - a single multi-plug electric outlet by the desk is located in a box and under the glass table - very hard to access especially if using a larger three-point plug...,2014-09-14
1,1993,13,"Breakfast which I was looking forward to, was awful, with overall, poor quality items.",2014-09-14
1,1993,14,I was also admonished for picking a quieter table in the zoo of breakfast with a comment that it had to be vacated before 11am (at 9am...,2014-09-14
1,1993,15,why would anyone spend 2 hours with such a disappointing spread is anyone's guess).,2014-09-14
1,1993,16,"So there you have it – decent and dare I say convenient for a low cost stay, this property has made it pointless to book there for non-status guests looking for a better room / experience...",2014-09-14
1,1993,17,why keep being reminded of what you’re not receiving when it’s clear that so many of these so-called benefits are standard elsewhere… makes no sense.,2014-09-14
1,1993,18,"I’ve long got bored with chasing miles and points, after a few fun years with Randy and the original flyertalk crew, and as a former HH Diamond/ SPG Platinum/etc it strikes me that confusing loyalty management for true hospitality is probably a pretty bad long term mistake.",2014-09-14
1,1994,1,Got in pretty late and found out they had a room available to upgrade.,2014-09-13
1,1994,2,"It included internet and access to the Executive Lounge, a difference of about $50 bucks but was it worth it.",2014-09-13
1,1994,3,"Huge room, very clean.",2014-09-13
1,1994,4,"The executive lounge had a huge breakfast in the morning both Western dishes and Japanese dishes, they even had mimosas.",2014-09-13
1,1994,5,Great way to start the day!,2014-09-13
1,1994,6,And great cocktail hour with appetizers which was a nice way to relax after long day of sight seeing.,2014-09-13
1,1994,7,"The subway station is right under the hotel so it made getting around very easy,",2014-09-13
1,1995,1,Perfect location walking distance to the subway (and shuttle bus to the airport).,2014-09-11
1,1995,2,Perfect breakfast and lunch buffet.,2014-09-11
1,1995,3,"Perfect rooms, clean and nicely decorated.",2014-09-11
1,1995,4,Perfect restaurant with delicious tempuras.,2014-09-11
1,1995,5,"Perfect personnel: courteous, competent, friendly.",2014-09-11
1,1995,6,A hotel to go back to.,2014-09-11
1,1996,1,I stayed at the Hilton for a week while on business.,2014-09-11
1,1996,2,It is a beautiful hotel located in the business district of Shinjuku ku.,2014-09-11
1,1996,3,"The rooms were very modern and updated; The bathroom was fantastic (soaking tub); And I will always be charmed by Japanese toilets....yes, odd to say.....but the Japanese have created such fantastic toilets with so many settings its like driving a small car.",2014-09-11
1,1996,4,The train station is a very short walk or quick shuttle from the train station.,2014-09-11
1,1996,5,"Beware, I found the trains to be very complicated and I have traveled the world.",2014-09-11
1,1996,6,There is great shopping and restaurants close by.,2014-09-11
1,1996,7,"Get out at night and see the amazing light show of billboards, large screen videos, etc., all located just a few blocks from the hotel.",2014-09-11
1,1996,8,I had club level access which offered attentive service and great food options.,2014-09-11
1,1996,9,It was a nice mixture of Eastern and Western cuisine.,2014-09-11
1,1996,10,The view was spectacular.,2014-09-11
1,1996,11,"If you have time, book a private your guide who can help navigate you to some of the most impressive areas of Tokyo.",2014-09-11
1,1996,12,My guide was an amazing 70+ year old Japanese gentleman who spoke good English and met me at the hotel.,2014-09-11
1,1996,13,Dont get me wrong......You would never have known his age and he consistently out-paced me everywhere we went.,2014-09-11
1,1996,14,He was such a lovely man.,2014-09-11
1,1996,15,Be open to true Japanese cuisine.,2014-09-11
1,1996,16,Make sure you try Shabu-Shabu - the concierge can direct you to a recommended spot.,2014-09-11
1,1996,17,"Also, venture into a local sushi bar to get true sushi.",2014-09-11
1,1996,18,"I dont know what I ate, which was probably a good thing, but it was all delicious.",2014-09-11
1,1996,19,"I left my heart in Tokyo and can only pray that I have the opportunity to return to this beautiful, friendly, safe city.",2014-09-11
1,1996,20,I would absolutely stay at the Hilton upon my return.,2014-09-11
1,1997,1,This hotel is located close to Shinjuku station and has a free shuttle bus to and from the station every 20 mins.,2014-09-09
1,1997,2,This was one of the deciding factors in choosing it and it proved to be very handy indeed.,2014-09-09
1,1997,3,The Hilton itself is a very nice hotel with attentive staff and good amenities.,2014-09-09
1,1997,4,"Breakfast was excellent, so was room service.",2014-09-09
1,1997,5,"The pool looked inviting, but heated to 30 degrees so not an option in hot weather.",2014-09-09
1,1997,6,Our room was quiet and comfortable.,2014-09-09
1,1997,7,We asked for a room on a higher floor to avoid any possible renovation noise that was mentioned in some previous reviews.,2014-09-09
1,1997,8,We had no disruptions and slept well.,2014-09-09
1,1997,9,There is a small supermarket and several restaurants underneath the hotel and a chemist shop near the business centre.,2014-09-09
1,1997,10,We found these extra services very handy when tired and hot at the end of a long day.,2014-09-09
1,1997,11,We found Hilton Tokyo to be an excellent choice for tourists and thoroughly recommend it.,2014-09-09
1,1998,1,Stayed there for three nights on our return leg from Sapporo.,2014-09-08
1,1998,2,"The hotel was a drop-off/pick-up point for the airport limousine bus service, which means you'll be dropped at the door step of the hotel.",2014-09-08
1,1998,3,Room was spacious (for Tokyo's standard) and well appointed.,2014-09-08
1,1998,4,We stayed on the 33rd floor which offered a great view.,2014-09-08
1,1998,5,"Breakfast had good variety, but the food type appears to be the same.",2014-09-08
1,1998,6,"But if you're sitting at one of the sofa seats, the table can be a little low.",2014-09-08
1,1998,7,"A major advantage of Hilton is there's a shuttle bus every 20min running between the hotel and Shinjuku station, stopping in front of Keio department store.",2014-09-08
1,1998,8,This really helped as the walk to Shinjuku station from the hotel in the summer heat can be a challenge.,2014-09-08
1,1998,9,Another advantage is the hotel is linked underground to one of the Tokyo Metro's station.,2014-09-08
1,1998,10,Overall a very good experience,2014-09-08
1,1999,1,We asked for a room high up when we reserved and were rewarded with a lovely view of the megalopolis from one of the top floors.,2014-09-07
1,1999,2,Never a wait for the elevators and they are fast.,2014-09-07
1,1999,3,Excellent concierge service.,2014-09-07
1,1999,4,We had all sorts of strange requests ranging from printing out the michelin bib gourmand restaurants in Shinjuku (website only in Japanese :) and where to get a professional tailor's scissor as a friend in Paris had heard that the Japanese make the best.,2014-09-07
1,1999,5,Neither was a problem for the concierge (unfortunately I do not remember his name) who gladly took the time to research and write everything down.,2014-09-07
1,1999,6,The only negative experience was at the bar at night.,2014-09-07
1,1999,7,"Having ordered drinks and sitting at our table, I noticed I had to plug in my smart phone and proceeded to use a plug at the end of the bar where no one was sitting.",2014-09-07
1,1999,8,"The manager in charge rushed up to me enquiring 'Can I help you' - seeing I was just plugging in my phone, I took that to mean I needed to ask for his personal permission before deigning to use 'his' plug' It was a rather bizarre situation and I did complain to the Assistant Manager the next day who apologized.",2014-09-07
1,1999,9,But we never went back there so Hilton lost a bit of business from us because of that (had I been Assistant Manager I would have offered 2 drinks on the house the next evening).,2014-09-07
1,1999,10,"Location-wise you are walking distance to the Shinjuku station with rail lines going everywhere you need, usually with no need to transfer.",2014-09-07
1,1999,11,The walk is a brisk 20 minutes from door to train.,2014-09-07
1,1999,12,There is a shuttle from the bus to the station but if you are a walker it is better not to wait.,2014-09-07
1,1999,13,"We figured out a short cut going diagonally across the street to the lobby of the highrise (the one with the Willer Express buses in front of it), then down the escalator and left, out the door and straight to the station.",2014-09-07
1,1999,14,Also nice for a blast of AC when walking in the summer heat and humidity.,2014-09-07
1,1999,15,Overall a very good experience.,2014-09-07
1,2000,1,My family & I stayed at Tokyo Hilton Shinjuku at the end of April 2014.,2014-09-06

1,2000,3,The views from the 37th floor were spectacular.,2014-09-06

1,2001,2,"For example, we were going to a wedding and I was not aware of the customs of a Japanese wedding.",2014-09-04
1,2001,3,They not only personally walked me to a store to buy the card for the wedding but they also explained how the card should be written and even loaned me the proper pen!!,2014-09-04
1,2001,4,Then they exchanged my yen for new crisp yen for the card--I would not have even known that I should do that for the wedding!!,2014-09-04
1,2001,5,"The room was larger than I expected, the bathroom especially was great, the breakfast buffet and lounge were wonderful, the pool and spa were terrific, too.",2014-09-04

1,2033,2,"At check-in, we were offered early-check in at 11am and our 3 rooms on Level 34 provided us amazing view of Shinjuku and Tokyo as a whole.",2014-08-16
1,2033,3,We also got discounted price for breakfast buffets because of our long stay at the hotel by the friendly receptionist.,2014-08-16
1,2033,4,"Location-wise, it's located at the safer and quieter side of Shinjuku but the hotel provides a free shuttle bus to Shinjuku Station which stop in front of Keio Department Store (bus stop number 21) and this is really convenient for guests.",2014-08-16
1,2033,5,"If you prefer, you can also walk from the hotel to the hipper and louder side of Shinjuku which is only like 10 mins walk away.",2014-08-16

1,2033,13,"Good point: when they clean your rooms, they really clean them throughout.",2014-08-16
1,2033,14,I thought their works were good :),2014-08-16
1,2033,15,2) We were told that it was the school holidays when we went hence MAYBE that's why the hotel was so packed throughout our stay.,2014-08-16
1,2033,16,"At breakfast, there were long queues before we got seated so there was always that battle of patience every morning.",2014-08-16
1,2033,17,Bonus point: wholesome Asian breakfast!!,2014-08-16

1,2034,4,The omelet chefs were fantastic.,2014-08-16

1,2034,6,Everything else was pretty mediocre.,2014-08-16
1,2034,7,The sausage was hot dogs and the bacon was crap.,2014-08-16
1,2034,8,The executive lounge suffers from the same malaise as the breakfast buffet - same mediocre stuff all the time.,2014-08-16
1,2034,9,"It is depressing to go in every night and see chicken nuggets with ketchup (sometimes called ""BBQ sauce"").",2014-08-16
1,2034,10,"It's fine if you want to serve the same chicken nuggets, fried veg, samosas every night, but just offer some Thai chili sauce to go with it and people will be happy.",2014-08-16
1,2034,11,"Better yet, take a page from the recipe book of the Hilton on the Park Melbourne (or any of the Hiltons in Victoria, New South Wales, or South Australia), which has consistently excellent offerings in the executive lounge.",2014-08-16
1,2034,12,"The room was fairly small, but we were traveling with a pet, and I believe they have certain rooms set aside for people with pets, so I wasn't expecting an upgrade.",2014-08-16

1,2035,2,"The location is great, in the middle of Shinjuku, close to Tochomae station (do NOT think to walk with your bags from Shinjuku station, it doesn't make sense!) and the property is in very good condition.",2014-08-16

1,2035,4,"The bathroom was not too large either, but everything worked nicely.",2014-08-16
1,2035,5,"The bar in the lobby is a real life-saver at night, and the concierge has been quite helpful in providing a power adapter (do NOT think of traveling through Japan with a professional adapter with the central safety plug, almost no plug in Japan has the right socket for that!).",2014-08-16
1,2035,6,"The one thing that was a bit annoying was the WiFi: the sign-in only worked with Internet Explorer and as a matter of fact I find unacceptable that hotel WiFi is charged, it is such a commodity that it should be included in the room rate.",2014-08-16
1,2035,7,"Moreover, the staff at the reception didn't immediately figure out I was a Gold member and did not immediately offer a room upgrade.",2014-08-16

1,2036,5,Negotiating the tube and trains took us a bit longer to master.,2014-08-14

1,2056,4,We had breakfast included and it was a ,2014-07-30
1,2056,5,magnificent buffet.,2014-07-30
1,2056,6,The hotels main restaurants were going through renovation so if you wanted a little fine dining you had to go elsewhere but the buffet restaurant was more than adequate if you wanted to stay in.,2014-07-30
1,2056,7,Room service was good and the food excellent.,2014-07-30
1,2056,8,The hotel is situated a 10 minute taxi ride to shinjuku MRT but the hotel offers a free shuttle to the station every 20 minutes.,2014-07-30

1,2058,3,We were on the 25th floor and the view was stupendous - normally we are not the slightest bit concerned about having a 'room with a view' but in this case I take it all back.,2014-07-28
1,2058,4,We were so impressed that we decided to take our first meal in Tokyo in our room.,2014-07-28
1,2058,5,This was actually very reasonably priced and I'm sure if we had eaten in a restaurant with the same vista we would have paid through the nose.,2014-07-28
1,2058,6,"The room facilities were exceptional, fluffy dressing gowns or traditional Japanese ones, and all the potions etc you could wish for.",2014-07-28

1,2060,1,"This is one of the best Hilton's we've ever stayed in, wonderful bustling foyer area (sometimes a little too busy but that's Tokyo for you!) and the rooms were a good size for Japan, nicely finished.",2014-07-25
1,2060,2,The location is perfect with a very handy shuttle to Shinjuku station that we used every day.,2014-07-25
1,2060,3,Frankly this hotel would get 5 stars if it wasn't for my pet hate which is when a place holds it's guests to ransom for their on site amenities.,2014-07-25
1,2060,4,"The prices in the foyer restaurant are just ridiculous, one late night we didn'd have the time or energy left to go out so ate in there and I paid 1800 Yen for fish & chips with the smallest portion of fish I'd ever seen - we were also hustled out of the restaurant after our meal as apparently the staff were keen to close (it was only about 9.30pm).",2014-07-25
1,2060,5,The bar in the hotel is lovely but again prices just too much to justify more than one drink there - they charge the same as the New York bar in the Park Hyatt except you don't get amazing table service and fantastic views of Tokyo!,2014-07-25
1,2060,6,I'm sure the hordes of business people through the hotel every week don't care but it's a bit much for you're average couple of family travelling.,2014-07-25
1,2060,7,"Thoroughly recommend this hotel though, for Tokyo the nightly rate we paid wasn't actually too bad and you can fairly easily go out in Shinjuku for more modestly price food and drink.",2014-07-25
1,2061,1,You can expect great service typical of Hilton hotels.,2014-07-25
1,2061,2,The staffs are nice and attentive to your needs.,2014-07-25

1,2063,3,"Colorful room, with Japanese window and a very large rooms for a Japanese standard.",2014-07-23
1,2063,4,The only draw back was the concierge staff were a bit rude and so were some(not all) of the front office staff.,2014-07-23
1,2063,5,"Apart from the rooms, the other best thing is you have free shuttle to the central part of the town, Shinjuku, where you can go to shopping...food..or even the main Shinjuku subway station.",2014-07-23

1,2065,1,"Simple, relatively compact and clean room.",2014-07-21
1,2065,2,I was in a room with two singles on 24th floor facing the backside of the hotel which actually had a little bit of a view in the distance as the front side of the hotel has several office towers blocking much of the city view.,2014-07-21

1,2065,16,"- No steam sauna, only dry sauna (the Conrad Tokyo has a stomping good steamroom)",2014-07-21
1,2065,17,- Great location in Tokyo - about 20 minute walk from what i would consider a very happening area in Tokyo yet a quick walk back to the quiet business district where the hotel is located - the immediate blocks around the hotel are primarily office towers.,2014-07-21

1,2066,4,"Still, the rooms are quiet, clean, sleek and modern; you'll breathe a huge sigh of relief when you close the door on a hectic day in Shinjuku.",2014-07-18
1,2066,5,"That walk to the station may cause you to break a sweat, and yet it may not be worth it to pay for a taxi that sits in traffic.",2014-07-18

1,2068,9,Luckily there are several decent restaurants in the area that we enjoyed for less than half the price that we paid at the hotel.,2014-07-16
1,2068,10,Paying $10 for a bottle of 250ml Coke when you order room service is very expensive when you can get the same drink for $1.50 from the convenience store in the Hiltopia shopping centre next to the hotel.,2014-07-16

2,3348,10,cold and impersonal.,2017-04-23

2,3360,3,Here is my Top 5 List of why I will stay at the Westin Tokyo again.,2017-04-14
2,3360,4,1. Hotel/Rooms- The hotel does not look like a traditional Japanese hotel which is usually more minimalistic.,2017-04-14
2,3360,5,The Westin Tokyo looks like a luxurious European hotel with a beautiful grand staircase and lots of rich wood and beautiful floor tile.,2017-04-14
2,3360,6,The rooms are very large by Tokyo standards and luxuriously appointed like the hotel.,2017-04-14
2,3360,7,2. Service- I’ve always had great service at this hotel.,2017-04-14
2,3360,8,I wanted a view of the Tokyo Tower on the Club Floor and it wasn’t available when I checked in.,2017-04-14
2,3360,9,"The front office manager, Takeshi, was able to get one of the best rooms on the Club floor the next day.",2017-04-14
2,3360,10,It was a little bit of a pain packing and moving but it was worth it.,2017-04-14
2,3360,11,The concierge service is also very good.,2017-04-14
2,3360,12,I’ve stayed at other Tokyo Japanese owned hotels where the concierges don’t speak much English.,2017-04-14
2,3360,13,This is a big plus at the Westin Tokyo.,2017-04-14
2,3360,14,"3. Breakfast at the Terrace and Club Floor Lounge- As a Platinum Starwood member, I was able to have breakfast at the Terrace restaurant buffet.",2017-04-14
2,3360,15,"This is a very extensive buffet with an omelet bar, freshly squeezed juices, smoked salmon, daily fish, dim sum, noodle bar, salad bar, fresh fruits, miso soup, pancakes, waffles, and a ton of desserts.",2017-04-14
2,3360,16,The Club floor also has breakfast but the Terrace is far better.,2017-04-14
2,3360,17,"The Club Floor Lounge also has Happy Hour every night from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm which includes Yebisu beer, wines, and other alcohol.",2017-04-14

2,3360,19,Also the lounge has an outstanding view of the city including the Tokyo Tower .,2017-04-14
2,3360,20,4 Location- Ebisu is a quieter and more residential area of Tokyo but there is lots of action near the Ebisu train station.,2017-04-14
2,3360,21,Some of my favorite restaurants are close to the Ebisu train station and don’t forget to try the Yokocho (across the street from the McDonalds) which is an indoor alley with over 20 Japanese restaurants.,2017-04-14
2,3360,22,I do admit that the 10 to 15 minute walk to the train station even with the moving walkway does get tiresome every day but every hotel has a tradeoff.,2017-04-14
2,3360,23,5. Price- The Westin Tokyo is priced very competitively and is usually way cheaper than other 5- Star Tokyo hotels.,2017-04-14
2,3361,1,Rarely are my views so far off the popular wisdom.,2017-04-13
2,3361,2,"As an SPG gold member, I know what service should look like.",2017-04-13

2,3361,4,Know this:,2017-04-13

2,3452,3,The suggested solution ....we could push them together.,2016-10-10
2,3452,4,Not the right answer folks.,2016-10-10
2,3452,5,"Staff were great although maybe the concierge could be a little more knowledgeable about ""things to see and do"" and helpful with regards booking things rather than simply handing out brochures and leaving the guest to figure it out.",2016-10-10
2,3452,6,The hotel does not have a pool (which I found strange) but they do have an arrangement with a nearby facility if a guest wants to swim.,2016-10-10
2,3452,7,"The issue is there is a 2,500 yen per day for the privilege which is expensive if you want to go do your laps.",2016-10-10

2,3452,9,Note to management.,2016-10-10
2,3452,10,The cost is not published so if you really feel you need to charge your guests for a facility that the vast majority of hotels in your category have onsite for free it is only fair to inform them before they ask where to pool is ie on your web site.,2016-10-10
2,3452,11,"Since we had a late flight out of Tokyo we checked out at normal time, left our bags in the care of the hotel (thank you) with a view to collecting them later.",2016-10-10
2,3452,12,We asked if there was a shower we could use to freshen up before we went to the airport and there was another charge.,2016-10-10
2,3452,13,Got your money so off you go was the feeling we were left with.,2016-10-10
2,3452,14,We actually paid one third of The Westin's proposed charge to utilise a great facility at Haneda airport.,2016-10-10
2,3452,15,All in all the general staff were excellent but they were let down by some poor management decisions,2016-10-10

2,3453,2,I can't say enough for the place.,2016-10-10

2,3501,4,"There are nice restaurants about but we only managed to eat downstairs at the Spanish themed buffet, which was ok with desserts variety probably outweighing the western Spanish foods(they did have jamon but better off without) Price was relatively normal($80-90pp) considering where it is.",2016-06-22
2,3501,5,We also had lunch at teppanyaki restaurant upstairs which we enjoyed a great deal as well.,2016-06-22

2,3511,4,Great for business but tough for family trip on a budget.,2016-06-10

2,3511,7,I couldnt get a good sleep and have to stack 3 pillows together.,2016-06-10

2,3512,9,the room is great; beds are comfortable.,2016-06-08
2,3512,10,I would say the only issue would be the location; it's about 10-15 walk to the nearest station.,2016-06-08
2,3512,11,"comfortable walk by the underpass links with shops, etc.",2016-06-08
2,3512,12,"but we came home late one night and the shopping center had closed so we couldn't use our normal route, and the walk home was a bit tricky and long.",2016-06-08
2,3512,13,taxi from ebisu station is about 800 yen.,2016-06-08
2,3512,14,I guess that most people who can afford to stay at Westin would probably just take a cab; so maybe this location issue is just for us.,2016-06-08
2,3512,15,one of the best stays in Tokyo otherwise!,2016-06-08
2,3513,1,The WESTIN is an upscale hotel in a residential neighborhood.,2016-06-08

2,3517,2,Located in Ebisu Shopping Center.,2016-06-04

2,3520,2,"While I absolutely loved the hotel - the room, service, and amenities were great - the location was unfortunately a major drawback for us.",2016-05-25
2,3520,3,"This is a great hotel if you are on a business trip, but if you are vacationing and want to explore Tokyo (which was our goal), this is probably not your best bet.",2016-05-25
2,3520,4,The hotel is in Ebisu/Meguro and is probably a 10 min walk from the Ebisu train station.,2016-05-25
2,3520,5,"While this doesn't sound far, walking it several times a day gets old and fast.",2016-05-25
2,3520,6,There's not much going on near the hotel or in Ebisu so you'll be using the train a lot!,2016-05-25
2,3520,7,The one plus is the Ebisu station is one train stop away from Shibuya which is a main center in Tokyo.,2016-05-25
2,3520,8,"Lastly, the hotel has a very ""business-y"" feel so unless you're planning to wear a suit everyday (I'm on vacation so no thanks!) you can expect to feel a bit out of place.",2016-05-25
2,3521,1,The hotel is your typical Westin in terms of decor.,2016-05-18
2,3521,2,"Think lots of marble, and columns.",2016-05-18
2,3521,3,"It's not necceserily my style, but we weren't there to decorate.",2016-05-18
2,3521,4,It's all well kept and clean with all the modern amenities you would expect from 5* hotel.,2016-05-18
2,3521,5,"We had an access to club room, which offered decent breakfast and dinner and free snack through the day.",2016-05-18
2,3521,6,"Staff was great, everyone we encountered was extremely nice and helpful.",2016-05-18
2,3521,7,Concierge spent half an hour on the phone to help us sort out some plane ticket issues.,2016-05-18
2,3521,8,Gym is quite inadequate.,2016-05-18
2,3521,9,Especially for the size of the hotel.,2016-05-18
2,3521,10,But they do offer access to a very modern facility right across the street that you can access via underpass that connects directly to the hotel.,2016-05-18
2,3521,11,What made it a great stay is the location.,2016-05-18
2,3521,12,It's near a park and more importantly located in nice 'young' residential neighborhood.,2016-05-18
2,3521,13,"There's countless small local restaurants, boutiques and quirky stores all around.",2016-05-18
2,3521,14,"It's not a tourist area, so communication could be a problem if you don't speak Japanese (we don't), but where there's a will there's a way and we got to enjoy some great food.",2016-05-18
2,3521,15,"It's also two stops, or about 30 min easy walk from Shibuya, which is worth checking out.",2016-05-18
2,3521,16,Short cab ride to Shinagawa station where you can catch a Narrita Express direct train to and from airport.,2016-05-18
2,3521,17,Overall great stay and we can recommend staying here.,2016-05-18
2,3522,1,"First, the GOOD - the location of Westin is ideal for family.",2016-05-16
2,3522,2,"I was torn between this location and Shinjuku (Hilton/Park Hyatt) and while I wanted to stay at the Park Hyatt, I'm so very glad my wife convinced me to stay at the Westin.",2016-05-16
2,3522,3,"If you haven't been to Tokyo, and you are traveling with little kids, there is no better option.",2016-05-16
2,3522,4,The hotel is connect to the Mitsukoshi department store as well as the Yebisu Garden Tower which has several good underground restaurants as well as the high end restaurants on the 37th floor.,2016-05-16
2,3522,5,There is also a Burger King so it's good for kids.,2016-05-16
2,3522,6,"There's a beer garden for the adults, just FYI.",2016-05-16
2,3522,7,The nearest subway station is the Ebisu station and it is about a 10 minute walk from the Westin but it has people mover so the walk isn't too bad.,2016-05-16
2,3522,8,"More importantly, because you can go from the Westin to the station through the underground connection (directly from the elevator of Westin to inside the actual station) this is great for hot/raining/snowy/etc...",2016-05-16
2,3522,9,whatever weather condition.,2016-05-16
2,3522,10,the hotel is a little bit dated.,2016-05-16
2,3522,11,The hotel also provides all the amenities that you can ask for but you can tell it's still holding onto its glory days of the 80's.,2016-05-16
2,3522,12,"That said, everything is clean and the rooms are kept extremely clean.",2016-05-16
2,3522,13,The service is as expected of a Westin.,2016-05-16
2,3522,14,They are professional and they provide you with everything you need.,2016-05-16
2,3522,15,"The best impression we received was from the bellhop and the concierge who went out of their way to provide our children with mini erasers (Japanese/Korean love erasers, pencils, stationary, etc) that the kids were thrilled.",2016-05-16
2,3522,16,"They also provide a coloring book with color pencils, which was awesome for the kids.",2016-05-16
2,3522,17,"As for the rest, there is nothing spectacular but also there is nothing else you'd need.",2016-05-16
2,3522,18,The breakfast option in the lobby level is great if you are traveling with kids.,2016-05-16
2,3522,19,"It has all the usual continental options as well as the hot (omelet, scrambled, bacon, etc...) as well as a good Japanese option.",2016-05-16
2,3522,20,My kids loved the rice and miso soup for breakfast.,2016-05-16
2,3522,21,"The BAD - As SPG Gold, we get breakfast for two but they do charge about $20 USD for children 5 or older.",2016-05-16
2,3522,22,That in my opinion was not worth it.,2016-05-16
2,3522,23,"But considering we were visiting with our friends, we paid it and enjoyed the breakfast.",2016-05-16
2,3522,24,"As an alternative, you can use their executive lounge for breakfast (executive level rooms or SPG member upgrade) and they will not charge you anything for you and your family.",2016-05-16
2,3522,25,"The other ""bad"" of the property was that the staff wasn't the usual level of enthusiasm or energy.",2016-05-16
2,3522,26,"They were cordial but not the ""i'll take care of everything"" mentality of other higher end hotels.",2016-05-16
2,3522,27,The rooms also had a lot to be desired.,2016-05-16
2,3522,28,"While we were upgraded to a corner king, the normal standard room is quite small for a family of four.",2016-05-16
2,3522,29,"There are suites available at the hotel but based on the prices, i don't think they would be worth it.",2016-05-16
2,3522,30,I would stick with getting a king and trying for an upgrade to the corner king.,2016-05-16
2,3522,31,"The Ugly - well, there really wasn't anything there that constituted an ""ugly"" thing.",2016-05-16
2,3522,32,"I personally believe the decor was pretty bad and bordering ""ugly"" it does not rise to the level necessitating that connotation in this review.",2016-05-16
2,3522,33,"So, in short it's a great hotel for family stays but I wouldn't expect the level of detail oriented service you see at the Park Hyatt/Mandarin/Ritz/Conrad.",2016-05-16
2,3522,34,"But without such expectations, due to its location and convenience and the leisurely area surrounding the hotel, it is far better than trying your luck with Shinjuku area and having to deal with the mass of humanity that filter through that station as well as the nearby Shibuya station.",2016-05-16
2,3522,35,I would stay clear of those two stations if you are with kids.,2016-05-16
2,3523,1,Rooms have great view.,2016-05-15
2,3523,2,Hotel is five minutes walk from metro.,2016-05-15

2,3523,4,Excellent restaurants and bars.,2016-05-15

2,3523,9,The shuttle bus to airport costs 3500 yen per head and is slightly costly.,2016-05-15

2,3526,6,Try the spa it's the ultimate treat after a long howl flight and you can have it in your room,2016-05-13
2,3527,1,The hotel is far from all the historical sites and attractions but this is compensated by two facts.,2016-05-12
2,3527,2,First there are a suburban train station and an underground station which can be reached in respectively five and ten minutes on a footway that is partly covered and some sections of it have a moving pavement.,2016-05-12
2,3527,3,Second the hotel is located next to the Yebisu Garden Place where there are numerous shops and restaurants.,2016-05-12
2,3527,4,"The rooms are very spacious (which is rare in Japan, hence their high prices) and have all the possible amenities.",2016-05-12

2,3527,9,However those who would just like to eat sushi could also go to the restaurants of Yebisu Garden Place where they can get them at a very advantageous price.,2016-05-12
2,3527,10,The service is excellent and the personnel is very friendly with a rather good knowledge of the English language.,2016-05-12

2,3531,2,It offered solid Customer service and a very nice executive lounge with a nice buffet breakfast.,2016-05-05
2,3531,3,The rooms however were subpar and disappointing.,2016-05-05

2,3534,1,We stayed 2 nights here.,2016-04-28
2,3534,2,"Location-wise, the nearest train station is ""Ebisu"" and from there, expect to walk about 12 mins to the Westin (long moving walkways inside the station, followed by a long underpass to the hotel).",2016-04-28
2,3534,3,"In terms of amenities, there are lots of food and shopping options both within and around Ebisu station and the Westin so that's good.",2016-04-28
2,3534,4,"If you'd rather stay and eat at the Westin though, they have a good range of dining options, and I recommend the buffet breakfast at the hotel which offers an excellent variety of good quality food.",2016-04-28

2,3535,6,It is expensive in an expensive city.,2016-04-27

2,3535,8,Even on the company card I slept better just going across the road to Starbucks.,2016-04-27
2,3535,9,It's not city center but close to a metro and a main line station so getting around is easy from there..,2016-04-27

2,3537,1,This property is in a perfect location.,2016-04-26
2,3537,2,Close to the Tokyo subway (and a shopping centre next door for those in need of retail therapy !).,2016-04-26
2,3537,3,Rooms are of good size and in excellent condition.,2016-04-26
2,3537,4,But what makes this property is the staff.,2016-04-26

2,3538,3,"Location is great, walking distance from Meguro station that can take you to the loop in downtown.",2016-04-25
2,3538,4,"Also, there are taxis always available - longest wait was probably 3 mins - so you don't have to worry about getting Uber (which doesn't work that great in Japan anyway).",2016-04-25
2,3538,5,And if you get a room in a high floor with a city view you have a great view of Tokyo tower.,2016-04-25
2,3538,6,"You have a small gym to workout well equipped and not too crowded but if you're a runner definitely go for a run outside, they have maps with a 3mi loop which is great, and of course you can borrow the gear with the pack light program.",2016-04-25
2,3538,7,"My only comment is that this hotel doesn't look like a Westin but rather like a Ritz-Carlton, like a bit overloaded in decorations and not the sleek clean look of many Westins.",2016-04-25

2,3539,5,4. Next to a shopping area with great restaurants etc,2016-04-24

2,3540,4,"It was getting late, all the duty free stores were closed.",2016-04-23
2,3540,5,He had to make several calls on our behalf.,2016-04-23
2,3540,6,"Finally, he confirmed for us our best chance for making the purchase was still the original duty free store tomorrow morning before we board our flight.",2016-04-23
2,3540,7,"His professionalism is exemplary to other concierges, Still thinking about his clients even when he was off the clock.",2016-04-23

2,3541,9,"I want to spend more time talking about the neighborhood, Ebisu.",2016-04-22
2,3541,10,Don't be fooled by the Meguro address.,2016-04-22
2,3541,11,You will really want to spend your time in Ebisu.,2016-04-22
2,3541,12,It's a great feel.,2016-04-22
2,3541,13,Not too bustling but plenty of hip looking professionals (not the banker types you would see in Ginza) walking around during daytime work hours and fun bars at night.,2016-04-22
2,3541,14,Lots of good food and so reasonably priced for such high quality.,2016-04-22

2,3541,20,Genius.,2016-04-22

2,3541,22,"We used the JR Yamanote line to experience other neighborhoods, and while we had fun taking in the bustle of for example Shinjuku station, Tokyo station, and the Shibuya crossing, we were so glad to come 'home' to our neighborhood each night where we could catch our breath.",2016-04-22

2,3542,32,A nice plus is also the soups during the afternoons.,2016-04-22

2,3543,4,The staff are welcoming and always have a smile.,2016-04-21
2,3543,5,"Not only at the front desk, but all staff including cleaners and kitchen staff...quite refreshing for a big international hotel.",2016-04-21
2,3543,6,"I chose the hotel, because of the Metro and JR Line stations nearby.",2016-04-21
2,3543,7,Ebisu station is about 5 minutes walk away and can be reached under cover (handy for rainy Tokyo days).,2016-04-21
2,3543,8,From here you can use the Metro or JR Line.,2016-04-21
2,3543,9,"I also used Meguro station, which is an easy 10 minute walk from the hotel, which gives you more access to the brilliant Tokyo rail network.",2016-04-21
2,3543,10,What was a nice surprise is the area that the hotel is located in.,2016-04-21
2,3543,11,It is opposite the 'Ebisu Garden Place' which is a mall and restaurant area containing lots of Japanese and Western restaurants.,2016-04-21

2,3544,3,I found my room to plain.,2016-04-21
2,3544,4,The shower was okay but small.,2016-04-21
2,3544,5,The breakfast is unimpressive for Asian standards (which are the best breakfast buffets in the world!).,2016-04-21
2,3544,6,The real kicker was that I went to the gym around 5:30am (couldn't sleep) and the three treadmills and two ellipticals were already occupied.,2016-04-21
2,3544,7,I remembered from a prior visit that they had provided a pass to the local health club so I could use the pool.,2016-04-21
2,3544,8,I went downstairs and asked the front desk for a pass - they tried to charge me the equivalent of $27 USD for a day pass to this gym (the last time the pass was free but this was over two years ago).,2016-04-21
2,3544,9,I am not so upset about them trying to charge me for the day pass as I am for the fact that their gym is so small within such a large hotel.,2016-04-21
2,3545,1,This is certainly a very good hotel .,2016-04-20
2,3545,2,"Nice location in Ebisu with lot of restaurants , mall , Ebisu beer museum & Ebisu tower around .",2016-04-20

2,3545,7,the express counter service staff was really good & helpful too.,2016-04-20

2,3545,9,he did give excellent service whenever i asked for anything .,2016-04-20
2,3545,10,"he was good in remembering guest names too , would always address me with my last name .",2016-04-20

2,3546,2,"Reception at check in was very cold and not welcoming at all, likewise when I tried to use concierge the lady seemed put out that she needed to help me.",2016-04-19
2,3546,3,The one positive is the staff in club lounge continue to be great although if you want a seat during cocktail hour make sure you are there before start time at 5.30pm otherwise you'll be standing and feeling very awkward.,2016-04-19
2,3546,4,"Made my reservation on the basis of club room access to a very good out sourced gym (the one in hotel is tiny), which was confirmed at time of booking.",2016-04-19
2,3546,5,"When arrived at hotel was told this relationship had ceased and if I wanted to use the gym it would cost me 3,500 yen each visit.",2016-04-19
2,3546,6,No apology offered or given the circumstance exception was made....,2016-04-19
2,3546,7,again thought very bad service.,2016-04-19
2,3546,8,Breakfast was noticeably poorer from previous visit.,2016-04-19
2,3546,9,I have just completed stays at Westins in Cape Town and Bangkok and with these hotels charging half the room rate of Westin Tokyo they provide a breakfast that puts Tokyo to shame.,2016-04-19
2,3546,10,In the end we stopped going to breakfast because it was so average.,2016-04-19
2,3546,11,I don't think we will be coming back to this hotel as for the rate they charge can easily find somewhere elsewhere who will value our business more.,2016-04-19

2,3563,9,"The Spa had a steam room, whirlpool, showers and lots of nice facial products for use.",2016-03-19
2,3563,10,"My only complaint about the Spa is that to use the facilities without a service costs 2000 yen…I’ve visited many other Westins where the use of the steam room and sauna are generally free, so this is a shame.",2016-03-19
2,3563,11,My only other real complaint about this hotel is The Terrace restaurant.,2016-03-19
2,3563,12,The lunch and dinner buffet is “USA buffet” theme and it’s just terrible.,2016-03-19

2,3654,1,"Excellent property, upscale, and certainly in a quieter area.",2015-10-06
2,3654,2,The 10 minute walk to the train station is an excellent trade off to stay in this lovely location.,2015-10-06
2,3654,3,I had a 48 hour stay and managed to get around quite a bit by rail.,2015-10-06
2,3654,4,Breakfast was wonderful both days with no problem getting a coffee.,2015-10-06
2,3654,5,Dinner at Yebisu was worth every yen.,2015-10-06

2,3655,8,The rooms are big for Tokyo standards.,2015-10-05
2,3655,9,"The hotel decoration is very classic,...",2015-10-05
2,3655,10,maybe a bit too classic for what I am used to from Westin.,2015-10-05
2,3655,11,However this was no issue for us at all.,2015-10-05
2,3655,12,I just felt that at the breakfast buffet downstairs some optimizations can be made.,2015-10-05
2,3655,13,I found the buffet choise not massive for such a big hotel...,2015-10-05
2,3655,14,but the biggest issue was the staff.,2015-10-05
2,3655,15,I had the feeling there was often too little staff and it took a long time till coffee came and dirty plates were replaced.,2015-10-05
2,3655,16,However - do not let that small thing scare you off.,2015-10-05
2,3655,17,I would recomment this hotel for a holiday or business trip in Tokyo!,2015-10-05
2,3656,1,I really did not like the decor of this hotel.,2015-10-04
2,3656,2,It felt like being in San Diego in 1990.,2015-10-04
2,3656,3,"The faux European nonsense was all over the place: columns in our room, plastic painted like marble in the bathroom, gilt touches all over the lobby.",2015-10-04
2,3656,4,"The problem is, this hotel is part of the Ebisu Garden Place, which is all decorated in dated earth-toned stone.",2015-10-04
2,3656,5,"If you are going to Tokyo, why not get Tokyo?",2015-10-04
2,3656,6,"Beyond that breakfast was pretty decent, service was fine.",2015-10-04
2,3656,7,"Pool was a bit far and not a pool for relaxing, just for exercise.",2015-10-04
2,3656,8,"Even as a Starwood Platinum, I won't be back.",2015-10-04
2,3656,9,"I'll go back to the Sheraton, or I'll just stay at one of the Hyatts.",2015-10-04
2,3657,1,The location is outside the busiest areas of Tokyo but absolutely convenient because getting to Japan Rail and the Ebisu subway station is quick and easy because of moving walkways from the stations to the hotel through a fabulous YEbisu Garden Mall.,2015-10-02
2,3657,2,"We were tired when we arrived, and the check in staff noticed it so brought us water as we approached the desk.",2015-10-02

2,3658,5,My two recommendations are either the little Italian place for excellent pasta or the french bakery St Germain for croissants and treats that are better than anything I've ever tasted in Paris.,2015-09-29
2,3658,6,"As for the hotel, the decor is extravagant-elegance.",2015-09-29

2,3660,1,"We all expect Westin Hotels to be the same: reliable, comfortable, competent.",2015-09-24
2,3660,2,"But most of all, we expect them to deliver what they promise.",2015-09-24
2,3660,3,"Right now, this hotel's website (and guest directory) say: ""Interested guests can take advantage of the swimming pool in the adjacent Club at Yebisu Garden for a fee; Starwood Preferred Gold and Platinum guests swim for free.""",2015-09-24
2,3660,4,It's not true.,2015-09-24
2,3660,5,"If you are under 20 (twenty), you cannot swim in that pool.",2015-09-24
2,3660,6,Point blank refusal.,2015-09-24
2,3660,7,Many insincere and meaningless apologies from management; a suggestion of taking a taxi to the Sheraton (where I could pay!,2015-09-24
2,3660,8,for my kids to swim); no change to the website.,2015-09-24
2,3660,9,Vote with your feet.,2015-09-24
2,3661,1,My husband and I traveled to Japan last Christmas...,2015-09-23
2,3661,2,We had never been there before and were incredibly excited to explore a new beautiful country.,2015-09-23

2,3661,4,We stayed at the Westin for the first two nights of our stay...,2015-09-23

2,3661,8,Don't miss their daily brunch- it's fantastic and has so many options of food!,2015-09-23
2,3661,9,"We want to go back and explore more of Tokyo and when we do, we will definitely stay here!",2015-09-23
2,3662,1,"Possibly this is a good hotel for business travellers and given the easy proximity to the train station, fine if you are just looking for a big 'safe' chain hotel to return to at night.",2015-09-21
2,3662,2,"But if you're looking to also get a feel for Tokyo, I'd recommend looking elsewhere as there appears very little 'neighbourhood' around it: in fact directly opposite is a faux French chateau specialising in weddings and an Italian restaurant - and just beyond that a very bland mall.",2015-09-21
2,3662,3,Certainly we had a better experience as travellers in terms of proximity to local restaurants and street activity at another time staying in the Shiba Park district.,2015-09-21
2,3662,4,"From a service perspective, our experience at the Westin was not great (I won't re-live it here)and although ultimately our concerns were resolved, it is apparent that chaos ensues when large groups (such as multiple wedding parties) arrive.",2015-09-21
2,3662,5,"Although clean and functional, the décor does need modernising and rather surprisingly the lifts do not have a security swipe system to ensure appropriate floor access.",2015-09-21
2,3662,6,"I wouldn't say 'don't do it' - after all, it is perfectly functional - but I really think you can do better.",2015-09-21
2,3663,1,"First, I will say that this is a lovely hotel with a very friendly staff.",2015-09-21
2,3663,2,"We have been in our SPG floor room for a few days, and it has been a nearly perfect stay.",2015-09-21
2,3663,3,"I live the bed (very firm), the bathroom is efficient & pretty, and the view is spectacular.",2015-09-21
2,3663,4,There is an underground walkway that leads to the Ebisu Station (puts you minutes from any place you'll need to get to!).,2015-09-21
2,3663,5,The only criticism I have is about a promotion through SPG.,2015-09-21
2,3663,6,"If you dine in the hotel, and you use your SPG Amex card, you're supposed to get 15% off your food tab.",2015-09-21
2,3663,7,"I've been dining and not seeing the discount, so I asked at the SPG desk.",2015-09-21
2,3663,8,"They were gracious, however, now I've had to take a few calls and messages.",2015-09-21
2,3663,9,"I've been sent back to the restaurants with my card to beg for the discount, but the manager wasn't there.",2015-09-21
2,3663,10,"So, now I am told to wait for yet another phone call that will allow me to run back down to the restaurant to again beg for my discount.",2015-09-21
2,3663,11,Really?,2015-09-21
2,3663,12,"This is not professional, and I expect better from SPG as well as Westin.",2015-09-21
2,3663,13,"Ideally, this would have been corrected internally...as it is a Westin promotion, not to mention that I am supposed to be enjoying my vacation, not running around correcting the hotel's mistake.",2015-09-21
2,3664,1,"I was here a few weeks ago with work, and I'm actually coming back in the next couple of days.",2015-09-18
2,3664,2,"This is a large hotel by Japanese standards, with a massively imposing foyer area, with sweeping marble staircase.",2015-09-18
2,3664,3,"It does however feel a bit dated, and given its large size, it could do with a refurbishment.",2015-09-18
2,3664,4,"The amenities here are very good, including ""The Bar"" where a large selection of cocktails from all parts of the World are put together nicely.",2015-09-18
2,3664,5,I recommend the Orange Mojito as a nice one to try!,2015-09-18
2,3664,6,The rooms are again a little bit dated but fairly comfortable.,2015-09-18
2,3664,7,I have been staying on Sheraton hotels (from the same group) and the Westin rooms are definitely not as nice.,2015-09-18
2,3664,8,"One of the best aspects of this hotel is its location, and the fact that is directly connected via underground passage to Ebisu station and the fabulous Ebisu Garden complex, with a great number of restaurants, shops and sitting areas.",2015-09-18
2,3664,9,"So, if you don't mind the slightly dated feel (not a major issue, honestly) the location and proximity to a large number of amenities and near JR stations such as Shibuya and Meguro make this a highly recommended hotel.",2015-09-18
2,3665,1,"Lovely hotel, nice central location.",2015-09-17
2,3665,2,Lovely breakfast options and nice cocktail bar 22nd floor.,2015-09-17

2,3665,5,Typical standard upmarket hotel.,2015-09-17

2,3666,2,"The location is fantastic - close to Ebisu Station (both for JR and Tokyo Metro lines) and, as we found out, connected by an underground walkway on the B1 level.",2015-09-16
2,3666,3,This is very helpful if a typhoon or two comes screaming through.,2015-09-16
2,3666,4,"From Ebisu Station, it's one stop to Shibuya, four to Shinjuku, four to Shinagawa and nine to Tokyo Station on the JR Yamanote Line.",2015-09-16

2,3668,3,Hotel is located at Ebisu.,2015-09-15
2,3668,4,You need to check where Ebisu is on Tokyo metro map.,2015-09-15
2,3668,5,"It is not far from major attractions but cannot say that the ""location is absolutely perfect"".",2015-09-15
2,3668,6,"From hotel, you need to wall to Ebisu Garden and there you can have train or metro.",2015-09-15
2,3668,7,Walk takes 5 min.,2015-09-15
2,3668,8,"While Ebisu is not too central, it is a very elite neighborhood, i would live there if i would move to Tokyo:)",2015-09-15
2,3669,1,"The location is unsurpassable at the Ebisu Beer Garden with access to the Mitsukoshi department store and dozens of other stores, an indoor walkway connection to the Ebisu Train Station which is in the JR train routes.",2015-09-12

2,3670,6,"I found it difficult for my first few days dining in Tokyo due to my dietary requirements (Vegetarian) - I went to the Terrace restaurant on the 1st floor and met Daniel Jäger, He is an outstanding chef - He was able to make me something new everyday and i was not disappointed with the meals.",2015-09-12

2,3672,1,This hotel is in Ebisu.,2015-09-06

2,3675,4,I was especially impressed with the water pressure in the shower and the smartly designed rain shower head which was the best I have seen in a hotel (shower wand is also an option too).,2015-09-04
2,3675,5,My wife really liked the scent of the bath products and even took some left over shampoo home!,2015-09-04
2,3675,6,The hotel is as most reviews note in a quiet part of the city and about 10 minute walk from the Ebisu station.,2015-09-04
2,3675,7,The walk was only a little inconvenient as there are escalators and moving walkways almost the entire way and you can stay under cover the entire time (unless it is after 10pm and the Westin lower level entrance is closed which happened one night).,2015-09-04

2,3675,10,"In terms of improvements, I did wish the exchange rate was a bit better at the front desk, I understand paying somewhat for convenience but it was about 8 yen different than the official rate which is a big difference in my mind.",2015-09-04
2,3675,11,"Other minor items, the shelf in the shower is a bit small for items beyond the provided shampoo and body wash and the towels were on the smaller side (nothing has ever compared to the Conrad Miami towels), but these are very minor items.",2015-09-04
2,3675,12,"In summary, we very much enjoyed our stay here, I found the room very elegant in style, the bed was incredibly comfortable and the service top notch.",2015-09-04
2,3675,13,This was our first time in Tokyo but if I was heading back I almost definitely would stay here again.,2015-09-04

2,3676,11,Our only gripe was with the firmness of the Heavenly Bed. Having stayed in numerous Westin Hotels and even own a Heavenly Bed at home - this was clearly either a very old and worn-out mattress or not the usual pillow-top mattress that is part of the standard Heavenly Bed package.,2015-09-03
2,3676,12,"Again, this was only a minor inconvenience and did not detract from our experience at all.",2015-09-03

2,3677,12,"The Westin signature ""Heavenly bed"" here is slightly less ""fluffy"" then the other Westin properties I have stayed in but it was still very comfortable.",2015-09-01
2,3677,13,The bathroom was beautiful and we absolutely loved it.,2015-09-01
2,3677,14,"Overall, we enjoyed the room but feel that it is about time for the property to do some refurbishments.",2015-09-01
2,3677,15,Executive Lounge provides evening snacks and drinks during the happy hour and also simple breakfast in the morning for guests with access to the lounge.,2015-09-01
2,3677,16,"The staffs manning the Executive Lounge were efficient, courteous and friendly.",2015-09-01
2,3677,17,"Unfortunately due to the availability of many choices for food in the vicinity as well as downtown, we did not sample any of the other restaurants in the property.",2015-09-01

2,3678,4,"Next time I'll just book the room, no breakfast package.",2015-08-30
2,3679,1,I stayed at the Westin when I was in town for work.,2015-08-29
2,3679,2,"The hotel was wonderful, large, a great selection of restaurants and the executive club was a wonderful place for me to hang out when I just needed a place to work.",2015-08-29
2,3679,3,It's about a 10 minute walk to the train station and there's a shopping complex across the street.,2015-08-29

2,3680,3,I would recommend them without hesitation.,2015-08-28
2,3680,4,I would also note that the location of the Westin is not as bad as some of these posts make it out to seem.,2015-08-28
2,3680,5,"At a normal walking pace it is probably no more than 15 minutes walk to Ebisu station, all in a covered walkway.",2015-08-28

2,3681,1,Stayed for a total of 7 nights over a 2 week vacation in Japan.,2015-08-27
2,3681,2,It's a beautiful hotel with the usual high service standards of Japan.,2015-08-27

2,3681,4,Beautiful room with a view of Mt. Fuji on clear days.,2015-08-27
2,3682,1,The room is outdated.,2015-08-24
2,3682,2,The location is far off from main city area of Tokyo.,2015-08-24
2,3682,3,The staffs are untrained.,2015-08-24

2,3684,7,Gym was very small and nothing to get too excited about.,2015-08-22
2,3684,8,Not a lot of choice in terms of machines.,2015-08-22
2,3684,9,Feels overall like it needs a refresh and some extra elements added to justify the cost.,2015-08-22

2,3688,7,"I could get it wired from my family in the US, they could tell me if there is a Western Union type of company I can use, they could charge my AMEX some amount, and give it to me as cash and I was OK with any commission as I was in a really difficult situation.",2015-08-14
2,3688,8,"I had to stop by 3 lunch places one day to find the one that accepts AMEX, I did not have a penny and I don't know anybody in Tokyo.",2015-08-14

2,3693,5,"the breakfast buffet at the restaurant downstairs is pretty tasty but youll have to eat quite a bit to make it worth the $30~ (unless it's included in your rate - then, awesome!) looks like each point im making comes with some kind of caveat...",2015-08-08

2,3719,3,"Firstly, they charge for wifi which in this day and age is criminal, it's not exactly cheap either (1500JPY a day), don't be fooled by the free wifi claims - that's only if your a member of their business reward club.",2015-06-21
2,3719,4,"Secondly, the breakfast restaurant is not big enough for the size of the hotel which means you will likely end up queuing for you morning meal.",2015-06-21
2,3719,5,"Also, for some reason with me they had a blind spot for tea, each time I asked they forgot - longest wait for a cup of tea was over 25 minutes - not really acceptable.",2015-06-21
2,3719,6,"Thirdly, none of the restaurants are open late (even the bar stops serving food before 23:00) so the only option is room service and the menu is very limited - I've had my fill of triple decker sandwiches!",2015-06-21
2,3719,7,I did enjoy my stay but these minor inconveniences stop it getting 5 stars.,2015-06-21
2,3720,1,Stayed here for workshop and found this hotel located strategically 15 minutes away from Ebisu train station.,2015-06-16
2,3720,2,The overall deco of this hotel is based around 18th century French deco which wasn't my fancy.,2015-06-16
2,3720,3,I must give credit to the excellent customer service experience from check in to house keeping and concierge service..two thumbs up.,2015-06-16
2,3720,4,The breakfast selection could have been better as I expected more choices from this property.,2015-06-16
2,3720,5,Nonetheless if you stay here on Sunday I would recommend to try their breakfast at Mai restaurant which serves authentic Japanese breakfast set meals only available on Sunday's.,2015-06-16
2,3720,6,My sleep quality was severely compromised as I found the bed to be too soft for my comfort which caused backache on my lower back.,2015-06-16
2,3721,1,I had another great stay at the Westin Tokyo.,2015-06-13
2,3721,2,This time I stayed for 24 days.,2015-06-13
2,3721,3,"I never feel like I am stuck at a hotel on business here because of the service, staff and location of this property.",2015-06-13

2,3721,6,Hat’s off to him again.,2015-06-13
2,3721,7,"As usual, I really enjoyed the Executive Lounge and the use of the Yebisu Garden Place gym that you get as a guest at the Westin Tokyo.",2015-06-13
2,3721,8,(See my last review of this hotel for more on all this.),2015-06-13
2,3721,9,"I finally had the chance to go to the Compass Rose Sky Lounge on the top floor, which is a nice place for drink before going out for dinner.",2015-06-13
2,3721,10,One small complaint is that the service was painfully slow a couple of times in the lobby bar (in the rotunda lobby area).,2015-06-13
2,3721,11,It really wasn’t busy either of these times and I got the sense that we were being ignored because I saw the waiters serving other guests frequently.,2015-06-13
2,3721,12,I didn’t bother to mention this to management as I forgot about it at the time.,2015-06-13
2,3721,13,I will be back for what I hope will be another great stay very soon!,2015-06-13

2,3722,10,"If have have a family with young children, the distance to the train station might be slightly too far, but for any other type of situation it should be fine.",2015-06-11
2,3723,1,Stayed in this hotel as we travelled during the Cherry blossom period and our usual Tokyo hotel in Shinjuku was fully booked.,2015-06-08
2,3723,2,We arrived in Shinjuku train station from Osaka on the bullet train.,2015-06-08
2,3723,3,Easier to take taxi from station as the hotel is a few stations away unless you are travelling with light luggage.,2015-06-08
2,3723,4,You certainly would not want to carry your heavy luggage up and down the escalators.,2015-06-08
2,3723,5,"We arrived about an hour before check in time which is 3pm.and was ushered to the check in counter, the staff was efficient but not the usual friendly welcome you receive in Japanese hotel especially a five star hotel.",2015-06-08

2,3723,12,Across the hotel is a big open courtyard which is quite lovely to sit out when the weather is fine.,2015-06-08

2,3723,16,We stayed here for four nights and I felt that was quite nice but not as impressive as some of the hotels I stayed in Japan.,2015-06-08
2,3723,17,However the hotel has a beautiful garden beside the hotel.,2015-06-08
2,3724,1,"My stay did not start well, with a very arrogant ( double surprising in Tokyo) female check-in staffer.",2015-06-07

2,3732,6,"Very important recommendation: If traveling via the train, follow the directions through the metro area on the walkways, BUT instead of going outside and walking through the park area where the roadway is not even and you will encounter many steps, it's best to make a right after the last walkway, by the information booth inside the terminal and take the escalator downstairs to a nice, even walk to the end of the tunnel to your Westin.",2015-05-29

2,3737,6,"Prices for food here are very high, but the quality is also, service is Japanese ( which means perfect) The location is a matter of preference, it's not in the busy downtown area ,but the subway is close by ( 15 minutes walk) and that will do.",2015-05-23
2,3737,7,"Right across the street you will find a very next nice mall, lots of upscale dining and shopping.",2015-05-23

2,3738,8,"For example, we asked for a lively bar near the hotel and were sent to a ""locals"" bar in the middle of a housing estate -- disappointing when there is more nightlife in Tokyo than you could ever experience in a life time.",2015-05-19
