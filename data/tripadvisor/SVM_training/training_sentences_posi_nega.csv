The bathroom was spacious with a lovely cedar bath and we loved those heated toilet seats! What made the hotel exceptional for us was the fantastic service from the women at reception. Almost each night we would ask for a restaurant recommendation based on what we felt like eating and they always came up with something delicious.

I went to the aquarium and the shirotori garden with it ( took me 1h-1h30) but it was great being able to see the city. And I had no problem parking.

The bus is waiting for you when you get off the ferry - little tip if you are short on time: you can leave your bags on the bus and they will be taken straight to the hotel and will be waiting for you in your room when you get there later. This gives you the option to get off along the route and visit some of the galleries and the interesting Art House project, worked well for us as we spent one day on Naoshima and the following day on Teshima island had a lot to see in a short time. Both islands are so peaceful and making even a busy stay relaxing.

Stayed in room 412 (twin room) with a beautiful view of the woods for as far as the eye could see. It was very relaxing and peaceful to wake up to the view every morning. Reasonably priced for what's included (no slippers or showercap), it had superb shower pressure (hand held shower with a wall mount) and it almost felt like a massage when the water hit my back. There was also a deep bath for soaking after a big day on the slopes. Toilet was separate so it was a great room to share with my friend. Overall a quiet, clean and comfortable room with good Wi-Fi connection. Breakfast was included every day (served in an adjoining building) and had a good spread of bacon, eggs, sometimes sausauges, green salad, toast and fruit. They also had strong green tea bags which I had after my coffee to kickstart my day. Other pluses included free use of washing machine+dryer - you just need to pay 100 yen (or thereabouts) for a laundry liquid capsule from the front desk. Great ski room that dried everything overnight, two drink vending machines, one had beer/sochu for sale and finally the onsen (hot spring bath) that's onsite, definitely worth a visit as all the aches from a day of riding melted away after a short soak. It wasn't very busy when I was there so it was basically a private room for one. Finally, the fluent English speaking and super helpful team. For those that are not comfortable with travelling in a foreign country where they don't speak the language, there is just no issue here at all. A mix of Japanese (who lives/lived overseas) and foreign staff (American, Australian etc.), it just felt like being on any other English speaking mountain. They also gave great advise: about where to eat and helped booked restaurants, which mountain to visit (there's about 4 mountains besides Happo One accessible by bus: Tsugaike, Iwatake, Hakuba 47 and Goryu), how to get to the nearest lift Sakka (, part of Happo One) via a short walk and ski/snowboard straight there (vs about 10min walk down the main road or wait for the bus), and even how to get rid of your heavy snowboard bag after your trip and get it mailed straight to the airport!! Being a girl and travelling without the hubby this time that was the best advise I got! For about 22USD I didn't have to lug my 20kg snowboard bag with me to the next part of my trip (note: you need to allow a couple of days given the remote location). They also drove us to all our dinner reservations and back to the bus terminal upon departure. Thank you so much Team! Very peaceful and refreshing stay. Good for young families too. Look forward to visiting again soon with the family!",1,2017-03-31

The room had unbelievable views and was a mountain view suite room 307, it was a large open room with King bed and king single bed and loads of room to store bags and relax. The bathroom had a separate toilet and a shower room which was amazing. I needed to hire some skis so Sam took me up to a ski hire place and i was fitted with the current seasons skis and boots at extremely good prices. The hotel also had a drying room and lockers to store your ski gear overnight so that it didnt clutter up your room. The hotel was approx 300 metres downhill from Goryu ski resort and while you could walk easily to it there always seemed to be somebody at the Japan Powder offices who would drop you home or at the least take your skis for you. The room was cleaned and made up every day for you and for that we must thank Kelly. We were introduced to John the meet and greet and courtesy bus driver who is a champion bloke and he went out of his way to make sure we had a great time. I can honestly say that John played a large part in making this one of the best trips I have ever had, nothing was a problem and his stories about what he had got up to during the day were something to look forward to. Both John, Sam and Rob were also helpful in giving advice if we decided to eat out at local japanese restaurants and on every occasion that we did eat out the food was unbelievable. On one occasion there was a major sporting event on back in Australia and Akbar explored every possible way to get it on the TV for us and managed to secure the event and most of the hotel stayed and partied late into the night. Akbar could quite easily have said it was not available but he went out of his way to make an enjoyable night. Sam also took a group of us to Cortina a ski resort further down the valley (apprx 40 Minutes drive) on his day off and skied with us all day and showed us around the place. The Hakuba Valley and all the different ski resorts were sensational. I have nothing but praise for the Aqua Alpine Hotel, Japan Powder and all the staff and cant thank them enough and how special they made my trip.

The location next to the Shinjuku station is convenient especially if you take the Narita express.,1,2016-06-11

Our room was beautiful, large, with traditional tatami, screens and wall hangings, but also had a very new modern bathroom. A dressing room was an extra plus, a nice place to keep the luggage out of the way. We didn't book a meal package, but we did eat at the attached cafe and it was great, very tasty udon noodles. The location was extremely handy, and best of all you get to experience Miyajima without all the crowds, its so peaceful. A worthwhile stay, don't miss it!",1,2012-04-17

He is always happy to drive you to the supermarket or train station and when the local shuttle stopped running early, he drove us to the nearby resorts. The accommodation is very comfortable. We had room 207 which is very spacious. Nic was only too happy to make adjustments to our room when we asked for some extra bed lamps and side tables. Having a large commercial kitchen to use was a real bonus as we didnt always feel like going out to eat after a day on the slopes and a relaxing onsen. Unfortunately I hurt my knee while skiing so Nic took me to the local hospital. It was invaluable having Nic and Mami help with communications with the hospital staff. We can highly recommend Red Warehouse and we enjoyed it so much we plan on going back next year.",1,2015-03-20

So long as you're ok with being naked in front of other women (who aren't paying any attention to you anyways) do it, do it, do it. You will look forward to it again and again.

Nishiki market, gion street, pontocho, yasaka shrine, and an easy access to bus or subway to anywhere. I took the subway Hankyu line to easily get to the Arashiyama. In terms of their service, it exceeded my expectation. Staffs speak English much better than I anticipated. Also, their knowledge in the area is amazing. I got so much help from the staff members. I asked them about how to get to attraction sites and the staff member provdied a detailed information along with a map to get there. They also knew many famous restaurants with lots of variety. As my fellow companion was a vegeterian, we asked for a vegeterian restaurant and he was able to provide many ones near the hotel. Moreover, I asked them to make a reservation for a Santa Mariah Cruise ship for Osaka even after I checked out. Hotel itself is quite great as well. They have a public bath on the second floor, which is maintained nicely. It is very clean and warm water soothed out all the exhaust from travelling in Kyoto. Everytime you walk in the corridor, there is a peaceful classic music. The perfume or air freshner they used was also very pleasant. We stayed in a standard twin room without a bath tub.

The maids do a spectacular job every day! (We always felt like we were walking into a new room when we returned from our day out). The free breakfast every morning is not only convenient, but extremely delicious!

The hotel also had a very elegant and professional air about it, but was not overbearingly fancy! The place is almost indescribable. We almost didn't want to check out, we loved it so so so much.

I'm not one to collect hotel toiletries but I made an exception in this case, as they use full-size bottles and the quality and scent absolutely superb ( a heavenly concoction called Lemon Verbana). The Intercon is located at the heart of Osaka too, so many shopping areas, restaurants, bus stops and subways are nearby. Most, if not all of the staff have a very good command of English, so even our kids found it easy to communicate with them. They are also prompt to reply to emails (we had questions prior to arrival) and will go one step further to assist guests. Classic example: My 10 month old baby ran out of formula and I asked the staff if they could possibly find a store which carried his brand (Similac). I wasn't all that concerned; if they could not locate one nearby, I was happy to use whatever Japanese equivalent I could find. Apparently, my husband, who spoke to Concierge, may have come off as a little more frantic than we actually were, and by that afternoon, I was informed that they were waiting for Monday morning so they could could call the company in the United States to ask who their distributor was in Osaka. Holy cow! Gym and swimming pool also top-notch. They were also happy to book restaurant reservations for us and give us step-by-step instructions how to go places. The staff was so kind, responsive and eager that I am still giving them a 5-star rating",1,2016-01-04

We reserved a superior triple suite because I was traveling with my teenage daughter, the room is very spacious with a separate lounge area, private balcony, and a modern updated bathroom. Sundries are provided by Shiseido and a 7-11 convenience store is located downstairs which carries everything from snacks to ready-made bento boxes.

From the rooms, you get an excellent view of the sea and the early morning sunrise - at which point the Japanese flag design is presented to you in full colour. The town of Beppu is well worth a wander, not least for the stunning natural hot springs that occur everywhere. Looking down on the city from one of the hills, you can see steam rising across the whole landscape. This hotel provides a traditional Japanese breakfast (very fishy) - but there is toast and juice.

The lounge has some great staff with both Harada san who checked us in and Watanabe san made sure that every guests felt welcome and looked after, She demonstrated the typical Japanese politeness and very fluent in English. Rooms were large for Japanese standards with most rooms offering great views of the Rainbow Bridge.

Staffs are really really helpful - when I just arrived, the owner (I believe she is Kyoko-san) assisted me with directions and make sure I was properly settled down. I've never tried walking in the street while wearing the yukata so I decided to do just that in the evening for some fun and experience. On my way out, she specially went to bring me a traditional coat to wear over the yukata so I would be warm in the cold weather. Special mention to her daughter too, for she saved me from my luggage woes. I used the luggage delivery service (takkyubin) back in Osaka to send my baggage over to my lodging in Takayama and one should always select motobarai. ie prepayment so the the recipient bears no charges.",1,2016-11-19

Before arrival - We made reservations directly with the hotel and it was prompt and seamless. We asked the hotel concierge to help with restaurant reservations; concierge was responsive, warm and friendly, gave great recommendations and we were totally impressed when they sent us an itinerary of our stay with restaurant booking details (date, time, restaurant address, contact persons name etc). They also kindly handled our late changes without any fuss. On arrival - other than the usual professional check-in expected of a world class 5-star hotel, they had printed a copy of our itinerary and maps of the restaurant showing where they are and how to get there. We were most impressed. Hotel hardware - Hotel is contemporary, and elegantly and tastefully furnished. The lobby is impressive and the room size decent. As with most Japanese hotels, the room (including linen and towels etc) is clean. The grounds around (palace and moat) lend an air of peace and tranquility, and a touch of Japanese tradition. The view from the room is great - lots of greenery and the palace grounds. Ive also stayed at the Peninsula Tokyo and Mandarin Oriental Tokyo in the last year, both are fantastic hotels",1,2017-12-29

Opposite the hotel is a big car park and if you wander over there (it's not too far) you are in a shopping mall called Ikspiari which is huge and has a food court, supermarket, Disney store etc. You can easily catch the Disney monorail from here too which was a fantastic service and frequent too.

The walk was easy even in 85-90 degree heat. Plus, you are a two block walk from Yoyogi park. Nice. The front desk was helpful and spoke decent english.

From the moment you are welcomed, you are looked after. Your room has a small entrance where you remove your shoes, and then you will step up into your bedroom/living room. A small low table and two chairs are there, but while you are enjoying dinner, these are replaced by your futons. It is assumed you will bathe in the onsen on the top floor, so do not expect too much of your bathroom. The dinner is all inclusive and is very Japanese with delicacies, pickles, mouthwatering beef, fish, local apple wine, matcha, and of course you will wear your yukata so you can get into it properly ! The futons were extremely comfortable and we had a very good nights sleep. Breakfast is also Japanese style so expect more raw fish, soup, salad - just be brave and attempt a little out of every dish in front of you. When you are ready to leave, a taxi is summoned and you are waved off by the whole staff and made to feel so special.

The apartment is super modern and extremely clean throughout and very spacious. We were very happy with the choice.

52,39496,1,We were visiting Tokyo for the first time and chose the Tobu for its location - very close to Kinshicho Station which has both a JR line and a Metro station.

You couldn't sleep more than one in each. Check-in was an absolute breeze. We came around 7pm from the airport and they were all ready for us. We had been expecting a package and they advised they had already sent it up to the room. The room was really comfortable with all the amenities you could think of needing in the bathroom, including a hairdryer, and every day they gave us three bottles of water to drink. We were out every day from early till late and didn't use any facilities in the hotel other than our room but it was always immaculately made up when we returned every night.",1,2017-01-25

At least 3 Lawsons in the area, one of which has a connecting door to the hotel. They have a variety of onigiri and whatnots. 4. Tully's Coffee is just downstairs. There's a connecting door at the lobby. Their coffee rocked! And so did their waffle. And yes, a Starbucks is nearby. 5. Restaurant recommendation: Goette Steak (their dry-aged steak and their hamburg were oh my goodness).

2067,174854,1,"Ok, so its usually cooler to say that youve stayed at a traditional ryokan, with its tatami mats and minimalist accoutrements, but when youve got a reputed brand name like the Hyatt offering all guests absolutely free champagne (the good stuff), wines, beers etc from 4-7pm every day, Id give up the so-called authentic ryokan experience in a heartbeat! Now I know this might make me sounds like a bit of a tipple-happy traveler but, believe me  when youre at an area known for its amazing onsens (hot springs baths) and where its traditional to go the full monty in the onsens, having a bubbly or two in your system does wonders to loosen you up to give the naked strutting about a try. Hakone is home to several sulphuric hotsprings, known for their healing properties, and a visit to an onsen is a must. To be frank, we chose the Hyatt because of the loyalty programme, so we had a free night and a discounted night, otherwise we would have probably gone down the traditional ryokan route. At 1st we thought we may regret it, but once in, all the comfort and service of a top-notch hotel kicked in, and we were thrilled about our decision. Getting to Hakone is a breeze from Tokyos Shinjuku station  just get on the ""Romance Car"", a high-speed train that gets you to paradise in slightly more than an hour. Tip: its more value for money to take the Romance Car than the bullet train, and you get reserved seats and a direct trip to Odawara station, which is where the hotels shuttle bus will pick you up from. Thereon, its about 45 minutes up and up the winding hills of Hakone (or were they mountains? Cant tell, but they were really high) before reaching the Hyatt. We were shown to a beautiful and big room, unfortunately it was cloudy throughout, which is common in summer it seems, so no views of Mt Fuji to be had, but a lovely room with a balcony and great bed too. In the room, you will find yukata (like a Japanese bathrobe) that you wear when you visit the onsen but amazingly, I saw many Japanese wearing the yukata during the happy hours at the lounge  quite fun to see them carrying around champagne flutes dressed in what looked like bathrobes! Of course, the 2nd day I was there, I had to do the same  In fact, dont be surprised to see them wearing this even at dinner or breakfast. Speaking of which, both nights we were there, we had the most amazing meals for dinner. 1st night was French, and it surpassed our expectations. My hubby ordered a quail for main, and an entire, plumptious quail appeared before him. 2nd night we tried the Japanese restaurant, and that was a fine-dining sushi experience, something like omakase style and we tried melt-in-your-mouth buttery soft slices of raw fish/seafood. Suffice to say, the hotel really has its dinner service perfected to an art. You must make reservations as soon as you check in though, as the hotel isnt located in an area with other restaurants, your best bet is to dine in, and its really good stuff anyway. I also managed to try the spa at the hotel  had a facial, just before we checked out, heading to the airport, and it was a good thing I did as a last indulgence in Hakone. You can take the ""Romance Car"" back to Shinjuku and from there, the Narita Express to the airport. All in all, top marks for the Hyatt, a perfect getaway from the buzziness of Tokyo, keeping the Japanese charm and at the same time, providing all the expected comforts of a top hotel.",1,2013-08-03

There was a shoji screen for window covering and you could slide one up to see outside. Staying there in July, the AC worked wonderfully! The bathroom was also nice with a shower, tub, and cool Japanese toilet. We also really loved the Shiseido Uminela bath products. There is free wifi, a refrigerator, and complimentary bottles of water daily. Location is also a strength of this hotel. Across the street are numerous shops, a convenience store, and restaurants/cafes - even a Starbucks if you need some coffee from home.

You have to store your shoes at the locker area, and the staff would wipe your luggage wheels before bringing them up to your room. Of course, some people are not used to walk around with bare feet, so the hotel also provides socks as a 'back up plan'. As an onsen hotel, it provides you kimono and towels, more considerate, they have baskets for you to bring your stuff to the onsen floor.

We stayed 2 nights in a corner suite and from the moment we arrived by cab from Kyoto Station, the service was impeccable. We were taken directly to our room and the check in was completed in the room. The suite had a separate living room and master bedroom with an adjoining massive bathroom complete with a shower and separate full bath. There was another half bathroom outside near the living room. The room had remotely controlled blinds and curtains and we had a beautiful view of the fiver behind the property. The living room had Apple TV and we streamed our favorite shows from our Apple devices using AirPlay. We had breakfast in the restaurant which had a good selection of hot and cold items for 3500 yen. For an egg dish, add another 1000. There is a Pierre Herme pastry shop in the hotel and we couldn't get enough--only having been able to enjoy them in Paris in the past. The hotel is a short 10 minute walk to the nearest underground stations across the river. And a cab to Kyoto station cost 2000yen over20-25 minutes. Kinkakuji shrine is a 25 minute drive and Gion is about 15 minute although you could use the underground to get close to that location. The pool is a wonderfully designed full length pool with steam and sauna rooms. There is a fitness room and dos adjacent.

Many of these companies even rent electric bikes, which will come in handy on many of rides up to the shrines and temples that are located high on hills. Drop by the tourist information center in Kyoto station to pick up the rental bike company brochures, as well as other information you might be interested in seeing/doing in Kyoto, and a map!

There were plenty of elevators, and we didn't wait more than 1 minute for one during our stay. Our hotel package came with half board, and both the dinner and breakfast buffets were top notch! Very high quality food, and professional cooking staff, and the flavors representing world cuisine were as close to authentic as you can get. This was probably the main perk that stood out during our entire stay, as I made sure to take advantage and sample everything on the menu (I was hurtin' after!!). My wife had a wonderful experience at the spa, getting the facial/aroma massage package which came with a surprise discount that we were not aware of (great customer service), and I opted for the onsen/public bath, which was very rejuvenating.

We had a Japanese style room on the 3rd floor which has an excellent view of the ocean (Japan Sea) from the room, and from the hallway outside of the room a view of the great volcanic mountain which dominates the area. The main bath (Ofuro) was clean, the temperature of the bath properly hot, and there is a view of the sea from both the main bath and the rotenburo outside. Our room was very ample in size, clean and stocked with the standard amenities, free Wi-Fi is available and for those of us without a portable computer there is a computer terminal in the lobby for use by guests. They have a very large gift shop with a good selection of regional specialties in addition to the normal nick knacks. While we were too tired to go down and listen their was a brief 'concert' by a local Shamisen artist in the evening accompanied by a drummer. If you have not heard this three string plucked 'banjo' before it would be worth your while to attend. Dinner was served in the dining room and was generally excellent, the waiter was quite helpful, and food was well prepared and well presented. Breakfast is served buffet style in a large conference/meeting room. It was MORE than adequate in quanity with both Japanese and a good selection of western dishes. Frankly given the remote location, size of the town and age of the hotel I had expected far less than what we got, the price was 17,000 yen per person, mid-week which I thought was quite inexpensive for what we received. I highly recommend a trip on the Gonou LIne to see the coast of Japan, and strongly recommend that after your trip down from Tokyo you stay at this hotel in Ajigasawa before completing your journey the next day.

The TV had no major English channels, which was extremely odd, as channels such as CNN or BBC are standard for a hotel of this level in this country. An odd thing about the room was that there was no iron/press in the huge room, and you had to call the front and ask to borrow one. Another big disappointment happened with the room service on one of these expensive days; our room was not serviced until afternoon. We were a couple with a child in the room, but they left only two large bath towels every day. It is not hard to imagine that a family of 3 may need more towels in 24 hrs, so I called them at around 11am and asked for fresh towels. They said OK, but the room service staff came with the towels after more than 3 hours. I already had to take shower and dry up using wet/used towels. Be ware that the front staff and most others were unable to efficiently communicate in English, and that is another disadvantage for a 5 star facility. There was no guard in the parking lot to guide drivers for parking, another substandard point for a big hotel. There was no pool-side bar/restaurant open in late June. The beach in the photos is a public beach quite distant from the hotel, and so the hotel is not a beach resort. In addition, the backdoor way towards the beach is partially unpaved, and therefore it is not suitable for a baby car. The cheering and drum noise from the baseball stadium virtually ruined our relaxation time for a few hours for two days. Some of the spa/pool staff were not as friendly they should have been.

When we finally entered the hotel premises, what first impressed us was a guy in suit greeting our car on the driveway. He was holding a list with guests checking in that day. We were told to go to the ROYAL TERRACE for check in. Different buildings got their own check in I guess. When we arrived at the Royal Terrace, a French guy helped with our luggage and took our car for parking. Oh, they got valet!!! The front desk area is of a simple, yet elegant design. We entered our room and it looked really elegant (again, simple luxury). The balcony, the in-room music, the welcome hors d'oeuvre, the BVLGARI shampoo, the bathtub with an amazing view, the complimentary mini-bar, the super comfy bed. Oh gosh, I was spoiled!!! We walked around the hotel premises before sunset and found out different restaurants are located in different areas, with a couple of restaurants (the sushi and the kaiseki) occupying two little houses. Really cute and elegant. We picked the Teppanyaki because it seems like that restaurant got a great view of Nagasaki. The food turned out to be really great! The beef from Iki Island melted in my mouth! The next morning we had breakfast in the same restaurant. It wasn't a loud buffet but rather a very decent breakfast served yet you still got plenty to eat. It was a very memorable stay. Too bad we only allocated one night in Nagasaki. I'd love to return and stay in this hotel for two nights at least. My conclusion is you can buy luxury but you can't buy taste. This hotel got both!

Additionally Yu gave them a tour to Iriomote and they loved her accompany and conversation. Also, Victor from the Tour Desk went out of his way to make them feel welcome.

The performances on this visit were few notches up from our last. The dancers were especially talented and our family especially enjoyed watching Mina and Mizuki and of course Saad who is a great all around entertainer, dancer and comedian. We all loved being around with Saad, especially our kids and his wonderful performance at the show every night. The after show entertainment at the bar was always fun and Ahmed came up with some great events that were new to us including Sumo and Casino night (which was hit with both the in-laws and the kids). Last but not least we have to thank our favorite GO and friend Mizo. Of course he always treats us like family, but he went out above and beyond showing my in-laws a great time. On the archery range, he not only helped my son and daughter, but had my 70 year old father-in law hitting the center mark.

The room itself was partitioned into 2 and included a sunken table with a heater underneath. Wifi signal is good and is complimentary. The wooden floor is also heated and it's a lovely way to spend a lazy afternoon, rosy from a leisurely soak in the outdoor rock pool, sitting on a cushion on a warm floor with the sliding door open just a crack to let in a cool breeze. Dinner was a grand affair. we were seated in a common room at a table around an open hearth, where we cooked some of our food, which included river trout, rice cakes on skewers, local miso and other local food from the area and beautiful melt in your mouth Hida beef which we grilled on a stone in the hearth. Breakfast was also served in the same room and was equally delightful.",1,2016-01-27
